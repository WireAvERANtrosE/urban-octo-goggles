## Invasion
"Load faster!" 

"Don't let your fingers tremble, insert each bullet into the cartridge one by one!" 

"The comrades in the front line need the ammunition you load, if you're too slow, the enemy will rush over and kill you!" 

"Don't look around, just focus on your own fingers!" 

"As long as your comrades are still shooting, don't stop moving!" 

In the First Army barracks, Lord Brian was loudly urging the new recruits to practice loading, and Nails was one of them. 

He wasn't really a new recruit, he was even an old member of the First Army—ever since the militia triumphed over the demonic beasts under the leadership of the Prince, he had joined the team at the strong request of Iron Axe. According to Iron Axe, fighting the enemy with a musket and defending Prince Roland and Miss Nana was much more promising than mining in the mines for a lifetime. 

Not long after Nails enlisted, the militia was reorganized into the First Army. Besides fighting demonic beasts, he followed Lord Roland and Lord Iron Axe to defeat the great nobles, something he couldn't even dare to think about before, and overturned Duke Ryan's throne. Even the large army of the new King Timothy couldn't set foot in Border Town. After these battles, he had become a squad leader of the gun squad. 

However, according to the customs of the First Army, whenever a large number of new recruits joined, some veterans would be arranged to be embedded in the newly formed teams to serve as instructors for the recruits, practicing with them and living together. At first, Nails was reluctant when he was selected, as it meant he couldn't stand on the front line with his familiar companions immediately. But thinking back to his own enlistment, when he too was guided by the old members of the militia, he accepted the task.



At that time, the veteran who served as the guide for our team was Lord Brian, who has now become the commander of the First Battalion of the Gun Squad.

Nail hoped that one day he too could wear the medal bestowed by His Highness the Prince and issue orders in front of nearly a thousand people. Ironhead was indeed right; this profession was much better than operating the steam engine in front of the mines.

"Sir, how long do we have to practice this?" A young lad in the squad he was responsible for grumbled, "It's still snowing."

"Until you can complete this action within five breaths with your eyes closed," Nail stopped in front of him. "You're called Haimon, right? Remember to shout 'report' before speaking, that's the rule of the First Army!"

"Report," the short fellow next to Haimon called out, his hands still moving, "Will we have eggs to eat tonight too?"

This comment elicited a chorus of swallowing sounds from the squad.

Nail couldn't help but curl his lips upward. To maintain good discipline among these new recruits from the northern and southern boundaries of the kingdom, even in snowy weather, it took half a month of uninterrupted training and stick education, as well as enough food to fill them up—oatmeal and dried salted meat were staples, with occasional small pieces of pickled fish, and even an egg. However, the latter only appeared in the meal after skirmishes with demonic beasts or field training exercises.

"That depends on whether the demonic beasts will come to trouble Border Town," he shrugged, "Your name?"

"Aike, sir."



"The bullet in your hand has been stuffed for quite some time now, my next-door granny is more agile than you," Nail put away his smile and spoke seriously, "If you're still like this before practice ends, forget about eggs, even your portion of meat porridge will be canceled!"

Everyone immediately lowered their heads, it seemed that no one was willing to be punished with a dinner ban.

Just then, a rapid tolling of bells came from the city wall lookout.

Beasts were attacking.

"Cease practice!" Brian bellowed, "Each squad instructor leads your men to the city wall area, prepare for battle!"

"Did you all hear that?" Nail urged, "Take your ammunition, don't leave any behind, just as we do in regular training, line up to mount the battlements. Our position is at the fourth stretch of the wall, move it!"

To think I might actually get to eat an egg, he thought to himself.

...

Upon reaching the designated position, Nail saw that the gunners were already prepared, calmly conducting a final check of their firearms faced with the faintly emerging tide of darkness in the distance, then rested the barrels on the crenellations.



Nails couldn't help feeling a bit regretful; he could have been holding a revolving rifle himself, teaching these beasts a harsh lesson.

One by one, the bullets were inserted into the loader, then placed within easy reach of the front row. Behind each veteran soldier, one or two people were responsible for loading, and when necessary, they could fire all five rounds in one go, their firepower incomparably stronger than the old flintlock muskets they had used before.

"Look, the witches are coming!" Haimon whispered.

"They are really... beautiful," Aike muttered, "Before coming here, based on the church's descriptions, I thought they were both ugly and terrifying."

"Is that all you notice?" the former scoffed disdainfully, "Didn't you see in the last battle, the woman carrying the giant sword and the splendor of her strike as she cut down the hybrid demonic beasts? If only I had that kind of power."

"What if that truly is the power of the devil—"

"Bullshit!" Nails shouted, "Miss Nana is also a witch; is she a devil, then?" He then lowered his voice and continued, "If you dare to say such things in front of the veterans of the First Army, I guarantee you'll be bruised and swollen the next day. She is the angel of the town, the power of the divine, got it? Now focus on loading; this is no practice!"

After scolding the blabbermouths, Nails took the chance to glance ahead. This time, the demonic beast horde didn't seem much different from usual; it looked like it wouldn't take too long to clear the battlefield... Wait, what was that?

Among the black tide, there appeared to be an exceptionally large figure. At first, he thought it was a Turtleback Siege Beast, but the silhouette seemed even bigger, and its movement speed much faster.



As the enemy drew closer, Nails couldn't help but widen his eyes in shock—it was a massive demonic beast the likes of which he had never seen before! Its huge tusks were almost thicker than a man's torso, like scythes laid across its face, and its limbs as sturdy as stone pillars kicked up layers of snow mist as it ran. With each step, the ground trembled slightly. The four-meter-high city wall didn't even reach the beast's lower jaw; if it charged straight at them, the mud wall would probably shatter instantly.



Artillery!



Without a doubt, muskets would be of limited use against such a colossal creature. Only the big guns of the artillery squad could stop its advance! And among them, the most powerful was undoubtedly the new long-barreled cannon on the sixth segment of the wall.



"My God, look there," the cries of the new recruits rose from behind, "What kind of monster is that?"



"May the gods save us, is that a demon from hell?"



"Shut your mouths and keep doing what you're supposed to do!" Nails swallowed hard and looked towards the new cannon. The barrel, reflecting silver light, had begun to move. The straight muzzle slowly turned, aiming in the direction of the charging beast.



A dazzling flash of light blazed forth, followed by a deafening boom!
