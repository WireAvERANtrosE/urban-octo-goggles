## Bombs and Liquor
The day after the witches from Sleeping Island were relocated, Roland summoned the City Hall's Chief Officer Barov to his office.



"I need you to post a recruitment notice," he pushed the drafted content in front of the other party, "It's for a short-term job of about a week, around ten people, preferably women."



Barov picked up the paper and read it carefully, "Your Highness, may I ask what starch is?"



"You know what flour is, right?"



The Chief Officer hesitated, "Do you mean coarse flour or fine flour? Crushed wheat can be baked into bread or made into wheat cakes, and the flour you eat is further sieved to remove the bran. The output of the latter is only sixty percent of the former, producing softer bread, but it's very expensive, only the great nobility can afford it."



This former assistant minister of finance's most satisfying point to Roland was his thorough understanding of various common commodities. Due to the backwardness of agriculture and the scarcity of food, the same thing was eaten completely differently by different classes. For example, the most common wheat, commoners would simply boil the shelled wheat grains into a porridge, making the most out of the food, although some remaining husks and sand would also end up in the pot, often making it gritty and hard on the teeth when eaten.



Small nobility were somewhat more particular; they would have people sieve the wheat to remove the sand, grind it into coarse flour, and then enjoy it baked into bread and pancakes.



Moving up were the wealthy great nobility, for whom food was no longer merely a tool to fill the stomach but a means to pursue delightful tastes. Their kitchens would further sieve the flour to remove the bran, obtaining snow-white, refined flour, from which bread baked was a milky yellow color, tasting not only finer in texture but also much sweeter.



"Starch is made by continuing to refine and process the delicate wheat flour," Roland spread his hands, "After you recruit the people, I will send someone to tell them the specific methods."



"Continue processing?" Barov couldn't help but widen his eyes, "That would use up so much wheat."

"I don't need too much, three to four hundred kilograms..." Roland paused, then corrected himself, "Just a basket as big as my desk will do."

He nodded in agreement, then asked, "Why do you request that they be women as much as possible?"

"Because they are more meticulous in their work. Moreover, I want to see more women take up jobs instead of being idle at home," Roland suddenly thought of something, "The general education currently being promoted in Border Town seems to progress faster with the girls, doesn't it?"

"Although the main person in charge of the Ministry of Education is Lady Scroll, the situation is indeed such. Apart from taking care of children and household chores, they don't have much else to do, so most of their time is spent on reading and writing."

"In that case, I require that after the next round of assessments, the City Hall under your charge must recruit a group of female apprentices and gradually increase the proportion of women in positions," Roland instructed.

"Your Highness, this... there is no precedent," Barov frowned, "If we're just talking about being meticulous, my apprentices are not inferior to any woman."

"If there is no precedent, then create one," Roland said bluntly, "This is also the simplest and quickest way to increase the workforce without expanding the total population. If all women can take on the task of building the town, my available manpower could double. What you need to do is to guide people to change their mindset—as long as the pay is attractive, I believe they will step forward one by one."

After Barov left, Nightingale whispered in the prince's ear with a laugh, "What delicious thing are you planning to make again?"



"Starch? No, it's not for eating," Roland sipped his tea, "Although it is true that a decent ingredient can be obtained in the process of making it."



He soaked the fine wheat flour in water and kneaded and washed it until the water turned completely white, then changed the water and continued. What was left was a sticky mass of gluten, which could be deep-fried or stir-fried, offering a tender and elastic texture. After cooking, it could be brushed with honey or sprinkled with spices to make a delicious dish.



However, Roland's focus was not on the food.



After straining and allowing the milky water to settle, the starch that precipitated was the main ingredient for making explosives.



With nitroglycerin not yet in trial mixing and T.N.T. entirely out of the question, nitrocellulose became the easiest explosive to manufacture, with a production process identical to that of nitrocotton. The final product had a low sensitivity, could not be ignited by open flames, and required a detonator to explode. Its power was greater than that of T.N.T. and it was widely used as a substitute during both World Wars.



With high-purity starch available, those alchemy apprentices who were well-versed in the production of nitrocotton could surely quickly produce a batch of nitrocellulose as well.



After lunch, Roland was planning to go back to his room for a nap when there was a sudden knock at the door of his office.



Usually, the person looking for him at this time was most likely Anna. His heart thumped twice—could it be because he fell asleep from exhaustion last time, so she decided to come by at noon?



"Come in."



The door creaked open, and Roland was momentarily startled to see Evelyn standing there.

Uh... this was a bit different from what he had expected. He coughed twice and flashed a genial smile. "Is there something you need?"

She walked over to the desk, bowed her head respectfully, and looked somewhat nervous. "Your Highness, I have a question for you."

Was it going to be the same old question, 'Why are you so good to witches?' But adhering to the spirit of treating comrades with the warmth of spring, he smiled and said, "What's your question? Go ahead and ask."

"Why... did you choose me to come to Border Town?"

Roland was slightly taken aback. Did she think the wine was not to her liking?

"My abilities are neither as versatile as Sylvie's, nor as practical as Lily's and Honey's," she spoke softly, "and if it were just for tasting wine, a monthly salary of one gold royal would be enough to hire a professional winemaker from the capital."

"What do you think of those wines?"

"At first, I thought they were too spicy, but I've grown to accept them after drinking them slowly. As for those mixed drinks with ice cubes, fruit juice, and sugar water, they taste richer. However, this is just my personal opinion," Evelyn answered carefully, "The tavern at home only sells cheap wine and watered-down ale. The preferences of the nobility... I'm not familiar with those."



So it wasn't the wine he was suspicious of, the prince let out a quiet sigh of relief. He got up, opened the bookcase, and took out a can of barley beer from the top shelf and placed it in front of Evelyn. "Can you turn this can of barley beer into the white liquor I brew?"



"I think... there shouldn't be a problem." She stretched out her hands, cradling the can, and soon the murky yellow liquid inside began to change. As bubbles surged, the barley beer became clearer and clearer, until it was as transparent as boiled water, but Roland had already smelled the strong fragrance of alcohol. He couldn't wait to dip his finger in it, put it in his mouth, and the bitterness and burning sensation came at the same time—this was the taste of high alcohol content.



Roland couldn't help but laugh, "This is why I chose you."



Looking at the puzzled face of Evelyn, he clapped his hands and said, "I plan to set up an alcohol plant... no, a distillery. Would you like to be my chief distiller?"
