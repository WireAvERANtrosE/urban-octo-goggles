## Bombs and Alcohol
The day after the witches from Sleeping Island were relocated, Roland summoned the City Hall's Chief Officer, Barov, to his office.



"I need you to post a recruitment notice," he pushed the drafted content in front of the other party, "It's for a short-term job lasting one week, for about ten people, preferably women."



Barov picked up the paper and read it carefully, "Your Highness, may I ask what starch is?"



"You know what flour is, right?"



The Chief Officer hesitated, "Do you mean coarse flour or fine flour? Crushed wheat grains can be baked into bread or made into wheat cakes. But what you eat is further sifted to remove the bran, producing fine flour. The output of the latter is only sixty percent of the former; the bread made from it is softer, but the price is very high, only the great nobles can afford it."



This former assistant finance minister's most satisfying point to Roland was his comprehensive knowledge of various basic goods. Due to the backwardness of agriculture and the scarcity of food, the same thing was eaten completely differently across the social strata. For example, the most common wheat, the method of the common people was to cook the shelled wheat grains directly into porridge, which maximized the use of the food. However, some remaining husks and stones would also be cooked in the pot, often making it crunchy and uncomfortable to eat.



The lesser nobility were a bit more particular; they would have people sift out the stones from the wheat grains, grind them into coarse flour, and then bake it into bread and cakes for consumption.



Moving further up were the wealthy great nobles, for whom food was no longer merely a tool to fill the stomach, but a means to pursue delicious enjoyment. Their kitchens would further sieve the flour to remove the bran, obtaining snow-white refined ground flour. The bread baked from it was beige, and not only was it delicate in texture, but it also tasted much sweeter.



"Starch is produced by continuing to refine and process the delicate wheat flour," Roland spread his hands, "Once you've recruited the people, I'll have someone tell them the specific methods."



"Continue processing?" Barov couldn't help but widen his eyes, "That would use up so much wheat."

"I don't need too much, three to four hundred kilograms..." Roland paused, then corrected himself, "Just a basket as big as my desk will do."

He nodded in agreement, then asked, "Why do you insist on having females as much as possible?"

"Because they are more meticulous in their work. Also, I want to see more women taking up jobs rather than being idle at home," Roland suddenly thought of something, "The universal education currently implemented in Border Town seems to be progressing faster with the girls' classes, right?"

"Although the main person in charge of the Ministry of Education is Lady Scroll, the situation is indeed such. Apart from taking care of children and managing household affairs, they don't have much else to do, so most of their time is spent on reading and writing."

"In that case, I require that after the next round of assessments, the City Hall under your charge must recruit a group of female apprentices and gradually increase the proportion of women in the workforce," Roland instructed.

"Your Highness, this... there's no precedent," Barov frowned, "If it's just about being meticulous, my apprentices are no worse than any woman."

"If there's no precedent, then create one," Roland said bluntly, "This is also the simplest and fastest way to increase the workforce without expanding the total population. If all women can take on the task of building the town, my available manpower could double. What you need to do is to guide people to change their mindset — as long as the salary is enticing, I think they will stand up one by one."

After Barov took his leave, Nightingale whispered in the prince's ear with a laugh, "What delicious thing are you planning to make now?"



"Starch? No, it's not for eating," Roland took a sip of tea, "Although during the processing, one indeed can obtain a fine ingredient."



By soaking refined wheat flour in water, then kneading and washing it until the water turns completely white, and then changing the water to continue. What's left is a sticky mass of gluten, which can be deep-fried or stir-fried, offering a tender and elastic texture. After cooking, it can be coated with honey or sprinkled with spices to make a delicious dish.



However, Roland's focus was not on the food.



After filtering and letting the milky water settle, the sediment that forms is starch, which is also the main ingredient in making explosives.



In the absence of nitroglycerine trials and with T.N.T. nowhere in sight, nitrocellulose became the easiest high explosive to manufacture, with a process identical to that of making guncotton. Its finished product has a low sensitivity, cannot be ignited by open flame, and requires a detonator to explode; its power is even higher than that of T.N.T. It was widely used as a substitute for the latter during both World Wars.



With high-purity starch at hand, those alchemy apprentices who had mastered the production of guncotton would surely be able to quickly produce a batch of nitrocellulose.



After lunch, Roland was planning to go back to his room for a nap when suddenly there was a knock on the door of his office.



Usually, at this time, it was Anna who would come looking for him, nine times out of ten. His heart thumped twice—could it be that she decided to come at noon this time because last time he had been too exhausted and fallen asleep directly?



"Come in."



The door creaked open, and Roland was taken aback—it was Evelyn standing outside.



Uh... this was a bit different from what he had expected. He coughed twice and revealed a friendly smile, "Is there something you need?"



She walked to the side of the table and bowed her head, looking somewhat nervous, "Your Highness, I have a question I wish to ask you."



Was it going to be the same old question, 'Why are you so good to witches'? However, adhering to the spirit of treating comrades as warmly as the spring breeze, he smiled and said, "What's the question? Go ahead and ask."



"Why... did you choose me to come to Border Town?"



Roland was slightly taken aback. Did she dislike the taste of the wine?



"My abilities are neither as versatile as Sylvie's nor as practical as Lily and Honey's," she spoke softly, "Just for tasting wine, a monthly salary of one Gold Royal would be enough to hire a professional winemaker from the capital."



"What do you think of those wines?"



"At first, I thought they were too fiery, but as I drank more, I came to accept them. As for those mixed drinks with ice, fruit juice, and sugar water, they have a richer taste. But that's just my personal opinion," Evelyn cautiously replied, "The tavern at home only sells cheap wines and watered-down ale, so I'm not clear about the preferences of nobility."



So it wasn't that he doubted there was something wrong with the wine; the prince quietly breathed a sigh of relief. He rose to his feet, opened the bookcase, and took out a can of beer from the top shelf and placed it in front of Evelyn, "Then can you turn this can of beer into the distilled spirits that I brew?"



"I think... there should be no problem." She stretched out her hands, holding the can, and soon the murky yellow liquid inside began to change. As the bubbles rose, the beer became clearer and clearer, until it was as transparent as boiled water, but Roland had already smelled the strong aroma of alcohol. He couldn't wait to dip his finger in a bit of it, put it in his mouth, and felt the bitterness and burning sensation that came at the same time, which was indeed the taste of high-proof alcohol.



Roland couldn't help but laugh out loud, "This is why I chose you."



Looking at Evelyn's puzzled face, he clapped his hands and said, "I plan to set up a distillery... no, a brewery, would you like to be my chief brewer?"
