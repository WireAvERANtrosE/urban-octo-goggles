## Hunter and Prey
"Freckles!" someone shouted, "He's injured!"

"Don't touch him!" Brian roared, "I'll check his wounds, you guys keep shooting."

He handed his rifle to the rookie in charge of loading and bent over to reach the injured man. The wounded man was still somewhat conscious and asked shakily, "Captain, am I... am I going to die?"

The spear had pierced diagonally into the lower part of his chest, and it wasn't clear if it had gone all the way through, but since his breathing seemed relatively unobstructed, it probably hadn't hit his lungs. During cultural lessons, His Highness the Prince had once briefly explained the functions of various human organs and emergency measures for injuries. In a case like this, the best thing Brian could think of was to leave it be and wait until after the battle for Miss Nana to treat him.

"Does it hurt?" Brian asked.

Freckles nodded with difficulty.

"Feeling pain means you're not going to die," the knight placed his hand on his forehead, "You know about Miss Nana's abilities, right?"

"Uh-huh," Freckles managed a weak smile, "Everyone always... wants to see her, so that means... I, I can see her too."

"Exactly, so you need to hang in there."



Blair returned to the shooting window after speaking, and the new recruit looked back anxiously, "Shouldn't we pull out the spear?"

"Pulling it out would actually cause more bleeding. You'll understand when you learn these things," he paused, "What we can do now is to defeat the enemy as quickly as possible."

...

Roland stood on the platform, clearly seeing the enemy surge towards the town like a tide.

With each row of bunkers they crossed, their speed slowed down significantly. By the time they crossed the third row of bunkers, the enemy's flanks were fully exposed to the crossfire of the shooters.

The effect of Echo was very evident. Despite the formation being stretched out, most of the troops still followed the witches' continuous commands to "charge together," running along the main road.

Every moment, groups of people fell, unable to do anything about it. Facing defensive fortifications that swords, spears, and guns could not destroy, Timothy's militia could only endure casualties and keep advancing.

Beyond the third row of bunkers, at a distance of three hundred meters, lay the artillery positions—within this range, it was a death zone covered by shotgun fire.

The lightning in the sky had turned the flags into a bright red.



The firing angle of the twenty cannons was leveled, spewing forth flames and thick smoke towards the front. Roland roughly estimated that the most skilled gun crew could fire a round of canister shot in about twenty seconds, while the less adept ones took around half a minute. At first glance, this rate of fire seemed close to that of the excellent gun crews during the American Civil War, but their achievement of three shots per minute was with solid shot, and much of the time was spent on repositioning the cannon and repeatedly aiming. When firing canister shot, there was no need to aim, nor to swab the barrel, so the rate of fire could be pushed even higher.



For the enemy, however, this was a terrifying rate of fire, as canister shot was particularly devastating against unarmored targets. Nearly every iron pellet could penetrate two or three people. Painkillers might stave off the pain, but they couldn't suppress fear. Watching their comrades being turned into sieves, even a heart full of excitement and a thirst for slaughter couldn't overcome the instinctual fear of living beings. Moreover, these were not some iron-willed steel troops to begin with; without the painkillers, these people were nothing more than a group of untrained civilians lacking actual combat experience. When half of their number lay on the assault path, deserters began to appear among the enemy.



Fear spread like the plague, swift and unchecked. With the first deserter, soon followed a second and a third; the vanguard stopped advancing and began to turn around, retreating in disorder. The artillery crew switched back to solid shot, aiming at the center of the road and opening fire, while the musketeers in the bunkers never ceased shooting.



Piles of bodies lay on the main road.

...

Levin's raging fury gradually cooled, and he began to feel fear creeping in.



Over twenty men initially discovered the witch causing chaos, clad in strange attire that nearly blended her into the surrounding scenery when she lay in ambush in the woods. If she had not been guiding the troops towards the center of the road while moving forward with the main force, it would have been nearly impossible for his men to spot her.



Even so, she caused Levin great trouble—he found that the witch's imitated voices were elusive and did not need to come from her mouth. Sometimes they came from the left, sometimes from the right, and sometimes even from behind his own head. The content was also varied, such as mimicking his own accent to issue commands, or the pained cries for help from a militiaman.



But just as they were about to encircle and capture her, the white-dressed woman appeared once again.



Levin revisited the shocking scene where Raymond Hoss was killed in the blink of an eye right in front of him.

He held a silver-white "light crossbow" in his hand, which would take down a person as soon as it burst into sparks and a loud boom.

The encircling pocket was torn apart in an instant, and everyone became like startled birds at that moment. Armor could not defend, shields were useless, and the iron buckler in Levin’s hand was shattered into pieces. The pinholes leaking light on the iron told him how astonishing the power of the opponent's weapon was. The only thing that might compare to it was probably the double-handed heavy crossbow. If it weren't for his instinctive ducking, he reckoned he would have become a corpse by now.

But a heavy crossbow can't be fired in quick succession!

The white witch's ability to appear and disappear at will, coupled with a terrifying weapon that did not require reloading, made Levin realize he had no chance of winning. Once this realization took hold, anger extinguished as quickly as if it had met a cold wind.

"Swallow the pill and kill her when she appears!"

He shouted this, but Levin himself retreated backward, planning to run towards the outskirts of the forest when she focused her attention on the militia.

It was safer to stay with the large group of troops; she would never dare to attack him in the crowd!

This forest also grew quite strangely, with dense weeds almost reaching the knees and vines spread all over the ground, ready to trip someone if they were not careful. Stumbling through the forest, Levin looked ahead, wanting to regroup with the main force, but the scene before him left him dumbfounded.



The effects of the medicine had not yet worn off, and the militia were retreating... no, it would be more accurate to say they were fleeing. Those who ran slowly or had not yet reacted were pushed to the ground and mercilessly trampled by those behind them. They charged like galloping horses and fled in the same manner, triggering a surge of people that kicked up clouds of dust. Levin dared not step forward to stop them.



What on earth had happened? Levin stood frozen in disbelief. Could it be that his force of fifteen hundred had completely collapsed in such a short span of time? And that despite taking the pills! Were the prince's subordinates all monsters?



At that moment, the sound of footsteps trampling on weeds came from behind him. Gritting his teeth, he drew his sword and thrust it backward—In this life-and-death moment, his thrust was even faster than usual, like a bolt of lightning, but what met him was a blinding flash of light. His sword shattered upon impact, sparks flying in all directions, followed by a sharp pain in his right hand, the sensation in his fingertips vanishing instantly.



It was only when Levin shifted his gaze to his arm that he realized half of it was gone, his red and white muscles and bones exposed like a blooming cockscomb flower. The woman in white approached him expressionlessly, and he couldn't help but stumble backward several steps in panic, tripping over himself and falling to the ground.



The witch stepped on his shoulder, her icy weapon pressed against his forehead. From this angle, Levin could see her face hidden beneath the hood.



So... beautiful.



That was his last thought before the gunshot.
