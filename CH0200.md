## Hunter and Prey
"Freckles!" someone shouted, "He's injured!"



"Don't touch him!" Iron Axe roared, "I'll check his wounds; you keep firing."



He handed his rifle to the rookie in charge of reloading and crouched down beside the injured man. The victim was still lucid, shivering as he asked, "Captain, am I... am I going to die?"



The short spear had pierced him just below the chest, and it was unclear whether it went all the way through. Seeing that his breathing was relatively unobstructed, it likely hadn't punctured his lungs. During cultural lessons, His Highness had briefly explained the function of various human organs and the emergency measures to take when injured. In such a situation, the best thing Iron Axe could think of was not to move the victim and wait for the battle to end so that Miss Nana could treat him.



"Does it hurt?" Iron Axe asked.



Freckles nodded with difficulty.



"Feeling pain means you won't die," the knight placed his hand on Freckles' forehead, "You know about Miss Nana's abilities, right?"



"Yeah," Freckles managed a weak smile, "Everyone always... wants to see her. In that case... I'll get to see her too."



"That's right, so you have to hold on."



Blair returned to the shooting window after speaking, and the recruit looked back anxiously, "Don't we need to pull out the short spear?"

"Pulling it out would actually cause more bleeding. You'll understand when you learn these things," he paused, "What we can do now is to defeat the enemy as quickly as possible."

...

Roland stood on the platform, clearly seeing the enemy surge toward the town like a tide.

Each time they crossed a row of bunkers, their speed would significantly slow down. By the time they crossed the third row of bunkers, the enemy's flanks were completely exposed to the crossfire of the shooters.

The effect of Echo was very apparent. Despite the troops being stretched into a long line, most of them still followed the witches' continuous commands to "charge concentratedly," running along the main road.

With every moment, batches of people fell, and there was nothing they could do about it. Facing the defensive fortifications that could not be destroyed by swords, spears, or guns, Timothy's militia could only endure the casualties and keep advancing.

After the third row of bunkers, within three hundred meters, was the artillery position—in this distance, it was the deadly zone covered by shotgun fire.

The lightning in the sky had already changed the flags to a bright red.



The firing angle of the twenty cannons was leveled, spewing flames and thick smoke towards the front. Roland roughly estimated that the most skilled gun crew could fire a canister shot in about twenty seconds, while the slightly slower ones took about half a minute. At first glance, this rate of fire seemed close to that of the excellent artillery crews during the American Civil War. However, the latter's rate of three shots per minute was achieved with solid shot, with much time spent on repositioning the cannon and aiming repeatedly. When firing canister shots, aiming wasn't necessary, nor was there a need to swab the bore, so the rate of fire could be pushed even higher.



For the enemy troops, this was a terrifying rate of fire. Canister shots were especially devastating against targets without armor, with almost every iron ball piercing through two to three people. Painkillers could ward off pain, but not suppress fear. When they witnessed their comrades being torn to shreds, even the excitement and desire for slaughter could no longer suppress the instinctive fear of life. Moreover, they were not exactly a steel-willed army; without the painkillers, these people were merely a group of untrained civilians lacking in actual combat experience. When half of them lay on the charge path, deserters began to emerge among the enemy forces.



Fear spread like a plague, rapidly. Once the first one fled, soon the second and third followed. The vanguard line completely stopped advancing and began to turn around, retreating towards the rear. The artillery crew switched back to solid shot, targeting the center of the road and opening fire, while the musketeers in the bunkers never stopped shooting.



Heaps of bodies lay on the road.



...



Levin's burning rage gradually cooled, and he began to feel fear.



Over twenty men initially discovered the witch causing chaos. She wore strange clothes and blended almost seamlessly with the surrounding scenery when she lurked in the woods. If she had not been moving forward with the main force, continuously guiding people towards the center of the road, his men would have hardly been able to spot her.



Even so, she caused great trouble for Levin—he found that the witch's imitated voices were elusive and did not need to come from her mouth. Sometimes they were on the left, sometimes on the right, and even sometimes came from behind his head. The content varied as well, such as imitating his own accent to issue orders or the agonizing cries of a militiaman.



But just as they were about to surround and capture her, the white-robed woman appeared again.



Levin revisited the shocking scene where Rayman Hoss was killed in the blink of an eye right before him.



He held a silver-white "light crossbow" in his hand. With every spark and boom, someone would fall.

The encircling pocket was torn apart in an instant, and everyone became like startled birds. Armor could not defend, shields were useless, and the iron round shield in Levin's hand was shattered to half. The pinholes leaking light on the iron told him how astonishing the power of the enemy's weapon was. The only thing that could compare with it was probably the double-handed crossbow. If it weren't for his subconscious ducking, he might have become a corpse by now.



But a heavy crossbow couldn't fire continuously!



The white witch's ability to appear and disappear at will, combined with the terrifying weapon that didn't require reloading, made Levin realize he had no chance of winning. Once this realization took hold, his anger extinguished as quickly as if it had encountered a cold wind.



"Swallow the pill and kill her when she appears!"



While shouting this, Levin himself retreated, running towards the edge of the forest when she focused her attention on the militiamen.

It was safer to stay with the main force of troops; she would never dare to attack him amidst a crowd!



The forest was also eerily dense, the thick wild grass nearly above the knees, with vines strewn all over the ground, ready to trip anyone not careful. Stumbling and crashing through the woods, Levin looked ahead, wanting to rendezvous with the main force, but the scene before him left him dumbfounded.



The effects of the potion had not yet worn off, but the militia was retreating... no, it would be more accurate to say they were fleeing. Those who ran slowly, or had not yet reacted, were tripped and trampled mercilessly by those behind them. They charged like galloping horses and fled the same way, kicking up clouds of dust so thick that Levin dared not step forward to stop them.



What on earth had happened? Levin stood frozen in disbelief. Could it be that in such a short amount of time, all fifteen hundred men had completely collapsed? And this was after they had taken the pills! Were the prince's subordinates all monsters?



At that moment, the sound of someone treading on weeds came from behind him. Gritting his teeth, he drew his sword and thrust backward with all his might—at the brink of life and death, this thrust was even quicker than usual, like a bolt of lightning. But instead of meeting flesh, he was met with a blinding flash of light. His sword shattered upon striking something, sparks flying in all directions, followed by a sharp pain in his right hand as the sensation in his fingertips vanished in an instant.



It was only when Levin's gaze fell upon his arm that he realized half of it was gone, the red and white flesh and bone exposed like the blossoming of a snakegrass flower. The woman in white approached him without any expression, and he couldn't help but stumble backward several steps in panic, tripping over himself and falling to the ground.



The witch stepped on his shoulder, the cold weapon pressing against his forehead. From this angle, Levin could see the face hidden beneath her hood.



So... beautiful.



That was his last thought before the sound of gunfire.
