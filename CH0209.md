## Convenience Market
"Stop!" May shouted to stop Irene, who pretended to stab down with the dagger, "Your expression doesn't need to be so fierce. Although he is an utterly despicable scum, he is still the adoptive father of the character you're playing. So you should show hesitation mixed with determination, and a peaceful demeanor of relief when you finally make your move. Let's try it again."

"Yes!" Irene responded earnestly.



More than half a month had passed since the first performance in the town, and she didn't know why she hadn't left yet, but instead had joined the troupe for the performance of a second play. Now, the troupe was rehearsing the third play, "The Witch's Diary." Just reading the script, it was clear that this drama was destined to be incomparable. For the first time, she witnessed such a fascinating and twist-filled story that completely abandoned the love of princes and princesses, the conspiracies of court rebels, and instead celebrated the courage, friendship, and faith of ordinary people and witches... Even after reading the entire script, she couldn't help but cheer for the characters in the story.



That was also the reason May claimed as to why she temporarily stayed behind.



But the real reason, she herself wasn't clear.



Irene thrust the prop dagger fiercely, and Sam, who played the adoptive father, let out a wail, "You actually..." Then his head tilted to the side, pretending to have breathed his last.



A bit exaggerated, May shook her head, "The spot where you stabbed is the heart. You wouldn't have the time to cry out in agony and then continue speaking. Just raise your hand as if trying to grab Irene, and then collapse. That's the most common portrayal of a fatal injury. Didn't you listen to anything in drama class?"



Sam's cheeks couldn't help but turn red: "I'm... I'm sorry."



"Let's go again," she said expressionlessly.



Irene's performance was somewhat beyond May's expectation, as many details were quickly corrected after just a single mention. Whether in terms of her dedication to the drama or her natural acting talent, Irene was among the top tier. It seemed that the title of "Star of the Western Region" was not just a result of mutual flattery among the lower-ranked actors.



"That was good, let's stop here for today," May clapped her hands when the content of the scene was finally expressed smoothly, "Philip Hilt should be finishing his class soon, right? You all should go home and prepare dinner. After all, that what's it called... water..."



"Tap water," Irene corrected with a smile.



"Uh, the tap water supply is replenished once before dusk, and if you eat too late, there will be no water for a bath," May coughed twice.



"Miss May, it's mainly because the knight is coming to pick you up, right?" Rosia covered her mouth and giggled, "It's still at least half an hour before evening."



"I heard that Sir Carter is a confidant of His Highness the Prince and often enters and exits the castle, staying by His Highness's side," Tilly also chimed in, "Ah... it's no wonder the most dazzling star of the Western Region is so noticeable wherever she goes."



"Enough already," Irene waved her hand, "Miss May may not necessarily accept Sir Carter."



"..." May raised her eyebrows, perhaps because she had not been acting as stern lately? At first, these two didn't even dare to breathe too loudly in her presence, but now they seemed to dare to joke around. It looked like she would have to give them a hard time during the rehearsals in the coming days; otherwise, with their current level, they were hardly fit to share the stage with her, "I'm leaving first."



"Thank you for your guidance!" Irene and a group of people bowed in thanks.

Originally, only a drama instructor would be entitled to such a courtesy, but May didn't mind. She nodded her head, left the rehearsal room, and immediately felt the sweltering air envelop her as she stepped outside.

She sat down in the shade of the trees at the center of the neighborhood for a while, when a tall man quickly approached her.

It was Carter Lannis, the Chief Knight of Border Town's lord.

"Sorry to keep you waiting," he said, scratching the back of his head.

"Not long," May said with a light smile, "Let's go."

Since the last time he took the initiative to invite her and was rejected, he not only didn't give up, but also persistently paid visits, which was completely at odds with the pride and aloofness his appearance suggested. And she, somehow or other, ended up being detained by him. May was very clear about his intentions, but the thought of settling down in this unfamiliar land filled her with confusion and apprehension.

Even when she first decided to come to see the Dawn, she hadn't planned to live here for long.

In the stronghold, she was a star actress adored by everyone, but here, she was no different from the other members of the troupe, and her fame was even less than Irene's, who had served as a teacher for the townspeople.



Walking through the wide streets shaded by trees, the two of them headed on foot towards the convenience market in the center of the town.

This town changed its appearance almost weekly. Last week, the area outside the district was bare, but now it was lush with greenery. As long as it didn't rain, construction was almost a daily occurrence here, with roads and houses being built, and more often than not, both were happening simultaneously. Such a bustling scene was a rare sight even in the capital.

The convenience market was located to the north of the square, split into two areas, separated by a row of plane trees. To the right was the budget area, similar to a market layout, open on all sides to the streets with wooden canopies overhead. The goods sold here were practical ironware and agricultural products: tools, hammers, drill bits, and nails for the former, and eggs, beef, grapes, and some unnameable foods for the latter. These goods were sorted and displayed at different stalls, each with someone to look after them.

To the left was the boutique area, much smaller in size and surrounded by brick walls, more like a bungalow. The merchandise inside was diverse and pricier, so there were far fewer people. On her second day in town, she was dragged around by Irene for a look. If not for the Chief Knight mentioning that there would be rare new goods on sale today, she would have preferred to grab a couple of cold beers at the tavern.

After registering, the two entered the boutique area. The method of sale here was also quite peculiar; the market only had one entrance and exit, with goods laid out on shelves for self-selection. Haggling was not accepted, nor was there anyone to boast or push sales. The prices and product descriptions were all written on parchment and posted on the side. You simply picked out what you liked and paid at the entrance.

May noticed that there were still about a dozen colorful cups left on the first row of shelves, with the same patterns she had seen on her last visit, indicating that these cups hadn't sold out in almost a month. If it were an ordinary merchant, they would definitely have made a loss by now.

"Is this market really opened by His Highness?" she asked.

"That's right," Carter nodded, "which is why you can see some incredible goods." He walked towards the third row of shelves, "Like this, for instance."

"This... is this the rare new product you mentioned?" May followed him to the side of the knight, only to see five or six light yellow blocks on the shelf, each about the size of a palm, and it was hard to tell what they were used for at a glance.



"This is something His Highness himself tried making. Now all the witchesâ€”*cough*, I mean the maids and the Royal Guards in the castle are using it. When used for bathing, it can easily remove the stubborn grease and leave you feeling completely refreshed afterward. Plus, it leaves a rose fragrance on your skin. I swear, there's nothing more miraculous than this when taking a shower," the Chief Knight declared with utter conviction.

May glanced at the sheepskin parchment attached to the side, which was marked with a string of newly coined words: soap.
