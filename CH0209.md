## Convenience Market
"Stop!" May shouted at Irene, who was pretending to plunge her dagger, "Your expression doesn't need to be so fierce. Although he is a despicable scoundrel, he is still the adoptive father of the character you're playing. So you should hesitate with determination, and when you finally deliver the blow, your demeanor should convey a sense of relief and peace. Let's do it again."

"Yes!" Irene replied earnestly.

More than half a month had passed since the first performance in the town, and she didn't know why she hadn't left yet, but instead, she had joined the performance of a second play. Now, the troupe was rehearsing the third part, "Diary of a Witch." Judging from the script alone, this play was destined to be incomparable. It was the first time she had seen such an exciting and convoluted story, completely abandoning the love between princes and princesses, the conspiracies of court rebels, and instead celebrating the courage, friendship, and faith of ordinary people and witches... Even after reading the entire script, she couldn't help but cheer for the characters in the story.

This was also the reason May claimed she was staying for the time being.

But the real reason, she wasn't sure about herself.

Irene thrust the prop dagger fiercely, and Sam, who was playing the adoptive father, let out a pitiful cry, "You actually..." Then his head lolled to the side, feigning death.

A tad exaggerated, May shook her head, "The spot you stabbed is the heart. He wouldn't have time to cry out in pain and then speak. Just raise your hand as if trying to grab Irene, then go limp. This is the most common response to a fatal injury in acting. Didn't you learn anything in drama class?"

Sam's cheeks flushed with embarrassment: "I... I'm sorry."



"Once more," she said expressionlessly.



However, Irene's performance was somewhat beyond May's expectations. Many of the detailed issues could be corrected swiftly after being pointed out just once. Whether it was her serious attitude toward drama or her natural talent for performance, she was among the top tier. It seemed that the title of "Star of the Theater" wasn't entirely a result of the low-ranking actors flattering each other.



"That was good. Let's stop here for today," said May, clapping her hands, after the content of the scene could finally be expressed smoothly. "Ferlin Eltek should be finishing his teaching soon, right? You all should also go home and prepare dinner. After all, that something water..."



"Tap water," Irene corrected with a smile.



"Er, tap water will be replenished once before dusk. If you eat too late, there will be no water for a bath," May coughed twice.



"Miss May, it's mainly because the knight is coming to pick you up, isn't it?" Rosia giggled behind her hand. "There's still at least half an hour until evening."



"It's said that Lord Carter is Prince Roland's confidant, frequently entering and exiting the castle, always by His Highness's side," Tina also chimed in excitedly. "Ah, it's no wonder—the brightest star of the Western Region is so eye-catching wherever she goes."



"That's enough from you all," Irene waved her hand. "Miss May might not even accept Lord Carter."



May raised an eyebrow, perhaps because she had been less strict lately? At first, these two wouldn't dare to breathe too loudly in front of her, and now they even dared to joke around. It seemed she would have to make the next few days of rehearsal a bit tougher for them. Otherwise, with this level of performance, they really weren't fit to share the stage with her. "I'm leaving first."



"Thank you for your guidance!" Irene and a group of people bowed their heads in thanks.

Originally, only a drama instructor would be entitled to such a courtesy, but May didn't mind. She nodded her head and left the rehearsal room, instantly enveloped by the scorching air outside.

She sat under the shade of a tree in the center of the district for a while when a tall man approached her quickly.

It was none other than Carter Lannis, the Chief Knight of Border Town's lord.

"Sorry to keep you waiting," he said, scratching the back of his head.

"Not for long," May smiled faintly, "Let's go."

Since the last time he had taken the initiative to invite her and was refused, he not only didn't give up but instead persistently visited her, which was completely at odds with the proud and aloof demeanor he exhibited. And just like that, she found herself inexplicably retained by him. May was very clear about his intentions, but when she thought about settling down in this unfamiliar land, she felt a sense of confusion and fear.

Even when she first decided to meet with the Dawnlight, she had not intended to live here with him for long.

In the fortress, she was a star-studded theater celebrity, but here, she was no different from the other members of the troupe, and her fame was even less than that of Irene, who had served as a teacher for the townsfolk.



Walking through the wide streets shaded by trees, the two of them headed on foot to the convenience market at the center of the town.

The town practically changed its appearance every week. Just last week, the area outside the neighborhood was bare, but now it's lush and green. As long as it doesn't rain, there is almost daily construction here, if not roads then houses, and more often than not, both are done simultaneously. Such a bustling scene is hard to come by even in the capital.

The convenience market is located to the north of the square, divided into two areas, separated by a row of plane trees. To the right is the affordable section, similar to a market layout, open to the streets on all sides, with a wooden canopy overhead. Inside, some economical ironware and agricultural products are sold: the former includes farm tools, hammers, drill bits, and nails, while the latter consists of eggs, beef, grapes, and some unnamable foods. These goods are sorted and placed in various stalls, each manned by a dedicated person.

To the left is the boutique section, much smaller in size, surrounded by brick walls, and more akin to a bungalow. The merchandise inside is diverse and more expensive, hence there are far fewer people. On her second day in town, she was dragged through it once by Irene. If it weren't for the Chief Knight saying that there were rare new goods for sale today, she would have preferred to go to the tavern for a couple of chilled barley beers.

After registering their identities, the two entered the boutique area. The selling method here was also quite peculiar; the market had only one entrance and exit, with goods placed on the shelves for self-selection. Haggling was not accepted, nor was there anyone to tout or promote, with prices and product descriptions written on parchment and posted to the side. You simply picked out the items you liked and went to the entrance to pay.

May noticed that there were still about a dozen colorful cups left on the first row of shelves, with the same patterns as what she saw during her last visit, indicating that these cups had not been sold out in almost a month's time. If it were a common merchant, they would have definitely been at a loss by now.

"Is this market really opened by His Highness?" she asked.

"Yes," Carter nodded, "That's why you can see some unbelievable merchandise." He walked towards the third row of shelves, "Like this, for example."

"Is this... the rare new product you were talking about?" May followed the knight's side, only to see five or six pale yellow blocks on the shelf, each about the size of a palm, and it wasn't immediately obvious what they were used for.



"This is something His Highness himself experimented with making, and now all the witches—cough, I mean the attendants and personal guards in the castle—are using it. It's especially good for baths; it can easily remove the stubborn grease and gives a completely refreshing feeling afterward. It even leaves a rose fragrance on the skin. I swear, there's nothing more miraculous than this when taking a shower," the Chief Knight declared earnestly.



Mei gazed at the parchment attached to the side, which was marked with a string of made-up words: Soap.
