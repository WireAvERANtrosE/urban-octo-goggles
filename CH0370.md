## Rhythm
Three days later, Roland received a definite answer from the eldest son of the Golden Lotus.



"I am willing to continue to serve you, and the Golden Lotus family will do the same," he bowed and said, "I will persuade my father; he and a few other major families... are quite different."



"Is that so," Roland suddenly felt pleased, "That would be best."



"These days, I have witnessed the astonishing changes in your territory... Perhaps, this is the city I have been hoping for," Petro said bluntly, "If we can make the Golden Lotus as prosperous, I believe my father wouldn't mind integrating the family with the New City."



This statement slightly moved the prince. His original intention in calling the other party over was only due to two reasons: one was that explaining such significant events in person seemed more sincere, and the other was to observe his attitude towards the orders. He hadn't expected it to have this effect. He nodded, "Of course, given time, every piece of land in Greycastle will become a comfortable dwelling for the people."



"Then I will set off back to the fortress as soon as possible and tell my father the news."



"And the other four major families, as well as all the nobles of the Western Region," Roland added, "Any family willing to accept these terms, the New City will welcome them without holding any past grudges. You can hold a banquet in the fortress castle and spread my words."



"You mean, let me announce it to them?" Petro was taken aback.



"That's right," the prince smiled, "This time... you will act as my ambassador, Mr. Petro."



"As you command, Your Highness," the eldest son of the Jasmines bowed with his hand on his chest.



As he was about to leave, Roland called out to him, "By the way, you've handled the witch matter very well, and there is no longer a need to hide it. With the popularization of education up to this point, those who are still deluded and hold expectations for the Church can all be removed from the Western Region. You decide how to proceed."



"Yes."



After Petrov Hull left, Roland stretched lazily and continued to review the summaries of various projects compiled by the City Hall.



Affected by the heavy snow, construction on the Kingdom Main Street had already been halted, and the construction of residential buildings was also slowing down, mainly limited to some interior decoration work. Fortunately, the batch of earth caves built before Lily left had basically met the needs of the subsequent refugees. Even if the number of refugees continued to increase, they only needed to cram more people into each cave—this was exactly the advantage of the communal heated beds.



According to the Construction Department, at least sixty percent of the workers were currently idle, which made some of the temporary recruitment posted by the City Hall very popular, such as clearing the snow from the streets, transporting ore in the blast furnace area, and so on. In other cities, it would be incredible to see so many people eager to work during the Evil Months, as winter was the hardest time for commoners, who would normally stay at home, relying on the food stored from autumn to survive. However, in Roland's eyes, seeing so much labor idle always felt like a waste, and he pondered that perhaps he should do something to make full use of them.



After all, the Margrave Chamber of Commerce had taken away the last batch of steam engines for the year, and the City Hall had ample money and food. He had plenty of plans that could be implemented.



Thinking this, Roland had his personal guards call for the Minister of Construction, Karl Van Bate.



After communicating his ideas, Karl couldn't help but widen his eyes in surprise, "You want the stonemasons and mud artisans to build ships for you?"



He nodded and said with all seriousness, "Yes, the location will be set up near the docks, where a temporary workshop will be constructed out of wood. We'll light a brazier inside to ensure the temperature is maintained, and once built, it can be pushed directly into the water."

"But Your Highness, how could they possibly know how to make such a thing?"

"Of course they will, just like when we built the Witch Building," Roland took out a piece of paper and drew a diagram to illustrate. "Set up the formwork, lay the rebar, pour in the concrete... I will guide you on how to build the first ship, and for the subsequent ones, you will be responsible for overseeing. This way, we can also make full use of all the workers."

Karl looked at the sketch with confusion, "Is this... a basin?"

He couldn't help but curl the corner of his mouth, "Exactly, a giant concrete basin."

Since Karl hadn't been involved in the construction of the Towntalker, it wasn't surprising that he had such thoughts. In fact, ships have gone through numerous changes in form throughout their long development, with little to no inheritance between the different types. Roland would be clueless about designing a classical wooden ship with a keel, but constructing a concrete ship fundamentally wasn't much different from shaping a model out of clay—as long as it could float. The same was true for steel ships. With advancements in welding technology, most modern ships have abandoned the practice of laying down a keel. Instead, they are constructed from sections of steel boxes pieced together, with the bottom plate bearing the load, eliminating the need to master the method of building wooden ships beforehand.

Regarding the new batch of concrete ships, he had given it a lot of thought—whether it was for mining coal resources near the Snow Mountain or transporting refugees, a fleet of inland vessels with higher load capacity was needed, so the low draft flat-bottom design was still the most appropriate choice. Compared to the conservatively designed Towntalker, the new ships could be longer, improving speed while ensuring load capacity and stability. To reduce construction difficulty, Roland ultimately decided to stick with the paddle wheel propulsion system, which had already been tested on wooden ships and was easier for the craftsmen to handle.

"Your Highness, how many workers do you plan to commit to building these... concrete ships?" Karl asked somewhat awkwardly.

"Gather all the idle workers, just like when we build residential buildings. We can start on several ships at once."



With this arrangement, the newly assembled steam engines from the factory could find use even if they were not sold. The kiln area could also continue producing cement without stopping, achieving multiple benefits in one stroke. By next year, if we could have a large fleet of cement boats, the First Army would have reliable logistical support no matter where they attacked.



After handling this matter, Roland planned to visit the castle's back garden.



The olive trees and grapevines planted there provided shelter from the wind and snow. If the witches had no tasks at hand, they usually practiced their abilities in the garden, and Paper, the newcomer, should be no exception.



According to Wendy's report, her ability was neither like controlling temperature nor like material restoration. Apart from water, her effect on other objects was minimal, which made Roland quite curious. Three days had passed, and the young girl should no longer be as timid and shy as when she first arrived. It would be good to go and observe for himself.



Upon entering the garden, Roland immediately sensed something strange.



Within his field of vision, everything was lush and green, as if completely isolated from the snowy world outside—the olive trees were evergreen, and their branches were entwined with vines. It was not strange that snowflakes couldn't drift in, but these plants seemed too vibrant. Unlike the silent woods, there was no cold wind, yet every blade of grass gently swayed with a neat and rhythmic motion.



He initially thought it was an illusion, but as he walked further in, the branches of the olive trees drooped down as if bowing their heads to him, and the grass at his feet leaned to one side as if welcoming his arrival.



This sensation gave Roland the creeps, goosebumps rose on his back, and he felt as though he wasn't walking through a garden but moving inside the body of some gigantic creature.



The entire garden seemed to be breathing.
