## Annihilation
Grace experienced the terror of a transcendent for the first time.

Her weapon was merely an ordinary single-handed sword, but with each movement, it unleashed an oppressive force that struck the soul. Every blow on the shield was as heavy as a two-handed greatsword, and after a few hits, Grace's arms could no longer be lifted. Then, an upward strike shattered her jaw.

After recovering, Queen Clearwater completely abandoned defense. In an instant, a crossbow bed appeared in front of her. She pulled the trigger, not firing iron spears but several jars of Netherwater. Gerald swung her sword to knock down the jars, only to get drenched in the black water. The evil fire crystals soaked in the jars reacted with the air, rapidly smoking and burning, turning the Purifier into a pillar of fire.

However, the next move was futile. The opponent used their superhuman speed to move rapidly around the flower pool, and the crossbow bed couldn't turn fast enough. Grace had to rely on raising stone walls and iron railings full of spikes to stop the Purifier's movements, turning the flower pots in the garden into explosives filled with snow powder. Sometimes, the ground would suddenly cave in, forming deadly traps.

After killing the opponent several times, Grace found her breathing becoming increasingly heavy, large beads of sweat sliding down her forehead, and waves of dizziness in her mind almost causing her to lose her balance.

"Well done," the reborn Gerald did not take the opportunity to attack but clapped her hands instead, "You've surprised me by getting this far, but I forgot to tell you, although in this world you can change the environment and terrain with your consciousness, it consumes more energy than creating things out of thin air... even comparable to resurrection. You should feel the weakness and fatigue of your body, and perhaps the next time you die, it will be an eternal slumber."

"Ha, that's still better than being slaughtered without a fight," Grace gasped for air, "And you seem to have forgotten the screams you made when you were burned by the evil fire. How many times did you die this round? Three times, or four? I don't think you'll last longer than me."

Gerald was silent for a moment before speaking, "Since I became a Purifier, the Church has made many preparations for me, from gaining knowledge, learning combat skills, to feeding me Judgement Army to enhance my abilities. Those Judgement Warriors knew they would sacrifice themselves, yet they willingly stepped into the soul battlefield. In the world of consciousness, they honed my skills through life-and-death battles, then peacefully accepted death, passing on their insights and experiences to me."

Grace didn't interrupt her; perhaps the other side was stalling for time, but she indeed needed a moment to rest.



"I have also devoured an Extraordinary, whose power was fearsome—in the battle of souls, I nearly faced defeat, but in the end, I relied on the devil's weapon to overcome her and acquired everything she had. Due to the different nature of magical power, I couldn't truly transform into an Extraordinary or wield the abilities of other devoured witches, but in the world of consciousness, these are not difficult tasks. After that, few could threaten me, and over two hundred years, I have devoured so many that I can hardly keep count. Every pain, joy, sorrow, and pleasure of this world I have experienced as if they were my own…" She paused, "And that includes death as well."

"What are you trying to say?" Grace frowned.

"The gap between you and me," Zero replied calmly, "The accumulation of numerous souls has made my will incredibly strong. If measured by the number of deaths, I believe I could withstand death hundreds of times."

"I'll be sure to verify that thoroughly." She sneered coldly, but her heart sank… The other's demeanor did not seem to be a bluff, as could be seen from the swift and clean killings of the guards at the dock; the Pure Witch indeed possessed combat skills that belied her age. If that were true, she would need a much stronger weapon... She quickly pondered, what could easily kill an experienced Extraordinary witch?

"The battle of souls is not a contest of imagination," Zero said as if seeing through her thoughts, "You can't make yourself impervious to weapons out of thin air, nor can you summon those world-destroying weapons from ancient legends... You can't create what you haven't experienced; what you see and know is the key to victory."

"I'll cover the entire garden with fierce Blasting Snow Powder, so you won't be able to avoid it," Grace said coldly, "Even if it means death, at least I'll drag you down with me!"

"Even if the outcome is meaningless?" The Pure Witch looked at her with pity, "If that's the case, then let me show you the true power of the Church."

Red lights appeared behind Zero, then condensed into a war chariot with a ferocious appearance. They were so enormous that they directly crushed the garden's surrounding walls. The two metal spears extending from the top reminded Grace of the Wolf King's guard's report—a kind of never-before-seen crossbow was attacking the city walls, with unprecedented range and power. Could that guard have been referring to this behemoth before her eyes?

Then she heard a buzzing sound.



The robust spear shaft directly overcame the layers of barriers set by Grace, effortlessly tearing her in half. As her body flew backward, she could still see her own scattered organs and blood.

The war machines fired unstoppable spears one after another, quickly repeating the same death after recovery. She didn't even have time to create explosive snow powder to perish together with the enemy. The continuous intense pain blurred her consciousness, the ground began to tremble, and cracks appeared in the sky. Amidst the thunder and lightning, the garden was engulfed in raging flames.

"Strong will can only delay defeat, but it cannot change the outcome," said Jelo as she closed her eyes. "You have held on long enough, now rest in peace."

As her words fell, the whole world shattered.

...

"Is it over?" Isabella pouted. "Shouldn't it have been completed instantly? You've already returned to your original form, but you haven't said a word for so long... I thought you really failed."

"In her memory, I found some interesting things," Jelo opened her eyes. "These thoughts... they make me feel somewhat sentimental."

"Oh? Something that can actually make you feel sentimental?" Isabella said casually. "That strange alchemical powder, you found it, right?"

"Yes, the alchemists call it 'explosive snow powder.' Its composition is quite simple, all common materials found in the workshop."



"That will do, hurry back to the Holy City and report to His Majesty Oberlain," she exhaled, "The battle here will last at least another three or four days, but without their leader and the witches, the remnants no longer pose a threat to the God's Punishment Army."

"Let's go," Jelo nodded.

"Wait..." Isabella called out to her.

"What is it?"

Was it an illusion? She looked unchanged from before, yet why did it feel like there was something different about those light red eyes? Isabella scrutinized her carefully for a moment, then shook her head, "No... it's nothing."

Perhaps it was just her own imagination.
