## Annihilation
Grace experienced the terror of a Transcendent for the first time.



Her weapon was merely an ordinary one-handed sword, but with each movement, it unleashed a soul-crushing oppressive force. Each strike on the shield felt as heavy as a two-handed greatsword, and after a few hits, Grace could no longer lift her arms. She was then struck by an upward swing that shattered her jaw.



After recovering, Queen Clearwater completely abandoned defense. In a moment, a crossbow appeared before her. She pulled the trigger, but instead of iron spears, she shot out several jars of Netherwater. Ashes swung her sword to shatter the jars but was drenched by the black water. The evil fire crystals soaked within the jars reacted with the air, rapidly smoking and burning, turning the Purifier into a pillar of fire.



However, this tactic would not work again as the opponent used her superhuman speed to move quickly around the flower pond, and the crossbow simply couldn't turn in time. Grace had to rely on raising stone walls and iron railings filled with spikes to stop the Purifier's movements. She transformed the flower pots scattered in the garden into explosives filled with snow powder, and sometimes the ground would suddenly collapse, forming deadly traps.



After killing her opponent several times like this, Grace realized that her breathing had gradually become heavy, large beads of sweat fell from her forehead, and the dizziness attacking her mind almost made her unable to stand.



"Well done," Ashes, having been revived, did not take the opportunity to attack but clapped her hands instead, "It's beyond my expectations that you've managed this much. But I forgot to tell you, even though in this world you can change the environment and terrain with your consciousness, it consumes far more energy than creating something out of nothing... almost as much as revival. You should feel the weakness and fatigue of your body. Maybe the next time you die, it will be an eternal sleep."



"Ha, it's still better than being slaughtered without a fight," Grace gasped for breath, "And you seem to have forgotten the screams you made when you were burned by the evil fire. How many times have you died this round? Three times, or four? I don't think you'll last longer than me."



Ashes was silent for a moment before speaking, "Ever since I became a Purifier, the Church has made many preparations for me, from gaining knowledge and learning combat skills to feeding me Judgment Army soldiers to enhance my abilities. Those Judgment Warriors knew they would sacrifice themselves, yet they still willingly entered the soul battlefield. In the realm of consciousness, they honed my skills through fights to the death, and then peacefully accepted their demise, passing their insights and experiences on to me."



Grace did not interrupt her; perhaps the opponent was stalling for time, but she indeed needed a moment to rest.



"I have even devoured an Extraordinary; her power was terrifying—I almost lost in the battle of souls, but in the end, I overcame her with the devil's weapon and gained everything from her. Due to the different nature of magic, I cannot truly become an Extraordinary, nor can I use the abilities of other witches I have devoured, but in the world of consciousness, these are not difficult tasks. After that, very few could threaten me, and in over two hundred years, I have devoured so many people that even I cannot clearly remember. I have experienced all the pain, joy, sorrow, and pleasure of this world..." She paused, "including death itself."



"What exactly are you trying to say?" Grace frowned.



"The gap between you and me," Zero replied calmly, "the accumulation of numerous souls has made my will incredibly strong. If measured by the number of deaths, I believe I could withstand at least a hundred."



"I'll be sure to verify that for you." She sneered twice, but her heart sank... The other's demeanor did not seem like a bluff; it was evident from the way she killed the guards cleanly and efficiently at the dock that the Pure Witch indeed possessed combat skills that did not match her age. If this was true, she had to acquire a more powerful weapon... Quick, think, what could easily kill an experienced Extraordinary witch?



"The battle of the soul is not a contest of imagination," Zero said, as if seeing through her thoughts, "You cannot make yourself invulnerable out of nowhere, nor can you summon those world-destroying weapons from ancient legends... You cannot create what you have never experienced, what you see and know is the key to victory."



"I will cover the entire garden with fierce snow powder, so you won't be able to avoid it," Grace said coldly, "Even if I die, I'll take you with me!"



"Even if the result is meaningless?" The Pure Witch looked at her with pity, "If that's the case, then let me show you the true power of the Church."



Red lights appeared behind Zero, then condensed into a ferocious and terrifying war machine. Their size was so immense that they directly crushed the garden walls. The two metal spears protruding from the top reminded Grace of the Wolf King's guards' report—a never-before-seen type of crossbow was attacking the city walls, with unprecedented range and power. Could it be that what the guards described was this behemoth before her?



Then she heard a buzzing sound.



The robust spear shaft directly breached the multiple barriers set up by Grace, tearing her in half effortlessly, and as her body flew backward, she could still see her own organs and blood scattering.

The war machine launched unstoppable long spears one after another, quickly resetting and repeating the same demise. She didn't even have time to create explosive snow powder to perish together with the enemy. The continuous pain blurred her consciousness; the ground began to tremble, cracks appeared in the sky, and amidst the flashes of lightning and thunder, the garden was engulfed in raging flames.

"A strong will can only delay defeat, but it cannot change the outcome," said Jeluo, closing her eyes. "You have persisted long enough; rest well."

As her voice faded, the entire world shattered.

...

"Is it over?" Isabella pouted. "Wasn't it supposed to be instant? You've already reverted to your original form, yet you didn't say a word for so long... I thought you really failed."

"In her memories, I found some interesting things," Jeluo opened her eyes. "These ideas... make me feel somewhat sentimental."

"Oh? There's actually something that can make you feel sentimental?" Isabella said casually. "Did you find that strange alchemical powder?"

"Yes, the alchemists call it explosive snow powder, its composition is quite simple, all common items found in the workshop."



"That's good, hurry back to the Holy City and report to His Excellency, Oberon Lion," she exhaled, "The battle here will last at least another three or four days, but without their leader and the witches, the remnants no longer pose a threat to the God's Punishment Army."

"Let's go," Gerald nodded.

"Wait..." Isabella stopped her.

"What is it?"

Was it an illusion? She looked exactly the same as before, but why did Isabella always feel that there was something different in those light red eyes? Isabella scrutinized her for a moment and then shook her head, "No... It's nothing."

Probably just overthinking it.
