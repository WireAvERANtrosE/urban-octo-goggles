## Kiss
In the evening, Roland sat in his office and began to conceive new equipment.
The pills that appeared at Clearwater Harbor gave him a strong sense of crisis. Setting aside why the Church was supporting both him and Grace in the contest for the throne, just the thought of the thousands of troops at Grace's command made his scalp tingle.
Imagine thousands of steel warriors running at the speed of cavalry, charging toward him with an unstoppable momentum. The thin line of musketeers would hardly be able to stop them. Just one man breaking through the ranks could cause devastating losses to the First Army.
Fortunately, these pills did not provide immunity to damage; those who took them were still flesh and blood.
He needed weapons with a higher rate of fire and accuracy, capable of continuous fire at greater distances.
Without mercury fulminate for primers, Roland had to find a way around this obstacle and produce a batch of alternative equipment to prepare for a potential crisis.
Anna's new ability gave him great confidence. Now, as long as he could draw the design, Anna could precisely manufacture it with astonishing efficiency—rather than relying on blacksmiths to hammer out flintlock gun parts, she could now stack several plates together and cut them into shape simultaneously.
Universal education and standardized measurements were preparations for industrial-scale production, but it did not mean he would ignore shortcuts. Anna's new ability was like a treasure trove with endless potential to be tapped. Nowadays, Roland would go to North Slope Mountain every afternoon to study the application of blackfire with her. If he really couldn't spare the time, he would have her practice her control by carving small trinkets—such as figurines of witches.
Although her current skill in sculpting people was still quite childlike, Roland believed that one day, his bookcase display would be filled with colorful figurines of witches... probably?

He picked out a steel ruler and pressed it onto the parchment paper, and had only drawn two strokes when there was a knock at the door.
If the guard didn't announce the visitor, then nine times out of ten, it was a witch. And at this moment, most of the witches were on the first floor in the parlor, learning to read and studying arithmetic with the scrolls, so the witch who had time to come to find him, and didn't need to attend basic education, could only be one person.
"Come in."
As expected, it was Anna who pushed the door and entered.
She gently closed the door, walked up to Roland's desk, and cradled a gold-edged book in her arms.
Being able to borrow her book of illusion, which she could only manifest once a day, before the scroll class, it had to be said that although Anna was not much of a talker, she was unexpectedly popular among the witches. Thinking of Nana, who used to stick to her like a little tail, perhaps she had a natural charm that attracted witches?
"What's the matter? Did you encounter a problem that's hard to understand?"
"Um," she nodded, spreading the book open in front of Roland, "Here... you said that everything in the world is made up of tiny spheres, and that these spheres are different from one another, but later you mentioned that they can turn into... waves?" Anna asked, "What are waves?"
"When you throw a stone into the water, the ripples it causes are waves," the prince coughed twice, "It's a concept, just look at it, there's no need to delve too deeply."

"Why?" 

Because I don't understand it myself, Roland thought with a mix of amusement and frustration. The realm of quantum mechanics is mysterious and profound; he regretted mentioning it. While he thought this, he couldn't say it out loud. "Because the particle exhibits both wave-like and particle-like properties. The same applies to us, who are made up of these particles. It's just that our mass is too large, making it difficult to observe our wave-like nature. As for the deeper reasons, it will take countless generations to explore," he pondered before adding, "Since this phenomenon greatly contradicts common sense, it's very difficult to comprehend, just like how we, living in a three-dimensional world, struggle to imagine a four-dimensional space. You shouldn't worry about it too much."

Anna pouted, seemingly unsatisfied with Roland's explanation, but soon she asked, "What is four-dimensional space?"

"..."

When she finally stopped asking questions, the prince was left talking until he was parched. He had truly underestimated Anna's thirst for knowledge. At this rate, he would soon have nothing left to teach her.

Especially when Roland inquired about her progress in mathematics, she answered with ease, "That's much simpler. I'm currently looking at equations and matrices, which are quite interesting."

Simpler, quite interesting... Roland suddenly felt the gap between people was immense. How long had it been? In just a week's time, she had moved from simple elementary functions to matrix equations, and calculus would be next. In school, Anna would definitely be a formidable top student.

And a very beautiful one at that.

Roland gazed at the woman absorbed in her book, momentarily lost in thought. Her delicate bangs rested on her forehead, with stray hairs naturally falling along her cheeks. He couldn't help but extend his index finger, twirling a lock of her hair gently behind her ear.

She turned her head to look at Roland, a smile in her eyes. Her lake-blue pupils were no longer still like calm water, but now rippled with waves. They gazed at each other from such a close distance until Anna opened her mouth to speak a sentence—without sound, just lip movements. Roland still deciphered her lip language.

"Nightingale is not here right now."

The meaning of her words couldn't be more straightforward, and Roland felt that it would be incredibly foolish of him not to understand. The room was silent; he could almost hear the other's breathing and heartbeat.

As he drew closer, Anna closed her eyes, a blush rising to her cheeks. Roland, smelling the faint fragrance coming from her, gently kissed her lips.

The soft sensation came through their touch, and time seemed to freeze at that moment, only separating after what felt like an eternity.

Before he could say anything, Anna tiptoed up to bring their lips together again.
...
"Eh—ha—hei!" Miya sat cross-legged on the bed, eyes closed in contemplation, hands raised high, murmuring to herself.

"What madness are you spouting?" Lily wrapped a towel around her wet hair and asked with a frown.

"I'm imagining myself as being made up of particles," she said, opening her eyes. "I am particles," then she reached out her hand towards Lily, "You are particles too!"
"Nonsense," the latter rolled her eyes and burrowed into the soft quilt.
"Sigh, it's no use." Miya sighed, "I've even thought of everything around me as composed of particles, so why can't I evolve new abilities like Anna?"
"Because you don't really believe," Lily said.
"I do believe!"
"You don't," she shook her head, "The one thing a person can't deceive is themselves... Although I'm not quite sure why, Anna probably believed unconditionally in what the prince said from the start. Of course, she's much smarter than you to begin with; that's also the key reason she was able to gain new abilities."
"..."
"Anyway, stop daydreaming and get some sleep," Lily spread her hands.
"Don't you wish you had such abilities?" Miya pouted, "I want to do more for the prince too."

"Evolve to make food stay fresh for longer?" She yawned, "Not interested. Besides, why should I do extra work for him? Men are fickle and heartless, Echo is the example right before your eyes."
"Say you're not interested, but you were clearly so focused during the class," Miya muttered quietly, "Aside from Leaves, you were the most serious one."
Lily grabbed a pillow and smacked it onto the other's face, "Go to sleep!"
