## Kiss
In the evening, Roland sat in his office and began to devise new equipment.

The appearance of the pills at Clearwater Harbor had given him a strong sense of crisis. Setting aside the reason why the Church was supporting both him and Grace in the struggle for the throne, the mere thought of the thousands of troops at Grace's disposal made his scalp tingle.

Imagine thousands of Iron Warriors running at the speed of cavalry, charging towards him with an unstoppable momentum. A thin line of muskets would hardly be able to stop them. If even one of them broke through the ranks, it would cause heavy casualties to the First Army.

Fortunately, the pills did not provide immunity to damage; those who took them were still flesh and blood.

He needed a weapon with higher rate of fire and precision, one that could fire continuously from a greater distance.

Without mercury fulminate for primers, Roland had to find a way to overcome this hurdle and produce a batch of alternative equipment to cope with a potential crisis.

Anna's new ability gave him great confidence. Now, as long as he could draw the design, Anna could machine it with high precision, and the efficiency was amazing. Compared to the previous method of forging flintlock gun components by hammering them out one by one, she could now stack several plates on top of each other and cut them out simultaneously.

Universal education and the standardization of measurements were preparations for industrial mass production, but that didn't mean he should ignore shortcuts. Anna's new ability was like a treasure trove, with endless potential to be tapped. Nowadays, Roland would go to Northern Slope Mountain every afternoon to work with her on the applications of Blackfire. If he really couldn't find the time, he would let her practice controlling her power by carving little trinkets—like witch figurines.

Although her current skill in carving figures was still quite immature, Roland believed that one day, his bookcase display would be filled with various witch figurine models... probably?



He selected a steel ruler and pressed it onto the parchment, but after only a couple of strokes, there was a knock at the door.

If the guard didn't announce the visitor, nine times out of ten, it would be a witch. And at this moment, most of the witches were in the parlor on the first floor, learning to read and calculate with scrolls, so the witch who had the time to come looking for him, and did not need to attend the basic education, could only be one person.

"Come in."

As expected, the one who pushed the door and entered was Anna.

She gently closed the door, walked to Roland's desk, holding a book with gold trim in her arms.

Having the ability to borrow her Manifestation Book, which she could only materialize once a day, before the scroll class, one had to say that although Anna was not very talkative, she had unexpectedly good relations within the witch community. Thinking of Nana, who used to stick to her like a little tail, perhaps she had a natural charm that attracted witches?

"What's the matter? Did you come across something difficult to understand?"

"Yes," she nodded, laying the book open in front of Roland, "Here... you said that everything in the world is made up of tiny spheres, and these spheres are all different. But later you mention that they can transform into... waves?" Anna inquired, "What are waves?"

"When you throw a stone into water, the ripples it causes are waves," the prince coughed twice, "It's a concept, just take a look at it, there's no need to delve too deeply."



"Why?" 



Because I don't understand it myself, Roland thought to himself with a wry smile. The field of quantum mechanics is inherently mysterious. If only I hadn't written about this in the first place. While thinking this, he couldn't say it out loud, "Because the little ball has the properties of a wave and also the properties of matter. We, who are made up of these little balls, are the same. It's just that our mass is too large, making it difficult to observe our wave-like nature. As for the deeper reasons behind this, it will take countless generations to explore." He thought for a moment, and then added, "Since this phenomenon greatly contradicts common sense, it is very difficult to understand, just like how we, who live in a three-dimensional world, find it hard to imagine a four-dimensional space. You don't have to worry about it."



Anna pouted, seemingly not quite satisfied with Roland's explanation, but she quickly asked again, "What is four-dimensional space?"



"..."



When she finally stopped asking, the prince was already parched from talking. He had seriously underestimated Anna's thirst for knowledge. At this rate, he wouldn't have anything left to teach her.



Especially when Roland inquired about her progress in mathematics, she answered with ease, "That's much simpler. I'm currently looking at equations and matrices, which are quite interesting."



Much simpler, quite interesting... Roland suddenly felt that the gap between people was just too vast. How long had it been? In just one week, she had gone from elementary functions to matrix equations, and soon she would be onto calculus. In school, Anna would definitely be a formidable top student.



And besides... she was a very beautiful top student.



Roland watched the woman who was flipping through the book, momentarily lost in thought. Her fine bangs rested on her forehead, with stray hairs naturally falling along her cheeks. He couldn't help but reach out with his index finger, lifting the stray hair, gently tucking it behind her ear.



She turned her head to look at Roland, her eyes brimming with a smile. The lake-blue pupils were no longer calm like still water, but now rippled gently. They gazed at each other closely, until Anna opened her mouth to say something—there was no sound, just the shape of her lips. Roland still made out her lip-reading.

"Nightingale is not here right now."

The meaning of the sentence couldn't be more straightforward, and Roland felt that it would be stupid not to understand. The room was silent, and he could almost hear the other's breathing and heartbeat.

As he drew closer, Anna closed her eyes, and a blush emerged on her cheeks. Roland, inhaling the faint fragrance emanating from her, gently kissed her lips.

The soft sensation was conveyed through their touch, and time seemed to freeze at that moment, not knowing how long had passed before they parted.

Before he could say anything, Anna stood on her toes and brought their lips together again.

...

"Eh—ha—hey!" Miya sat cross-legged on the bed, her eyes closed in contemplation, hands held high, muttering under her breath.

"What are you going crazy about?" Lily wrapped a towel around her damp hair and asked with a frown.



"I imagine myself as being made up of particles," she said with her eyes open, "I am particles," then she reached out towards Lily, "You are particles too!"

"Nonsense." The latter rolled her eyes and burrowed into the soft bedding.

"Ah, it's no use," Miya sighed, "I've thought of everything around me as being composed of particles, so why can't I evolve new abilities like Anna?"

"Because you don't really believe," Lily said.

"I do believe!"

"You don't," she shook her head, "The only person one can't deceive is oneself... Although I'm not quite sure of the reason, Anna probably believed unconditionally in what the prince said from the start. Of course, she's much smarter than you to begin with, and that's the key reason she was able to gain new abilities."

"..."

"Anyway, just stop fantasizing and get some sleep," Lily spread her hands.

"Don't you wish to have such abilities?" Miya pouted, "I also want to do more for the prince."



"Evolve to make food stay fresh for longer?" She yawned, "Not interested. Besides, why should I do extra work for him? Men are heartless and fickle, Echo is a prime example right in front of your eyes."

"Say you're not interested, but you were so focused during class." Miya muttered softly, "Apart from Leaf, you were the most serious one."

Lily grabbed a pillow and smacked it on the other's face, "Go to sleep!"
