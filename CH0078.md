## Accompaniment
Wendy opened her eyes to an unfamiliar ceiling. Wooden beams covered with cobwebs, a gray stone ceiling, and a ring-shaped chandelier that had never been lit entered her vision. The scene shifted from blurry to clear until every detail was revealed.



It wasn't the cold rock ceiling or the cramped tent, she thought. That's right, she had left the Mutual Aid Society more than half a month ago. She wondered if the Teacher had successfully led her sisters to the Holy Mountain.



She took a deep breath; although it wasn't as fresh and chilly as the cave's air, the stuffy warmth of the room made her feel equally comfortable. Her body was enveloped in a soft velvet quilt, with several layers of cotton blankets underneath. Even if she stretched out fully, her toes wouldn't poke out of the quilt.



The feeling of wanting to stay in bed and not get up made her feel a bit guilty. She had only been here for half a month, yet she was already feeling a long-lost sense of security.



In the castle, no matter how late she got up, no one disturbed her. For instance, now, as Wendy turned her head to look out the window, the gray-white sky was almost glaring. It was probably past the Fox Hour (10 a.m.), and during her years of drifting, there were few times she could sleep peacefully. Any slight noise would wake her from her dreams, and she had to start preparing food before dawn. When venturing outside, she constantly worried about being discovered by the Church; no one could guarantee survival through the next demonic bite.



Even if she had taken refuge in the Impassable Mountain Range, she should have been busy with chores, such as helping to air-dry food and herbs, blow-drying the sisters' snow-wet clothes, or cleaning the camp, and so on...



Wendy didn't mind doing these tasks; seeing everyone's smiles made her feel incredibly happy. But she found that she couldn't resist this lazy lifestyle either; instead, she was somewhat indulging in it.



No, she couldn't continue being lazy. She slapped her cheeks and gathered the strength to get out of bed. After all, when she was at the monastery, the Prioress often warned that lazy people would not receive the blessings of the Divine.



She would go to the back garden later to practice controlling the wind and incidentally blow the snow away. Thinking of Prince Roland's demands for practice, Wendy couldn't help but want to laugh. What strange requests they were—for example, after watching the demonstration of her abilities, he hoped she could blow the wind more than ten steps above her head. However, no witch had ever been able to extend their magic that far. When told it was impossible, he not only didn't get angry but came up with a quirky idea: have her stand on a stool and blow strong winds both above and below at the same time. Wendy tried it and found it to be a workable method. The test results satisfied Prince Roland. In addition to asking her to practice more in this way, he also inquired whether she had acrophobia.



Just as Nightingale said, Prince Roland Wimbledon is an unfathomable man, but he is also a prince who shows great care and affection for witches.

Thinking of this, Wendy sighed softly.

A prince who doesn't hate witches truly exists, Teacher, you were wrong.

Putting on new clothes, she felt a slight tightness in her chest—Wendy was used to this kind of thing by now, and just as she was about to find a needle and thread to make some alterations, there was a knock at the door.

"Come in."

The one who entered was Nightingale. Wendy was slightly startled, then smiled, "Has His Highness not gotten up yet? You actually have time to come see me."

"What are you talking about, I don't have the time to follow him around every day," Nightingale raised the basket in her hand, "I've brought you breakfast."

Usually, it was the maids who were responsible for delivering breakfast to the rooms. Other than when His Highness retired for the night and Nightingale would often come to keep her company, it was quite hard to see her at other times. Wendy smiled inwardly, having just woken up and running over with food, she must have slipped in to check on her a few times.

"Spit it out, what's the matter?" She took the basket, pinched out a piece of bread with cheese from inside, and put it in her mouth.



"Um..." Nightingale walked to the bedside and sat down, "Nana is going to go through... that day today."

Wendy was silent; although it was the first time for magical backlash, it wouldn't be as violent and lasting as on an adult day, but it still couldn't be said to be absolutely safe. The younger the age, the lower the tolerance for pain. She placed the basket on the bedside cabinet, walked over to Nightingale, and patted her shoulder, "Didn't His Highness say that as long as you maintain the release of magic every day, the torment can be minimized?"



"But that's just speculation."



"At least it sounds very reasonable," Wendy comforted, "Didn't Anna get through it just like that? Even on the toughest adult day, she didn't suffer any harm. You saw it with your own eyes." She paused, then asked, "What about Nana?"



"She's at the hospital right now," Nightingale couldn't help but smile as she spoke, "I heard that her father, Baron Pine, bought a large group of wild rabbits from the hunters, all of which have been sent to the hospital. He said she should practice until tomorrow."



"It's nice to have a father like that," Wendy sighed, "I can't remember the things from my childhood... It's strange, it's like there's a blank in my memory, no father, no mother, I've been in the monastery ever since I became aware of things."



"It seems I'm a bit luckier than you."



"Yes, quite a bit luckier." Wendy moved closer and sat down beside her, "Are you nervous?"



"..." Nightingale was silent for a moment, then gently nodded.



Wendy certainly knew what the other party was nervous about. Today was not only a crucial day for Nana but also a key turning point to reverse the fate of witches. If Nana could safely get through this backlash, it would mean that witches could completely escape the shadow of the devil's clutches, and Border Town would become the veritable "Holy Mountain"—a day would come when all witches would gather here, living a life no different from ordinary people, no longer needing to wander and evade the Church's hunt.



"Worrying won't help, we might as well take a lazy day off and go accompany Nana," she suggested.



"A lazy... day?" Nightingale widened her eyes as she looked towards Wendy.



"Yes, since you told me the news so early and made me nervous too," Wendy frankly said, "Since we're not in the mood to practice, let's go visit Nana. Isn't it written in the contract? This is called paid leave."



...



After dinner, Nana's room was already full of people—Anna, Lightning, Nightingale, Wendy, Titus, and Roland. Seeing this crowd, the little girl's face was full of conflict, "Uh... am I going to die?"



"Of course not!" everyone shook their heads together.



"It's just the first time; the backlash won't be very strong," Wendy held Nana's right hand, "Focus your mind, you can endure it."



"If it hurts, just pinch Daddy's hand," Titus said, shaking his daughter's left hand, "You've already become very strong at the medical clinic, Daddy is proud of you."



The little girl nodded, her gaze drifting past everyone before finally settling on Anna.

Anna stepped forward and kissed her on the forehead. "Survive, okay?"

"...Okay."
