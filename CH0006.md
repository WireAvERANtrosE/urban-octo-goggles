## Training (Part 1)
A shed had been added to the back garden of the castle, surrounded by wooden boards with only two holes left for windows.



In the center of the shed was a square pool built of bluestone bricks, about three meters in length and width, filled with sand. After adding the right amount of water, it was not only difficult to ignite but also had a certain plasticity, and with a small shovel, one could dig out the desired shape. On top of the sand were a few iron ingots—these were dragged over from the smithy by Carter Lannis.



Next to the pool was a well, and it was because of this that Roland had people set up the shed here.



However, as a laboratory, it was still too rudimentary. He shook his head; something cobbled together in one night could naturally not be ideal. And the official workshop had to wait until Barov finished collecting the information before they could choose a location to start construction.



"How did you sleep last night?" he asked, turning to face the bewildered Anna, with a smile.



The witch now looked completely different from when she was in the cell—after careful washing, her flaxen shoulder-length hair was smooth and lustrous, her skin, though not maintained, was young, and the light freckles on her nose added a touch of youthful vitality. Her figure was still slender, as if she could be pushed over easily, but her cheeks had a healthy color, and the bruises and marks on her neck had faded a lot compared to the day before. Roland suspected that the magic power, besides granting witches incredible strength, also improved their physical fitness. At least in terms of recovery ability, Anna was much faster than the average person.



"Given everything you've been through, I should have let you rest for a few more days, but we're really pressed for time, so I'll have to make it up to you later," Roland said, circling the girl. "Does this dress fit well?"



Anna was now wearing a dress that he had carefully selected from various options—to satisfy his own wicked taste. The full protective suit of an ironworker was too heavy and not suitable for her. The mage robes from the games, though impressive in appearance, were restrictive in movement, and the fully enclosed hem could easily catch fire sparks and turn into ash. As for the maid outfit, well, what could be more suitable than this?



Even if this world had not yet seen a true maid outfit, it wasn't a big problem, for the maid's work clothes already had the rudiments of future maid outfits. Thus, Roland directly asked Tyra to tailor one of her own outfits according to Anna's figure, shortening the skirt, changing long sleeves to short sleeves, transforming the round collar into a folded one, and adding a bow tie, and just like that, the new witch's uniform was born.

Paired with a pointed witch's hat (custom-made), black knee-high boots (readily available), and a short cape that didn't reach the knees (custom-made), a character that one could only see in movies stood vividly before Roland.

"Your Highness, what... do you need me to do?"

Anna was truly unable to keep up with the ideas of this noble before her; she felt she was about to lose the ability to think. When she was bagged and dragged away from the dungeon, she thought her cursed life would soon come to an end. But after the hood was removed, Anna found that instead of a gallows or guillotine, she was in a sumptuously grand room. Then a crowd of people poured in, undressing her and bathing her. From her armpits to the spaces between her toes, not a single spot was left untouched.

Then came the dressing, and she hadn't expected that dressing would require assistance, let alone that the clothes could be so comfortable—they were soft and clung to her body without causing any friction.

The last to enter was an old man with white beard. After he ordered everyone else to leave, he placed a contract in front of her. Only then did she understand that it was the fourth prince of the kingdom who had spoken of employing her in the dungeon, and the offer of employment was not a joke. The contract clearly stated that if she served the prince, she would be paid a Gold royal each month.

Anna knew what a Gold royal meant. Her father worked in the mines all day, with his salary determined by the amount of ore extracted, and even at the best of times, he would only earn a Silver royal. And it took one hundred Silver royals to exchange for a single Gold royal, and that was if the Silver royals were of full weight.

So, what was her job? To sleep with the prince? During her bath, Anna had indeed heard the maids whispering about it, but she did not think she was worth that price. Blood tainted by the devil, a fallen and impure being... anyone who knew her true identity would shun her, and even if the prince's curiosity was so strong that he feared not even the devil, he needn't pay her anything.

No one came to find her that night, and she fell asleep—it was the softest bed Anna had ever slept in, so much so that she fell into a deep slumber as soon as she lay down. When she opened her eyes the next day, it was already noon, and lunch was brought to her room by someone special: bread, cheese, and a piece of steak. She had been ready to die—what kind of yearning could a person who had decided to give up on life still have for this world? That's what she had thought. But after putting the steak in her mouth, Anna couldn't help but burst into tears.



The juices and pepper powder blended together in her mouth, the strong pungent aroma mixed with a hint of sweetness assaulting her taste buds repeatedly, lingering even after swallowing... She suddenly felt that there were still some beautiful things in this world.



If she could eat food like this every day, even when the demonic plague gnawed at her body, she would have more courage to resist, wouldn't she?



Standing in this wooden shed, which was neither like a bedroom nor a prison, she made up her mind in secret. Since the other party needed her, no matter if it was wearing such strange clothes or summoning that incredible power, she was willing to try. So she asked again, this time without hesitation.



"Your Highness, what do you need me to do?"



"For now, you must control your own power, practice it repeatedly, until you can wield it at will."



"You mean the devil's—"



"No, no, Miss Anna," Roland interrupted, "it's your power."



The witch blinked her beautiful blue eyes.



"Most people in the world are prejudiced against you, believing that a witch's power comes from the devil and is extremely evil. They are wrong," Roland squatted down, looking her in the eyes, "and you don't believe that either, right?"



He recalled Anna's light laughter in the dungeon, how could someone who considered themselves evil emit such a laugh full of mockery?

"I have never used it to harm anyone," she said softly, "except for that bandit."

"Resisting aggression is not a mistake; you did the right thing. People fear you because they do not understand you—they know that constant training can create a strong warrior, but they do not know how to become a witch. The power of the unknown is always frightening."

"You are not afraid at all," Anna said.

"Because I know that power belongs only to you," Roland chuckled, "If that bandit had such astonishing power, I wouldn't dare stand in front of him."

"Alright, let's get started," he said.
