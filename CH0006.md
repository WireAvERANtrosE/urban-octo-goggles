## Training (Part 1)
A shed had been added to the back garden of the castle, surrounded by wooden boards that only left two holes to serve as windows.

In the center of the shed was a square pool built of green bricks, about three meters in length and width, which was filled with yellow soil. With the right amount of water added, the soil was not only difficult to ignite but also had a certain plasticity, making it possible to carve out the desired shape with a small shovel. Several iron ingots were also piled on top of the yellow soil—these had been dragged over from the blacksmith's shop by Carter Lannis.

There was a well beside the pool, and it was this feature that had made Roland decide to have the shed built here.

However, as a laboratory, the place was still too primitive. He shook his head; something cobbled together in one night could hardly be considered ideal. The official workshop would have to wait until Barov gathered all the necessary information before selecting a site to start construction.

"How did you sleep last night?" he asked, turning to face the bewildered Anna, smiling.

The witch now looked completely different from when she was in the prison—after a thorough cleaning, her flaxen shoulder-length hair was smooth and lustrous, and although her skin had not been cared for, it was youthful. The light freckles on her nose added a touch of vivacity. She was still slender, her delicate frame seeming as though it would topple over with a push, but her cheeks had gained a rosy color, and the bruises and marks on her neck had faded considerably since the day before. Roland suspected that the magic not only granted the witches their miraculous powers but also improved their physical condition. At least in terms of recovery ability, Anna healed much faster than an ordinary person.

"Given all the terrible things you've been through, you should rest for a few more days, but we're really pressed for time, so I'll have to compensate you later," Roland said as he circled the girl. "Does that dress fit you well?"

Anna was now dressed in an outfit that he had selected from various designs—to satisfy his own whim. The full-body protective suit of an ironworker was too bulky and unsuitable for her. While the mage robes from games looked impressive, they were restrictive and their long hems could easily catch sparks and turn to ash. As for maid outfits, well, what could be more appropriate than that?

Even if the world had not yet seen a true maid outfit, that was not a big issue; the working clothes of the maids already bore the embryonic form of the future maid outfits. Thus, Roland had Tyra tailor one of her own outfits to fit Anna's figure, shortening the skirt, turning long sleeves into short sleeves, changing the round collar into a folded one, and adding a bowtie, creating the new witch uniform.

Paired with a custom-made pointed witch hat, black knee-high boots (off-the-shelf), and a knee-length short cape (custom-made), a character that could only be seen in movies stood vividly before Roland.

"Your Highness, what... do you need me to do?" Anna found it hard to keep up with the thoughts of this nobleman before her; she felt as though she was losing the ability to think. When she was bagged and dragged away in the dungeon, she thought her cursed life would soon come to an end. But after the bag was removed from her head, Anna found herself not in front of a gallows or a guillotine, but in a grand and splendid house. Then a group of people rushed in, undressed her, and bathed her. From her armpits to between her toes, not a spot was left unclean.

Then came the dressing, and she had not expected that putting on clothes would require assistance, let alone that they could be so comfortable—they were soft and clung to her body without causing any friction.

The last to enter was a white-bearded old man who, after ordering everyone else out, laid a contract before her. It was then that she understood that the one who had spoken of employing her in the dungeon was none other than the kingdom's fourth prince, and the talk of employment was not a joke. The contract clearly stated that if she served the prince, she would be paid a Gold royal every month.

Anna knew what a Gold royal meant; her father had worked in the mines all his life, where wages were determined by the amount of ore extracted, and the best earnings were but a Silver royal. A hundred Silver royals were needed to exchange for a Gold royal, and that was only if the Silver royals were of full weight.

So, what was her job? To sleep with the prince? While bathing, Anna did hear the maids whispering such things, but she didn't think she was worth that much. A bloodline eroded by the devil, a self-indulgent impure being... Anyone who learned of her true identity would only avoid her, even if the prince's curiosity was so strong that he didn't even fear the devil, he wouldn't need to pay her anything.

That night, no one came for her, and she fell asleep—It was the softest bed Anna had ever slept in, so much so that she fell into a dream as soon as she lay down. When she opened her eyes the next day, it was already noon, and lunch was brought to her room by someone special: bread, cheese, and a steak. She had clearly decided to die—what kind of nostalgia could a person who decided to give up on life have for this world? That was what she had thought. But after putting the steak in her mouth, Anna couldn't help but burst into tears.

The juice of the meat mixed with the pepper in her mouth, a rich and spicy flavor with a hint of sweetness assaulting her taste buds over and over, filling her mouth even after swallowing... She suddenly felt that there were still some beautiful things in this world.

If she could eat food like this every day, even when the evil demon consumed her body, she would have more courage to resist, right?

Now standing in this wooden shed that looked neither like a palace bedroom nor a prison, she made up her mind in secret. Since the other party needed her, whether it was wearing such strange clothes or summoning that incredible power, she was willing to try. So she asked again, only this time without hesitation.

"Your Highness, what do you need me to do?"

"For now, you need to control your power, practice it over and over until you can wield it at will."

"You mean the devil's—"

"No, no, Miss Anna," Roland interrupted, "It's your power."

The witch blinked her beautiful blue eyes.

"Most people in the world are prejudiced against witches, believing that a witch's power comes from the devil and is extremely evil. But they are wrong," Roland crouched down, looking at her eye to eye, "and you don't think so either, right?"

He remembered Anna's light laugh in the dungeon, how could someone who thought of themselves as evil emit such a laugh full of mockery?

"I have never used it to harm others," she said softly, "except for that bandit."

"Resisting aggression is not a fault, you did the right thing. People fear you because they don't understand you—they know that constant training can create a strong warrior, but they don't know how to become a witch. The unknown power always scares people."

"You are not afraid at all," Anna said.

"Because I know it belongs to you," Roland smiled, "If that bandit had such an amazing power, I wouldn't dare stand in front of him."

"Alright, let's get started," he said.
