## The Flame of the Heart (Part 1)
Roland knocked on the door, and after hearing Nightingale's response, he pushed the door open and entered the room.



The room had thick curtains that were only opened for ventilation in the morning and evening. At other times, they were kept closed to retain warmth and block out light.



The only source of light came from two candlesticks at the foot of the bed. The candles burned quietly, casting two intersecting shadows of the room's furnishings.



He walked to the bedside and looked at the woman still closed-eyed and unawakened, buried in the soft velvet pillows and bedding, and let out a gentle sigh.



"How is the situation at the border defense line?" Nightingale stepped forward and handed him a cup of warm water.



"Everything is still running smoothly," Roland took a casual sip and handed the cup back to her, "Since that day, we haven't encountered large groups of demonic beasts. After the injured militia members returned to the ranks, everyone's fighting spirit became... somewhat high."



"What about the damaged parts of the wall?"



"Karl used rolling logs to move the carapace of that hybrid demonic beast to the breach, and also used a winch and wooden frame to hoist it up, making it part of the wall." Roland knew that Nightingale was asking this to divert his attention, to keep him from worrying too much. But the moment he stepped into the room, all his awareness involuntarily concentrated on the sleeping woman in the bed.



If one were to say that they were still able to achieve a proud victory in the face of a massive demonic beast invasion last time, the biggest contributor was undoubtedly Anna. Without her using flames to seal the breach in the wall, the consequences would have been unimaginable.



However, after she fainted in my arms, she never woke up again.

"It's been a week already," Roland said in a low voice.

Theoretically, if a person is in a coma, not eating or drinking for a week, and there is no direct supply of nutrients from outside (such as injections), the bodily functions will start to fail, and the brain will gradually die in shock. But Anna showed no signs of weakness or critical illness—at least she looked much better than when she first fell. Her cheeks were rosy, her breathing steady, and you could feel the temperature of a normal person when you put your hand on her forehead. All signs indicated that Anna was in good health, just... unable to wake up.

"This is also the first time I've encountered such a situation," said Nightingale, shaking her head, "Her magic power was completely depleted in that battle, but now it has returned to saturation, even richer than before. If I haven't miscalculated, tonight at midnight will be her coming-of-age day."

"Are you saying she will come of age in a coma?"

"No, she will die in a coma," Nightingale stated bluntly, "The pain suffered on the coming-of-age day must be overcome with willpower. Once you give up resisting, the backlash of magic power will irreversibly destroy a witch's body."

Roland moved a chair and sat down by the bed, "But I remember you said that when a demon devours the body, no matter how painful it is, consciousness will always remain clear. You either get through this stage or choose to end your life."

"Indeed, there were people in the Union who tried to use a coma to get through the demon's devouring, and that wasn't even on the coming-of-age day... just the annual torment that had to be endured," Nightingale hesitated, then continued, "She relied on alchemical drugs to make herself fall asleep, but it was meaningless... she woke up instantly when the magic backlash occurred, and lost the ability to resist."

"Isn't this pain supposed to increase gradually?"



"It's not like that. When that moment comes, the pain will descend like thunder, but how long it lasts varies from person to person. My sisters are not weak, it's just..." her voice trailed off.



Roland understood what she meant. The uncertainty of the duration of this judgement was a torture in itself. Not knowing how long one had already endured, not knowing how much longer one must hold on—it was like a lone boat drifting in the raging sea, easily making one lose the desire to survive.



In the silence, he felt a hand rest on his shoulder.



"During the years of displacement, I've seen too much death. Witches are treated like livestock; hanged, burned, or tortured to death as nobles' playthings. Those lucky enough to escape can only live in isolation, far from the crowds. And the Holy Mountain, whose location is unknown, is just an unattainable luxury in their hearts," Nightingale's voice was softer than ever, "But Anna is different. Apart from the sisters in the Witch Union, for the first time, I've seen someone care for a witch so much. She is needed, valued, and treated like a normal person... Your Highness, even if Anna couldn't make it to adulthood, she has already found her own Holy Mountain."



But this was not the ending he had hoped for. Roland closed his eyes, recalling the scene when he first met her.



She was barefoot, her clothes tattered, caged, yet her face showed no trace of fear. Her eyes were like an unpolluted lake, clear and calm.



She was like flame, yet not as capricious as a flame.



The images flipped through his mind like a revolving lantern.



"I have satisfied your curiosity, sir. Can you kill me now?"



"I have never used it to harm anyone."

"I just want to stay by your side, Your Highness, that's all."

"Demonic plague can't kill me, I will conquer it."

"Are you dreaming? I'm not going anywhere."

...

Roland suppressed the surging thoughts and said softly, “I will stay with her until the very end.”

"So will I, and... thank you."

After dinner, Nana also arrived, hearing that Anna was about to come of age, she insisted on staying as well. Roland had no choice but to arrange an extra room on the second floor for Titus Pine to stay overnight.

Thus, Roland and the two witches sat quietly by the bed, silently waiting for midnight to arrive.



For Nightingale and Nana, they too had to endure the agony of demonic affliction this winter. Thankfully, each person's day of awakening was not the same, otherwise all three witches would have faced the life-or-death trial at the same moment, and Roland doubted he could maintain his calm façade in the room any longer.



There was no bell tower in the town, and within the dimly lit room by candlelight, the passage of time became indistinct. The cold wind beat against the windows, occasionally letting out a piercing whistle as it rushed through the cracks. Just as Roland felt a hint of weariness creeping over him, Nightingale suddenly said, "It's starting."



Only she could see the magic within Anna beginning to grow restless. The green flames became denser, the center shifting from incandescent to dark, the wild magic converging towards the center as if being pulled by something. It struggled and tumbled, but to no avail.



Roland couldn't see these changes, but he too sensed that something was amiss.



The candle's flame began to flicker, even though there was no wind in the room. The light it emitted grew dimmer, as if being devoured by the surrounding shadows, and then the color of the flame tip changed—the orange-red glow turned into a ghostly green fire.



He looked towards the woman in the bed. Anna was still deep in slumber, her face unchanged, as if all of this was unrelated to her.



At this point, the candlelight was almost completely obscured—not because the flame had gone out, but because the green fire was gradually consuming the orange-red part, until the light disappeared completely, and everyone was plunged into darkness.



But soon, the light rekindled. This time, however, the flame on the candlestick had turned into a pure emerald green. The three of them were illuminated under the green light, staring at each other with wide eyes, somewhat at a loss to comprehend what was happening.



At that moment, a groan from Anna drew everyone's gaze back to her.



She slowly opened her eyes.

"Anna..." Roland froze, she had woken up?

The woman blinked and smiled at him, then reached out her right hand, spread her palm, and extended it toward the prince.

A ball of green fire leapt up from the center of her palm, burning quietly.

For some reason, Roland felt as if he understood her intentions. He hesitated for a moment, then slowly inserted his fingers into the flame. The expected sensation of burning heat did not come; instead, there was only a gentle and warm feeling, as if being wrapped in warm water.
