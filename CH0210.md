## Stay or Leave
"Soap?" She picked up a piece and sniffed it near her nose, indeed detecting the fragrance of roses.

"Yes, it's hard to imagine that it was a sticky paste before it was made. To make it fragrant, His Highness even added perfume to it."

May subconsciously glanced at the price on the paper—twenty-five Silver Royals per piece was considered a luxury, but compared to even more expensive perfumes, this price seemed too low, "Are you sure it's perfume that's been added? When I performed in the capital, a noble once gave me three bottles, each only the size of a thumb, yet priced over five Gold Royals. Such a large piece of soap must contain at least half a bottle's worth, right?"

"Really?" Carter was taken aback, "Perfume is that expensive?"

"Of course," May gave him a look, "That's one of the proudest products of the King's City Alchemist Association, second only to crystal glass in sales. I heard that besides the batch dedicated to the royal family, there are only about a thousand bottles that make it to the market each year. Only the upper nobility and wealthy merchants can afford such things. If it weren't for gifts, I would never spend the earnings from several plays to buy a bottle of perfume."

"But when His Highness was making perfume, he didn't seem to use any rare materials..." Carter saw the puzzled look on May's face and added, "He said it seemed to be made from sugarcane? Sugarcane, or sweet rod, is a crop from the Fjords, looks like a stick, and gives a mouthful of sweetness when bitten into. Currently, it's only planted in the castle's backyard. Next time, I'll ask His Highness if I can bring one out for you."

It's Prince Roland again... Since May came to the town, the name Roland Wimbledon was what she heard the most. Whether it was Irene or Carter, when they talked about the changes in the town, they would mention him. It seemed that His Highness knew everything and that all these novel things were created by him.

Is there really such a learned person in the world? She doubted this; even the most intelligent person needs time to learn new knowledge. Whether in the capital or Longsong Stronghold, the recognized scholars were all old men with white hair. There was even a saying among the Western Region's folk: The longer the beard, the wider the knowledge. The prince himself was only in his twenties, how could he know so much?

While thinking this, May's expression remained calm, "No need, if it can be used to make perfume, it must be a very rare crop. Especially the formula for perfume, it could fetch a sky-high price in any alchemy workshop. You must not inquire about it with His Highness, and even if you see it, you must never speak of it."



"Alright." Carter responded, taking out a handkerchief and wrapping the four bars of soap inside.



"You're buying so many?"



"One person is limited to purchasing two bars at most. We'll pretend to buy separately, and then I'll give them all to you after we leave—don't disagree just yet," the knight raised his hand to stop May from speaking, "I can always apply for more from His Highness when I run out, but who knows when new stock will arrive if they sell out here. With these four bars, you can use them for quite a long time."



May looked into his earnest eyes and felt as if something had touched her heart. Use them for quite a long time... She pursed her lips and fell silent, watching quietly as the knight finished wrapping the soap.



"Since we're here, let's take a look at the other goods," he said with a smile, picking up the cloth bag.

...

Returning to her "home" in Border Town, the world outside the window was already a dusky yellow.



The setting sun's glow filtered through the window, casting a touch of orange-red on the room's furnishings.



Since staying here to perform the subsequent plays, May had also obtained a room just like Irene's. Although it was not large, it was fully equipped.



She laid out the novel commodities she had purchased from the convenience store on the table, which included four bars of soap and a bottle of liquor.

This bottle of liquor was different from the common beer and wine seen in taverns; it was almost colorless, as clear and transparent as water. She remembered the product description stated that it was called Baijiu, with a higher concentration and not suitable for excessive drinking.

Baijiu, she chuckled to herself, the name indeed matched its appearance.

She pulled out the wooden stopper and poured herself a cup. As she lifted the cup, a pungent odor assaulted her nose, causing her to frown. However, after the initial scent dissipated, a whiff of the liquor's fragrance entered her nostrils, sweet and rich, nothing like the diluted and inferior liquor from the taverns.



Due to the need for full immersion and intense concentration during acting, she seldom visited taverns, only drinking a few cups when the theater had a collective celebration after a great success of a play. The feeling of being tipsy wasn't unpleasant, but having witnessed many actors lose their composure after getting drunk, she always kept her alcohol consumption within a range that didn't affect her thinking.



However, May now felt a strong urge to get drunk, or she wouldn't have bought this expensive bottle of Baijiu despite Carter's dissuasion—she had heard from other actors that being drunk could block out distractions and concerns, revealing the true answers at the bottom of one's heart, and she wanted to give it a try.



May closed her eyes, tilted her head back, and poured the liquor into her mouth. Instantly, a burning sensation exploded in her throat, and she spewed out the liquor she hadn't swallowed yet, the violent coughing bringing tears to her eyes.

Damn it, is this really liquor?

Once the burning sensation had completely subsided, she bit her lip and tried again—this time, she only dared to sip in small gulps. After the initial burn, a rich fragrance emerged, and although the mixture of the two flavors was hard to describe as delicious, it did bring her a peculiar sensation.



Just half a quarter of an hour had passed when May felt a hint of dizziness come over her.

She took out a fist-sized iron box from her pocket, opened the lid, and saw a bright, shining mirror inside facing her. This mirror was unlike the copper or silver mirrors of the past; its surface was smooth and flawless, reflecting a crystal-clear image, surely worth a great deal. Through the mirror, May could see her own slightly flushed cheeks and bewildered eyes.

It was a gift from the Chief Knight when they parted ways. She had intended to refuse it, but he turned and walked away without giving her a chance to give it back. As he walked away briskly, he even turned back to wave goodbye to her. Honestly, when Carter Lannis was silent, his appearance was absolutely impeccable, but if he wasn't such a chatterbox, she probably wouldn't have been persuaded to stay.

So, should she settle down here? Away from the bustling city, to start anew in this remote little town where only a handful of people from the troupe knew her identity... The fear of the unknown made it hard for her to make up her mind.

May spread out the letters that had been sitting on the table for days—the letters Prince Roland had passed on to her through Irene, written by the manager of the Stronghold, Peter. From the letter, she learned that the Stronghold Theater had announced her disappearance, and Peter himself hoped she would return to Stronghold to continue performing.

Prince Roland had not concealed this news; he had left the choice up to her.

May downed the remaining wine in her cup, her vision gradually blurring.

She staggered over to the writing desk, spread out a piece of paper, and began to write a reply.

Amidst the swirling thoughts, she saw the Stronghold Theater, Irene, Philip Hilt, and the town square with thunderous cheers, as well as those third-rate actors who were so excited they couldn't contain themselves... Eventually, these images slowly faded, leaving only the image of Carter Lannis, smiling with a grin as he extended an invitation to her.



"Hello, Miss May, may I buy you a drink?"
