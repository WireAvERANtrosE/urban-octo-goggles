## Stay or Leave
"Soap?" She picked up a piece and sniffed it, indeed detecting the fragrance of roses.

"Yes, it's hard to imagine that before it was made, it was a sticky paste. To fill it with fragrance, His Highness even added perfume to it."

May unconsciously glanced at the price on the paper—twenty-five Silver royals per bar was quite luxurious, but compared to even more expensive perfumes, the price seemed too low. "Are you sure it's perfume that was added? When I performed in the capital, a noble once gifted me three bottles, each only the size of a thumb, yet priced over five Gold royals each. This large piece of soap must have at least half a bottle's worth added, right?"

"Really?" Carter was taken aback, "Perfume is that expensive?"

"Of course," May rolled her eyes at him, "That's one of the proudest products of the capital's Alchemists' Association. Besides crystal glass, perfume sells the best. I've heard that apart from the batch dedicated to the royal family, only about a thousand bottles make it to the market each year. Only the upper-class nobles and rich merchants can afford such a thing. If it wasn't for a gift, I would never spend the earnings of several plays to buy a bottle of perfume."

"But I didn't see His Highness use any rare ingredients when making the perfume..." Seeing May's puzzled face, Carter added, "He said it seemed to be made from sugarcane? Sugarcane is also known as sweet rod, a crop from the Fjords, looks like a stick, and biting into it gives a mouthful of sweetness. Currently, it's only planted in the castle's backyard. Next time, I'll ask His Highness if I can bring one out for you."

It's Prince Roland again... Since coming to the town, the name Roland Wimbledon was what May heard the most. Whether it was Irene or Carter, when talking about the town's changes, they always mentioned him. It seemed the prince knew everything, and all these novel things were created by him.

Could there really be such a learned person in the world? She was skeptical. No matter how smart a person was, learning new knowledge took time. Whether in the capital or Longsong Stronghold, the recognized scholars were all old men with white hair. There was even a common saying in the Western Region: The longer the beard, the wider the knowledge. The prince himself was barely in his twenties; how could he know so much?

While thinking this, May's expression remained calm, "No need, if it can be used to make perfume, it must be a very rare crop. Especially the formula for perfume, it could sell for a fortune in any alchemy workshop. You must never inquire about it with His Highness, and even if you see it, you must never speak of it."



"Alright," Carter responded, taking out a handkerchief and wrapping the four bars of soap in it.

"You're buying so many?"

"A person is limited to two bars at most, we'll pretend to buy them separately, and after we go out, I'll give them all to you—don't disagree just yet," the knight raised his hand to stop May from speaking, "I can apply for more from His Highness after I run out, but who knows when there will be new stock once these are sold out. With these four bars, you can use them for quite a long time."

May looked into his earnest eyes and felt as if something had scorched her heart. For quite a long time... she pursed her lips and fell silent, watching silently as the knight wrapped the soap bars.

"Since we're here, let's take a look at the other goods," he said with a smile, picking up the cloth bag.

...

Back at her "home" in Border Town, outside the window was a dusky yellow.

The setting sun's afterglow filtered through the window, casting a shade of orange-red on the room's furnishings.

Since staying here to perform the subsequent dramas, May had also obtained a room just like Irene's. Although it wasn't large, it had everything that was needed.



She arranged the novel items she had purchased from the convenience store on the table one by one. In addition to four bars of soap, there was also a bottle of alcohol.

This bottle of alcohol was different from the common ale and wine found in taverns; it was nearly colorless, as clear and transparent as water. She remembered the product description stated that this was called Baijiu, with a higher concentration and not suitable for excessive drinking.

Baijiu, she chuckled, the name was indeed quite fitting from its appearance.

Removing the wooden stopper, May poured herself a cup. As she lifted the cup, a pungent smell assaulted her nose, causing her to frown. However, after the initial odor, a sweet and mellow fragrance of the alcohol drifted into her nostrils, completely unlike the inferior, watered-down liquor from the taverns.

Since acting required her full devotion and concentration, she rarely visited taverns, only drinking a few cups when the theater celebrated a great success. The feeling of being intoxicated wasn't unpleasant, but having seen many actors lose their composure after drinking too much, she always kept her alcohol consumption within the limits that wouldn't affect her thinking.

Nevertheless, May now felt a strong impulse to get drunk, or else she wouldn't have bought this expensive bottle of Baijiu despite Carter's dissuasion—other actors said that drunkenness could block out distractions and worries, revealing the true answers in one’s heart, and she wanted to try it.

May closed her eyes, tilted her head back, and poured the alcohol from the cup into her mouth. Instantly, a burning sensation exploded in her throat, and the unswallowed liquor was sprayed out as a violent cough made her tear up.

Damn it, was this really alcohol?

When the burning sensation finally subsided, she bit her lip and tried again—this time, she only dared to sip in small gulps. After the spiciness came a rich mellowness; the two flavors mixed together were not exactly delicious, but they brought her a peculiar sensation.



Just half a quarter of an hour later, May felt a wave of dizziness coming over her.

She took out a fist-sized iron box from her pocket, opened the lid, and saw a bright mirror facing her. This mirror was different from the copper or silver mirrors of the past; its surface was smooth and unmarked, reflecting a crystal clear image, and was surely of considerable value. Through the mirror, May could see her own slightly flushed cheeks and bewildered eyes.

This was a gift from the Chief Knight when they parted ways. She had intended to refuse it, but he had turned and left without giving her a chance to return it. As he walked away briskly, he even turned back to wave goodbye to her. To be honest, Carter Lannis's appearance could be considered impeccable when he wasn't speaking, but perhaps if he hadn't been so talkative, she might not have been persuaded to stay.

So, should she take root here? To leave the bustling city and start anew in this remote town where only a few people from the troupe knew of her identity... Fear of the unknown made it difficult for her to make a decision.

May spread out the letters that had been on the table for several days—those were from Prince Roland, passed to her through Irene, and the writer was the manager of the fortress, Petrov. From the letter, she learned that the fortress theater had announced her disappearance, and Petrov himself hoped she would return to the fortress to continue performing.

Prince Roland didn't hide this message; he had left the choice up to her.

May drained the remaining wine in her cup, her vision gradually blurring.

She staggered to the desk, spread out a piece of paper, and began writing a reply.

Amidst the surging thoughts, she saw the fortress theater, Irene, Phyllis Hill, the town square filled with thunderous applause, and those third-rate actors so excited they couldn't contain themselves... Eventually, all these faded slowly, and in her mind, only the image of Carter Lannis with a grin, inviting her with his smile, remained.



"Hello, Miss May, may I treat you to a drink?"
