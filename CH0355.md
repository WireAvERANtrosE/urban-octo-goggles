A group of people stared at her with wide eyes, and after a while, the prince cleared his throat and said, "Isn't that red mist highly corrosive, impossible to approach?"



"It only affects witches. According to the research results of the Explorers Association, ordinary people, animals, and plants can all survive under the red mist, and flames can accelerate its dissipation," Agatha said directly. "Didn't you say that mortals can defeat the devils? Then prove it to me! The Double-winged Terror can be lured away by the flying witches," she pointed at Tilly, "The rest can set up the battle formation in advance, awaken the devils, and wait for them to walk into the trap. If it's really like you said, we should be able to easily swallow up this stronghold, right?"



Roland smiled and shook his head, "I didn't tell you before that this scouting mission was completed using hot air balloons, not the flying witches you thought of—this kind of floating device can only carry a dozen people at a time, so it's probably not possible to transport ordinary soldiers over. And..." he paused, "The plan you've arranged is not foolproof. No one knows how many devils are lurking underground, and close combat is likely to result in casualties. Luring the Terror is also risky, and I can't let them take the risk."



How could there be a perfect plan for fighting devils, Agatha thought angrily. Every time the Holy Army took the initiative to attack, everyone was prepared to die in battle with the devils. He's definitely deceiving himself! To achieve a goal, it's normal to suffer casualties; only those who have never experienced the cruelty of war would care so much about the life and death of their troops.



Although disappointed in her heart, she still controlled her emotions and did not reveal her doubts. After the inspection of the so-called new weapon in the afternoon, everything would be concluded.



But at this moment, Agatha did not hold much hope.



A prince who was all talk, a group of supporting witches, and frail mortals, no matter how powerful the weapons, how strong could they be?



Perhaps from the moment the Union collapsed and dissipated, the extinction of mankind had already been destined.



"You've mentioned the 'Battle of Divine Will' several times in your speech, why do you call it that? Isn't this a war to resist the invaders, the devils?" Roland asked, changing the sheet of paper and picking up a quill pen.



"Everyone calls it that, but the historical records do not mention the cause of the war," Agatha replied somewhat despondently, "It's not wrong to say it's a war against invaders. The devils indeed came through the stone gate to Dawn Land—"

"What stone gate?" Scroll couldn't help but interrupt.

"The Hell's Gate that rises from the ground," she sighed, "Whenever the bleeding red moon descends, Hell's Gate would open, swallowing the world we live in, that's what the history books say—In any case, these damned stone gates open every few centuries, and it was through them that the first devils came to Dawn Land, attempting to drive us to extinction."

"Is the enemy's attack cycle related to this as well?"

"They need the Red Mist to survive. If they leave the range of the Red Mist, they must carry storage containers with them—skins, iron boxes, or jars made from the shells of evil beasts. That's also why we still have a chance for a second and third Battle of Divine Will. When the stone gates appear, the devils can build obelisks that can produce Red Mist on their own—these black towers are almost higher than the mountains, with a very wide spread, almost one enough to cover the entire Fertile Plains." She spoke slowly, "If the next Battle of Divine Will were to erupt, then it would surely be because the devils have constructed an obelisk at the center of the Fertile Plains, turned the plains into their homeland, and then launch an attack on you from the camps on the edge of the Red Mist. This time, humanity has no way out."

"If it really comes to that day, everyone could still go to the Fjords for shelter," Tilly shrugged.

"You mean those few islands in the Whirlpool Sea? How many people can such a small piece of land sustain? It's nothing but waiting for doomsday in despair," Agatha said irritably.

"Alright, let's all be optimistic. At least we now have a general understanding of the devils," the Prince spread his hands, "When the third Battle of Divine Will begins, we won't be unprepared. Let's stop here for today, and we'll talk about other matters after lunch."

...



After a sumptuous lunch, Agatha followed Wendy back to her room.

Life in the Fertile Plains was more... lavish than she had anticipated. The variety and flavor of the dishes far surpassed any feast she could remember—perhaps because she was born in a time of war, when food, whether in her own stone tower or at the Union fortress, mainly consisted of bread, jerky, and vegetable soup. But here, there was salt, butter, honey, and all sorts of spices she couldn't name. Despite her need to maintain decorum, she couldn't help but clean out the entire plate of fried mushrooms and two large pepper steaks.

The more she enjoyed it, the angrier she became. She was furious with herself for not being able to resist the temptation of delicious food, feeling she had disgraced Taquila Holy City, and also thought it shortsighted of the prince to indulge in fine dining at such a critical time. Humanity was on the brink of extinction, and he seemed blissfully unaware!

"I've become familiar with the castle now," she said with a stiff tone, "You need not trouble yourself with guiding me back next time."

"It's no trouble at all, I'm happy to do these things..." Wendy replied with a smile, "And if you have anything you want to talk about, you can share it with me. Keeping it to yourself will only make you feel worse."

"He said he would take me to see the new weapons test this afternoon, didn't he? Why did he leave the parlor alone after lunch?"

"Do you mean Prince Roland? Well... I think His Highness plans to take a nap," Wendy covered her mouth, "It's his habit to sleep for an hour at midday. His Highness often says that one's body is the capital for their work, and without sufficient rest, one cannot fulfill their duties as a lord."

A nap? What sort of habit is that! Isn't a whole night's sleep enough for him? Agatha thought indignantly. This is clearly an excuse for the lazy, and you all actually take it at face value!

"Whether ordinary witches or high-order Awakened... Why do you all trust him so much?" she took a deep breath, "Is it just because he provided you with a place to live? Do you really believe that he can defeat the demons... no, even overcome the church that oppresses you?"



"I don't know what the other sisters think," Wendy said softly, "but I believe. His Highness has turned things that others cannot imagine, or dare not imagine, into reality. To me, those are miracles one after another."

"Mir...acles?"

"When the witches were being hunted and pursued, he saved the Witch Cooperation Association; when everyone else saw us as evil beings, he created a domain where witches and ordinary people could coexist. In just one year, His Highness formed an army of commoners that held back the demonic beast invasion and defeated Duke Ryan whose territory was several times larger; even the frenzied army of the Kingdom of Greycastle couldn't step into the Western Territory."

"But these are just battles between mortals, completely different from the Divine Punishment Army and devils," Agatha shook her head.

"Of course, there's more," Wendy continued, "He taught knowledge and ideas that evolved the abilities of four sisters, he not only created powerful machines, but also weapons that allow knights, and even ordinary people to defeat extraordinary witches... These are the miracles that I can see, not epics passed down in taverns, nor legends from books—they are all happening around me."

"One day, he will become the King of Greycastle, leading us to defeat any enemy," her eyes twinkled with amusement, but her voice was filled with confidence, "That's what I believe."
