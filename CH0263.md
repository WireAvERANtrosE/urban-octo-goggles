## "The wheat has ripened."
Under the scorching sun, Sonny Dali donned a straw hat and walked along the riverbank to check the growth of the wheat.

After nearly four months of planting, the wheat was now basically mature.

At a glance, the wheat field stretched to the horizon like a golden ocean, with thick and full ears of wheat. Not only had the number of grains doubled, but the size of each grain was also larger than any spring wheat he had seen before. Sonny didn't need to wait for the harvest to weigh them to know that this year was bound to be a bumper year.

Without a doubt, this had to be the work of witches.

Having farmed with his father for ten years, he knew well what normal wheat should look like: one to three ears per plant, each ear yielding twenty to thirty grains. While the fertility of the soil indeed affected the size of the grains, to double the number of grains an ear produced? Other than witches, he could think of no other explanation.

There were many other changes like this. For example, the towering water tower in the town—he had observed those behemoths up close. It was simply impossible to lift a huge iron barrel onto a metal frame taller than a residential building with manpower alone, not to mention that they were almost all built overnight. Now, the townspeople living in the district rarely needed to carry buckets to fetch water; by simply turning on the tap, cool well water would pour out from the pipes.

The "island" in the middle of the Redwater River was the same. Ever since His Highness held the awarding ceremony and brought Miss Nana onto the stage, the use of witches had become increasingly unhidden. Creating a piece of land out of thin air in the middle of an empty river was clearly something only witches could do.

He once asked Barov, the Chief Officer of the City Hall, about this matter. The answer he received was not to worry about it; Prince Roland had his own plans.

Well... after all, the royal family always loved to go against the church. Even if the latter sent an army to conquer the prince, they would have to defeat the First Army to have the right to speak. Otherwise, the Western Territory could only belong to Roland Wimbledon.



Is not Duke Lion the best example?



"My lord, you are here," two serfs weeding in the field immediately approached Sonny Dali, "Look, this wheat field will soon be ready for harvest, so, so we wanted to ask you..."



"Are you asking if what the lord said before still stands?"



"Yes, yes, yes," the serfs nervously rubbed their hands and said, "Can we really be promoted to freemen?"



As the head of the Agricultural Department, Sonny's duties, aside from recording the best planting methods and tallying the harvest, included an important responsibility: to communicate with the serfs and promptly convey the policies of His Highness and the City Hall to them. Although he didn't like these country bumpkins who dealt with mud all day, the knight's self-discipline still made him fulfill his task.



"Do you see those banners?" Sonny pointed towards the banners on the edge of the fields.



"My lord, I... I don't understand..." the serf said with an embarrassed smile.



"Labor creates wealth, labor changes fate," he said, "That means, as long as you work hard in farming, you have the opportunity to become freemen. This is a promise made by His Highness, and it will certainly be fulfilled."



"Really? That's wonderful!"



"Additionally, after becoming a freeman, you may move into the central district of the town, own your brick house, and also gain the right to receive primary education. Then you won't need to ask me what these slogans mean," Sonny repeated the corresponding propaganda content.



"Yes, my lord," the serf nodded excitedly, "It's hot; would you like to sit in my shed for a while and have a glass of barley water?"



"No, you all go ahead," he waved them off, watching the two bow and thank him for a long time before returning to the fields to continue their previous work. This was the question Sonny had heard the most in the past month; no matter how much he explained, they would tirelessly ask again, fearing that the lord would cancel the policy in the blink of an eye.



Not far away, someone else approached, "Hello, Lord Sonny, after harvesting and drying the wheat, do we really only have to give up seventy percent?"



He sighed inwardly; this question was second only to 'promotion of freemen,' ranking it second, "The first year is indeed so, and it will only decrease over time. If you become a freeman, you only need to give up twenty percent. This has been emphasized repeatedly."



"If we could really get promoted, that would be great," one of the tall ones said, scratching the back of his head, "Then the remaining thirty percent of the wheat, can we—"



"You can only sell it to His Highness the Prince, consume it yourselves, or keep it for seeding." Sonny clapped his hands and straightforwardly called all the surrounding serfs over, "Listen up, private sale of food is prohibited in Border Town, whether it's to local townspeople or to foreign merchants, both violate the laws of Border Town. If you do so, not only will the earnings be confiscated, but you may also face imprisonment."



"What if the lord offers a very low price?" the tall one muttered.



"Of course, that won't happen. His Highness will purchase the grain at a stable market price, regardless of whether it's a poor harvest or a bountiful one, there won't be significant fluctuations. So you don't have to worry about not being able to afford food after selling your wheat, nor do you have to worry about having too much harvest that you can't sell it or have to sell it at a low price," Sonny emphasized, "In the entire Border Town, there's only one place where you can sell grain, and that's the convenience market, and the market is managed by our Municipal Hall."



"So what exactly is the price...?"

"Don't worry, His Highness will announce it to you personally before the purchase."

Watching the serfs disperse in twos and threes, he licked his somewhat dry lips and continued to inspect the crops. He didn't know how many of them would take his words to heart, but Lord Barov had already conveyed His Highness's firm will clearly; those who sell grain privately will face severe punishment.

At this moment, a young serf broke away from the group, turned around, and came back, panting, "Sir," he said, "I have another question to ask you."

"Hm?"

"Do you know where Miss May and Lady Irene have gone?" he hesitated, "There haven't been any plays in the square recently, and I wanted to... inquire about their well-being, to see if they are... ill?"

This was indeed a fresh and interesting question. Sonny couldn't help but curl his lips in amusement. If he hadn't happened to see them at the City Hall taking care of some formalities, he wouldn't have been able to answer, "They have gone to Longsong Stronghold."

"Ah," the other party showed a look of disappointment, "So they don't plan to stay in Border Town?"

"They've just gone to the stronghold's theater to perform," he shrugged, "Besides, with the weather being so hot, you wouldn't want to see them drenched in sweat under the sun, would you? When autumn comes, they will continue to perform new plays in the square."



"So that's how it is... Thank you, my lord!"



Watching the young lad leave contentedly, Sonny couldn't help but reflect on his own experiences—from knight to captive, and then from captive to a municipal official in the City Hall. The past few months could be described as a roller-coaster. He had no desire to return to the Wolfheart Family's territory, where there was nothing but dilapidated houses and vast wheat fields. Becoming a knight was just a way to escape a life of farming like his father before him.



Not every knight could be as glorious as the Knights of Dawn or possess the best territories and followers like the Duke's Knights. Now, his annual salary was even higher than when he was a knight, and there was also great potential for advancement. Perhaps it was time to bring his parents to the town and then marry a girl, to fully enjoy life.
