## "The wheat has ripened."
Under the scorching sun, Sani Dahl walked along the riverbank wearing a straw hat, inspecting the growth of the wheat ears.



After nearly four months of cultivation, the wheat was now essentially ripe.



At a glance, the boundless wheat field looked like a golden ocean, the ears thick and full. Not only had the number of grains doubled, but the size was also larger than any spring wheat he had seen before. Sani knew without waiting for the harvest and weighing that this year was bound to be a bountiful one.



Without a doubt, this had to be the work of the witches.



Having farmed with his father for ten years, he was well aware of how ordinary wheat should look — one to three ears per plant, with twenty to thirty grains per ear. Fertile soil indeed affects the size of the wheat grains, but a doubling in the number of grains? He could think of no other explanation than the witches.



There were many such changes, like the towering water tower in the town — he had observed those huge structures up close. It was simply impossible to hoist a massive iron barrel onto an iron frame taller than a residential building by manpower alone, not to mention they were almost always built overnight. Now, the townspeople living in the community seldom needed to carry buckets to draw water; by turning on the tap, cool well water would pour out from the pipes.



The "island" in the middle of the Redwater River was the same. Ever since His Highness held the awarding ceremony and brought Miss Nana onto the stage, the use of witches had become increasingly unhidden. To make a piece of land appear out of thin air in the middle of the empty river was clearly something only witches could do.



He had once inquired about this matter with Barov, the executive officer of the town hall, and the answer he received was to not bother about it, as Prince Roland had his own plans.



Well... after all, the royal family always loved to oppose the church. Even if the latter sent armies to condemn the prince, they would have to defeat the First Army before they had the right to speak. Otherwise, the Western Region could only belong to Roland Wimbledon.



Duke Ryan is the best example, isn't it?

"My lord, you've arrived,” two serfs weeding in the field immediately approached Sini Dali, “Look, this wheat field can be harvested soon, so, we wanted to ask you..."

“Are you asking if the words spoken by the lord before are still valid?”

“Yes, yes, yes,” the serf said nervously, rubbing his hands, “Can we really be promoted to free people?”

As the person in charge of the Department of Agriculture, besides recording the best planting methods and tallying the harvest, Sini had another important duty: to communicate with the serfs and promptly convey the policies of His Highness and the City Hall to them. Although he didn’t like these country bumpkins who dealt with mud all day, the knight’s discipline still made him fulfill his task.

“Do you see those banners?” Sini pointed towards the banner at the edge of the field.

“My lord, I... I can’t understand…” the serf said with an embarrassed smile.

“Labor creates wealth; labor changes fate,” he said, “That means, as long as you work hard at farming, you have the chance to be promoted to a free person. This is a promise made by His Highness, and it will certainly be fulfilled.”

“Really? That's wonderful!”



"Additionally, after becoming freemen, you can move into the central district of the town, own your own brick house, and gain the right to receive primary education. Then you won't need to ask me what these slogans mean," Sereni repeated the corresponding promotional content once again.



"Yes, sir," the serf nodded excitedly, "It's hot, would you like to sit in my shed for a while and have a drink of barley water?"



"No, thank you. You may go on with your work," he waved his hand and watched the two bow and thank him profusely before returning to their labor in the fields. This was the question Sereni had heard the most in the past month. No matter how many times he explained, they would tirelessly ask again, as if they feared that the lord would suddenly revoke the policy in the blink of an eye.



Not far away, another group approached him, "Hello, Lord Sereni, after harvesting and drying the wheat, do we really only have to hand over seventy percent?"



He sighed inwardly, this question was the second most common after "promotion to freemen," "Indeed, the first year is so, and it will only decrease thereafter. If you become a freeman, you only need to hand over twenty percent, as we have emphasized repeatedly."



"If only we could really be promoted," one tall man said, scratching the back of his head, "Then the remaining thirty percent of the wheat, can we—"



"You can only sell it to His Highness the Prince, consume it yourselves, or keep it as seed." Sereni clapped his hands, deciding to call all the surrounding serfs over, "Listen well, Border Town prohibits the private sale of grain, whether to local townspeople or to foreign merchants, all of which violate the laws of Border Town. If you do so, not only will the proceeds be confiscated, but you may also face imprisonment."



"What if the lord only offers a very low price?" the tall man muttered.



"That certainly won't happen. His Highness will purchase grain at a stable market price, regardless of whether it's a poor harvest or a bumper one. So you don't have to worry about not being able to afford food after selling your wheat or about having too much harvest leading to unable to sell or forced to sell at a low price," Sereni emphasized, "In the whole of Border Town, there is only one place where you can sell grain, and that is the Convenience Market, and the market is managed by our City Hall."



"What exactly is the price...?"

"Rest assured, His Highness will announce it to you personally before the purchase."

Watching the serfs disperse in twos and threes, he licked his somewhat dry lips and continued to check the condition of the crops. He wondered how many among these people would take his words to heart, but Lord Barov had already clearly conveyed His Highness's firm will. Those who dealt in private grain sales would be met with severe punishment.



Just then, a young serf broke away from the crowd, turned, and came back. "Sir," he panted, "I have another question to ask."

"Hmm?"

"Do you know where Miss May and Lady Irene have gone?" he hesitated, "There hasn't been a play in the square recently, and I wanted... to inquire about their well-being, to see if they are... sick?"



This was a fresh and interesting question. Sini couldn't help but curl his lips into a smile. If he hadn't happened to see them handling formalities at the City Hall, he wouldn't have been able to answer, "They've gone to the Longsong Stronghold."

"Ah," the man looked disappointed, "So they don't plan on staying in Border Town?"

"They've just gone to perform at the stronghold's theater," he shrugged, "Besides, with the weather being so hot, you wouldn't want to see them drenched in sweat under the sun, right? When autumn comes, they will continue to perform new plays in the square."



"So, that's how it is... Thank you, my lord!"

Watching the young man leave with satisfaction, Seine couldn't help but think of his own journey—from knight to prisoner, and then from prisoner to a town hall official. His experiences over the past few months could be described as a roller coaster ride. He did not want to return to the Wolfheart Family's territory, where there was nothing but dilapidated houses and vast wheat fields. Becoming a knight was simply a way to escape a lifetime of farming like his father before him.



Not every knight could live as gloriously as the Knights of Dawn, or possess the best lands and retinues like the Duke's knights. Now, his annual salary was more than what he earned as a knight, and he also had considerable prospects for advancement. Perhaps it was time to bring his parents to the town, marry a girl, and truly enjoy life.
