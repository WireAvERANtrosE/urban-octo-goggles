## Sacred Mountain (Part 2)
Leaf felt as if all the blood in her body had frozen.



In the night to the left, two shadows slowly emerged, large and peculiar in shape, unlike the common demonic beasts. Only when they got closer did Leaf realize that they were two humanoid creatures riding on hybrid species. They were tall, twice the size of a normal person, unarmored, and wearing clothes made of indistinguishable material—no, calling it clothes was a stretch; it was more like swollen animal hide, tightly wrapped from head to toe, bulging in many places.



The most striking feature was the headgear the two were wearing, which was clearly made from the skulls of demonic beasts, ferocious and terrifying. The eyes of the skulls had been hollowed out and stitched with a reddish-brown crystal. A leather tube full of patches extended from the lower edge of their headgear, stretching into a huge shell pouch behind them. One of the riders had several long spears on his mount, while the other wore a strangely shaped iron glove—with its design, they seemed to only have three fingers.



One word flashed through Leaf's mind: "Devils."



"Engage the enemy!"



Cara was the first to react, her piercing scream drawing everyone's attention back to the foe. Stone, with a touch of her hand on the ground, turned the vast expanse of snow in front of her into a soft swamp. This was an extremely correct response: the mounts of the enemies, the wolf-headed, winged hybrids, were fast and capable of short-distance flight. But these two were different; their wings had been chopped off, the exposed bones tied with hemp ropes, held in the devils' hands. Unable to fly over the swamp, they would have to go around, giving the other sisters time to react.



However, the enemies didn't act as the witches had expected. They drove their mounts forward, plunging headlong into the swamp, and then, with the momentum, leaped from the backs of the demonic beasts, clearing a distance of several meters, landing behind Stone. And there, was where the non-combatant sisters were gathered.



"Spread out!" Before Leaf could finish speaking, the devil with the three-fingered iron glove had already begun a massacre among the crowd. His agility was completely out of sync with his size, and a witch who was too close to react was punched in the head, shattering her skull. Then, two more sisters had their necks snapped by the thick iron hands, and the others finally realized what was happening, scattering in panic. Only Sino stood her ground; although her ability was not suitable for combat, she did not turn to flee, instead taking a crossbow from her back, aiming, and shooting at the enemy. The iron-handed devil dodged to the side and kicked her away with such force that it sounded like a dull thunder. The young girl flew a long distance before tumbling to the ground, blood clots spilling from her mouth.



The devil wielding the spear turned and walked towards Stone, who was already too scared to move. Just as the spear was about to pierce the witch's chest, a ball of fire exploded in front of him. Red Pepper rolled under the enemy's crotch, grabbed Stone's hand, and they both turned to run. The foe tried to follow, but was stopped by a wall of black mist.



Leaf injected all her magic power into the ground, causing various plants to grow wildly, intertwining into a thorny vine that climbed towards Ironhand. The "Pain" serpent summoned by Cara also bit fiercely onto the opponent's arm. Just as he was shaking off those annoying venomous snakes, the quietly approaching vine from behind suddenly pounced, entangling his legs, and with a pull backward, the enemy's massive body thudded to the ground.



"Run, sisters, run fast!" Leaf shouted, her voice trembling with fear. Escape quickly, get away from these terrible monsters—they are the source of evil recorded in the ancient books, devils that have crawled out of the gates of hell!



It seemed that the tormenting venom of the serpent was ineffective against them. Ironhand, who had fallen, arched his body as if trying to grab the vine that was dragging him all over the place. The Spear Devil, seeing his companion in trouble, quickly turned his attention to Leaf, who was controlling the vine. He raised his spear, took a throwing stance, and his arm swelled rapidly. The already bulging skin was stretched to a thin layer, through which the dark red blood vessels and bones could even be seen.



"Leaf, watch out!" Stonewoman once again turned the ground into a quagmire, this time casting it directly beneath the devil's feet. The devil sank sharply downward, and the thrown spear instantly changed direction, slanting into the ground in front of Leaf. The nearly man-high spear shaft almost completely submerged, scaring Leaf into a cold sweat.



The swollen arm quickly shrunk after the throw, soon becoming as dry as kindling.



The Spear Devil couldn't throw continuously! She realized immediately that now was the perfect time to escape. The other witches also noticed this, and Stonewoman, along with Redpepper and Chase, ran past Ironhand, who was still struggling on the ground, heading towards the unattended Cara, wanting to take their mentor and leave together. Only Leaf saw that the devil being pulled by the vine reached out with both hands toward the three.



What does he want to do? Wait!



"No—" She didn't even have time to open her mouth to warn them when a blinding blue light burst from Ironhand, like lightning tearing through the sky, twisting and striking the three sisters. The blue light jumped between them, crackling with explosive sounds. They convulsed as white smoke rose from their bodies, falling down as their robes also began to burn.



This attack seemed to have exhausted a great deal of the enemy's strength; he emitted heavy breathing sounds and moved no more. Meanwhile, Leaf's magic power had reached its limit; the vine disintegrated and soon turned into a bunch of withered weeds.



Everything was over, she thought. The desperate cries of the instructor seemed to become distant as her strength drained away like the tide, and she fell to the ground powerlessly.



Ironhand slowly rose from the snow after resting for a moment, walking towards Cara, who was now stricken with terror, with no one left to stop him. The devil grabbed the instructor's throat, and she desperately tried to pry his fingers open, but it was meaningless in the face of the vast difference in strength. As she struggled, magic snakes surged out, biting at the enemy's arms and neck, yet he remained undisturbed, continuing to tighten his iron grip.



At that moment, an accident happened. In a chaotic attack, a magic snake bit through the lower part of the devil's headgear tube. A red mist sprayed from the break, quickly enveloping Cara and the devil. The former let out a terrifying scream as her skin rapidly corroded under the red mist, revealing tendons and white bones. The latter released his iron grip, frantically trying to block the tube, and as the mist rapidly dissipated, his body began to uncontrollably tremble and soon collapsed, motionless.



The devil wielding a spear, half-buried in the swamp, cried out upon seeing this. Leaf had never heard such a sound, a mix of sharp screeches and deep roars that painfully pierced her ears.



However, the enemy's roar did not make Leaf flee in panic; instead, it gave her the only chance for victory.



Biting her lip, she struggled to her feet, picked up the hand crossbow that had fallen from Sino, re-strung it, and walked up to the spear-wielding devil. The devil clearly understood what she intended to do; his arms flailed desperately, but in the swamp, the more he struggled, the faster he sank. He tried to cover the tube, but the part that extended to the back of his shell sac was completely exposed.



For my lost sisters, Leaf thought as she aimed at the tube and pulled the trigger.



The crossbow bolt pierced the tube accurately, and the red mist hissed out from the break. When the mist had sprayed out completely, the opponent's head drooped down.



She had killed the devil.



Dropping her crossbow, Leaf turned back to look at the more than a dozen lifeless sisters and knelt to the ground, bursting into loud sobs.
