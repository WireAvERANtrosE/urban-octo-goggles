## Evolutionary Ability
After returning to her room, Anna threw a cluster of green flame into the large wooden tub filled with water, and soon steam began to rise from the surface of the water.



She stripped off her clothes and stepped into the tub.



When the witches wanted to clean themselves, they would all come to Anna for help heating water—it was quite a troublesome task to carry hot water up from the kitchen after all. His Highness seemed rather surprised when he learned about this, as if he couldn’t accept the practice of reusing bathwater.



Thinking about it made Anna chuckle. For commoner families, it was difficult to wash their bodies even once a month, so reusing water multiple times was more than common.



He hadn’t even realized how much the living conditions of the witches he had taken in had improved. Anna shook her head; Prince Roland Wimbledon seemed knowledgeable and skilled, but in some areas, he could be...clumsy. Shouldn't princes, according to the stories she read in books, be involved in all sorts of banquets and social gatherings from a young age, moving among the flowers? They might be ignorant, they might be timid in battle, but at least they should be good at socializing.



However, this feeling unexpectedly comforted her.



His Highness had many astonishing pieces of knowledge in his mind, such as iron machines that operated on steam, or making stones float on water through calculation. And today’s lesson—that this world was made up of countless tiny spheres, so small that they had to be magnified millions of times to be seen by the naked eye. For this reason, they were everywhere, whether in solids, gases, or liquids, whether in people, plants, or stones. When broken down to the very end, they were essentially all the same.



Incredible, Anna thought, how does His Highness know all this?



After wiping her body clean, she used a burst of fire to dry the droplets of water on her skin. She put on her clothes and sat back down at the desk.



The textbook written by Roland was placed right in the center of the table.

Taking advantage of the remaining duration of the Book of Magic, Anna borrowed this textbook from the scrolls, hoping to read a little more before going to sleep.

The book starts with common phenomena in daily life and progresses step by step, like peeling an onion, with some sections even accompanied by vivid and interesting pictures. The unheard-of knowledge captivated her, and Anna found it difficult to stop once she had turned the first page.

However, the content in the front was still relatively simple; the later sections became increasingly difficult to understand. For example, in the section on temperature, it stated that cold and heat are both manifestations of the activity level of tiny spheres, and the more energy obtained, the more active the spheres, which also appear hotter on a macroscopic level. If His Highness was correct, then would her own amplified green flame also be jumping tiny spheres?

The candle gradually burned down over time, the flame flickering twice before extinguishing. At that moment, the Book of Magic also reached its time limit, with the pages and writing gradually becoming transparent, then disappearing without a trace. Darkness instantly engulfed the room, until a green flame blossomed from Anna's fingertips, dispelling the night that had poured into the room.

Looking at the empty table, she felt a sense of loss.

She raised her right hand, and the ghostly green magical fire, like a cluster of glowworms, stood still at her fingertips.

Suddenly, she wanted to try—if everything was composed of tiny spheres, could it also become as small as those spheres? Anna closed her eyes, envisioning it as being made up of countless particles.

The flame began to change.



It transformed from a droplet-like shape into a thin line, becoming finer and longer, until it was like a strand of hair.

Anna sensed this change. It was still far from enough, she thought. Even a hair strand was much larger compared to the sphere. It could become even finer.

Though she thought so, the green flame seemed to have difficulty changing further; its light dimmed, and the slender green glow began to tremble.

Perhaps accumulation was not the way, but rather, linkage... His Highness said that there are chains that fixed the spheres to each other. Maybe she should reshape its form.

The particles of flame in Anna's mind flickered twice and then scattered with a clink. They were no longer tightly connected but spread out like stars. The slender green flame disappeared, but in her consciousness, the flame still existed, just without its original form—In the boundless darkness, after most of the stars fell, the remaining few slowly regrouped. They lined up one by one, eventually forming a filament composed of starlight.

Temperature is the level of activity, she thought.

As soon as the thought emerged, the line began to sway, as if someone had pinched one end and gently shook it. After this slight shake, the filament's oscillations could not stop, and wave after wave rippled along it.

Ripples spread across her world, and the outlines between things were no longer distinct. They leaped joyously with the waves. Magic was the same. She even felt that by stretching out a finger and flicking the first ripple, what she flicked was the magic itself.

She opened her eyes, and everything returned to tranquility. The green flame was no longer visible. As her eyes adjusted to the darkness of the room, the desk, wardrobe, candlestick... the room's furnishings emerged one by one from the shadows. Pale blue moonlight filtered through the window onto the floor, casting small patches of gray and white. Everything appeared as usual, without any change.



But in her eyes, the world had become completely different. A black filament emerged in the air—Anna knew it wasn't truly "seen," but rather perceived by her own senses.



She felt under the table for a practice iron ingot and placed it in front of her.



The black thread wrapped around the iron ingot according to her will, then quickly tightened. Like a hot knife through butter, the filament effortlessly sank into the ingot. Under Anna's control, the high temperature produced by the thread was several times stronger than the green flame, yet it was confined to a very narrow area. The ingot was soon split into two, and when she picked up half, she saw the cut surface was smooth and still warm to the touch.



Then she stood the ingot up, placing the black thread at the top, and split off another thread to lie horizontally, perpendicular to it.



This was the mathematical knowledge the prince had spoken about during lessons. By using a point as the center and a taut line wrapped around it, one could draw a perfect circle. The area of the circle was equal to the length of the line multiplied by itself and then by a fixed constant.



Anna controlled the horizontal thread to bend downwards at a right angle, piercing through the ingot to the tabletop. Then she let it gently rotate around the center black line—compared to the earlier adjustments of the green flame's shape or overall temperature changes, these black flames composed of particles could not only assume any shape but also have their temperature controlled separately in different parts.



After rotating once, a standard cylindrical shape was cut out.



Because the junction was too tight, Anna exerted great effort to knock it out from the block of iron, and just like the previously seen cut surface, the entire cylindrical outer wall was incredibly smooth. In the moonlight, she could even faintly see her elongated face reflected on it.
