## Evolving Ability
After returning to her room, Anna threw a cluster of green flames into the large wooden tub filled with water, and soon steam began to rise from the surface.



She stripped off her clothes and stepped into the tub.



Whenever the witches wanted to clean themselves, they would come to Anna for help with heating the water—after all, carrying hot water from the kitchen was quite a hassle. His Highness seemed quite surprised when he learned about this and appeared to have a hard time accepting the practice of reusing bath water.



At that thought, Anna found it somewhat amusing. For commoner families, bathing even once a month was difficult, and it was very common to reuse the water multiple times.



He didn't even realize how much the living conditions of the witches he had taken in had improved. Shaking her head, Prince Roland Wimbledon seemed learned and talented, but in some areas, he could be described as... clumsy. According to the stories she had read in books, shouldn't princes be involved in various feasts and social gatherings from a young age, moving among the flowers? They could be ignorant or cowardly in battle, but at least they should be good at socializing.



However, this feeling unexpectedly reassured her.



His Highness's head was filled with knowledge that amazed her, such as iron machines powered by steam and stones that could float on water through calculation. And today's lesson—that the world is made up of countless tiny spheres, so small that they need to be magnified millions of times before they can be seen with the naked eye. For this reason, they are everywhere, whether in solids, gases, or liquids, whether in people, plants, or stones; when broken down to the very end, they are essentially the same.



Incredible, Anna thought, how does His Highness know all this?



After drying her body with a burst of fire, she put on her clothes and sat back down at her desk.



In the center of the table lay the textbook that Roland had written. 

Taking advantage of the remaining duration of the Book of Magic, Anna had borrowed this textbook, wanting to read a little more before going to sleep.

The book started with phenomena commonly seen in daily life, progressing step by step like peeling an onion, with some sections even accompanied by vivid and interesting pictures. The unheard-of new knowledge fascinated her, and Anna found it difficult to stop once she had turned the first page.

However, the content at the beginning was relatively simple, and it became more difficult to understand later on. For example, the section on temperature stated that both cold and heat were manifestations of the activity level of tiny spheres; the more energy they received, the more active they became, and on a macroscopic level, this appeared as heat. If His Highness was correct, then would her green flame also consist of leaping tiny spheres when magnified?

The candle gradually burned down with time, its flame flickered twice and then went out. At that moment, the Book of Magic also reached its time limit, its pages and words gradually becoming transparent and then disappearing without a trace. Darkness instantly engulfed the room until a green flame bloomed from Anna's fingertips, dispelling the night that had poured into the room.

Looking at the empty table, she felt a sense of loss.

Raising her right hand, the ghostly green magical fire stood still on her fingertip like a cluster of glowing light.

She suddenly wanted to try, if everything was made up of tiny spheres, could it also become as small as those spheres? Anna closed her eyes, envisioning it being made up of countless particles.

The flame began to change.



It transformed from a shape like a droplet of water into a thin line, becoming finer and longer until it was as slender as a strand of hair.

Anna felt this change; it was still far from enough. To the sphere, even a strand of hair seemed much too large. It could become even finer.

Although she thought this, the green flame seemed to have difficulty changing further, its luminance dimming as the slender green light began to tremble.

Maybe not by accumulation, but by linking... His Highness said that there are chains that fix the spheres to one another, perhaps she needed to reshape its form.

The particle flame in Anna's mind flickered, then burst with a "pop," scattering not as tightly connected anymore, but like stars spreading out. The slender green flame also vanished, but in her consciousness, the flame still existed, although it no longer retained its original form—within the profound, boundless darkness, after most of the stars fell, the remaining few slowly reconvened, lining up one by one to eventually form a thread made of starlight.

Temperature is activity, she thought.

As soon as the thought came to her, the line began to sway, as if someone had pinched one end and given it a gentle shake. After this shake, the undulation of the thread could not be stopped, with ripples spreading along it.

Ripples seemed to spread across her world, the outlines of things no longer clear, all of them jumping with the wave. Magic felt the same, and she even thought that if she stretched out her finger and plucked, it was magic itself that created the first ripple.

She opened her eyes, and everything returned to calm. The green flame was nowhere to be seen, and as her eyes adjusted to the darkness of the room, the desk, wardrobe, candlestick... the furnishings of the room each emerged from the shadows. Pale blue moonlight poured through the window onto the floor, casting small patches of gray-white. Everything looked as usual, with no change at all.



But in her eyes, the world had become completely different. A black thread appeared in the air—Anna knew it wasn't truly "seen," but rather perceived by herself.

She groped under the table for a piece of iron ingot used for practice and placed it in front of her.

The black thread wound around the iron ingot following her will, then quickly tightened. Like a hot knife through butter, the thread effortlessly embedded into the ingot. Under Anna's command, the high temperature produced by the thread was several times stronger than the green flame, yet it was confined to an extremely narrow area. The iron ingot was quickly cut into two pieces, and she picked up one half to see that the cut surface was smooth and, when touched, still retained a faint warmth.

Next, she stood the iron ingot up and positioned the black thread at the top, then split off another thread to lay horizontally, perpendicular to the first.

This was the mathematical knowledge His Highness had taught during the lessons. By using a point as the center and a taut string to circle around it, one could draw a perfect circle. The area of the circle equals the length of the string multiplied by itself and then by a fixed constant.

Anna controlled the end of the horizontal thread to bend downwards at a right angle, piercing through the iron ingot until it reached the table. She then gently rotated it around the central black line—compared to her previous ability to only adjust the overall shape or temperature of the green flame, these black flames composed of particles could not only take any shape, but also the temperature of each part could be individually controlled.

After a full rotation, a perfectly cylindrical piece was cut out.

Due to the tightness of the joint, Anna had to exert much effort to knock it out of the block of iron. Just like the previously seen cut surface, the entire cylindrical outer wall was incredibly smooth. Under the moonlight, she could even faintly see her own elongated face reflected on it.
