## Backlash
Hermes Cathedral, the Sky Tower.

The newly appointed Pope, Mayne, sat quietly in a secret chamber, listening to reports from three bishops.

Aside from the old Bishop Tayfun, the two newly promoted archbishops, Soli Dal and Earl, who came from the Judgement Army and the Arbitration Court respectively, had their own merits. The former, a valiant Chief Judge, had built a high reputation over twenty-five years of military service, while the latter, Hester's aide-de-camp, was considered the rightful successor to his predecessor.

"This year, the adoption of orphans in the Everwinter region during the Evil Months has gone smoothly. The nobles from all the major cities have fully turned to the Church, and the number of people sent to the Old Holy City has already exceeded the planned target by threefold," Tayfun remarked with emotion, "This is the only piece of good news lately."

Nobles are like that, quick to switch sides when the situation turns unfavorable. Mayne nodded, "This is just the first year, there will be more to come—if we can take over the entire continent, the number of people we receive each year could easily fill a new city."

"I hope so," he sighed, "Since the heavy snowfall, how many times have we been attacked by evil beasts on a large scale?"

"Six times," Soli answered.

"Six times... Over a hundred Judgement Warriors have fallen on the front lines," Tayfun said with a heavy tone, "The God's Punishment Army has also lost ten men, and by next year, the onslaught from the evil beasts will only grow fiercer."

"Compared to fighting devils, this is already considered easy," Earl spread his hands, "Although I've never seen with my own eyes how powerful the deviles are, the holy book seems to describe them as invincible. I wonder, is it really necessary for us to hold out to the bitter end here?"



"What do you mean by that!" Sori furrowed his brows, "The gods have shown us the way and endowed us with strength. As believers, should we not stand firm in our faith instead of turning tail and running?"



"Let's not argue," Maine tapped his scepter, "El and Heather have worked together for more than a decade and have also picked up the habit of speaking their minds. Looking at these two, he couldn't help but think of the old partners, Tefren and Heather. Turning to the old bishop, he found that the latter was also looking at him, seemingly thinking of the same scene. "Our ultimate goal is the continuation of mankind, and to achieve this goal, there is no other way but to defeat the enemy."



"Yes, Your Eminence," the two bowed their heads respectfully.



But he himself was not sure whether they could really defeat the devil by holding their ground at Hermes.



Thinking of Oberline's entrustment, Maine felt the weight on his shoulders.



The hell beasts have appeared, and in five years the devils will sweep over. He will witness this Divine Will battle in his lifetime and, unlike Oberline, cannot entrust the task to a successor. Every time he thought about this, it made him restless.



In fact, he had also thought of leaving a way out for himself. After swallowing Grace's Black Sail fleet, he did not order the ships to be burned, but had all the rebels imprisoned. Apart from a few leaders and a large number of scapegoats from the slums being executed, most of the sailors are now held in the Eternal Winter Harbor, guarded by his most reliable men.



If the defense lines were to collapse completely, the fjord would be the last refuge—even if retreating to the Strait Islands meant lingering on with the last breath, without ever having the chance to turn the tables, at least he could live out the rest of his life.



After all, humanity had already tried their utmost twice and still failed to defeat the opponent, hadn't they?



The subsequent discussion on how the Church should develop and consolidate the rule of Wolfheart, Mayne did not listen to much. When the three finished discussing, he absentmindedly responded, "Let’s do as you say, the meeting is adjourned for today."

"By your command, Your Holiness," the three bishops stood up and bowed in respect.

Mayne left the secret chamber, accompanied by the guards, and headed towards the Arcane Area.

According to the plan, today a new batch of the Judgement Army would be transformed into the God's Punishment Army, which was his main concern. Whether it was to hold the ground or retreat, these powerful warriors were the biggest guarantee of his commands being carried out.

But before that, he had an additional trouble to deal with.

Stepping up the stone stairs, Mayne entered the Arcane Institution and turned into the prison corridor located in the middle of the institution. The last time he came here was to secretly execute the King of Greycastle, Wimbledon III.

The corridor was still gloomy and deserted, the burning pine resin torches on both sides emitted a dim and dull light, and the end of the walkway was a dark abyss, as if it were the entrance to a bottomless pit. Many people, once imprisoned here, could never leave until their death.

Mayne walked to cell number eighty-five and signaled the guard to open the prison door.

The thick wooden door made a piercing friction noise, stirring up a wave of wails and cries in this land of death, but as the prison door closed again, all the sounds of lament were isolated outside.



Through the iron bars, he saw the figure of Zero.

The Pure One was facing away from the entrance, her upper body naked, her hands shackled to the iron bar above her head, having to stand on tiptoes to barely touch the ground. Her fair back was marred with dozens of fresh, red whip marks, the blood that had flowed down already coagulating.

"How do you find the taste of the Adjudication Whip?" Mayne asked, "I hope this teaches you the meaning of obedience."

"Umm..." Zero groaned softly, as if awakening from a dream, and turned her head slightly, "So it is His Holiness the Pope who has come. When you speak of obedience, do you mean obedience to you, or should I maintain a respectful attitude toward the other bishops as well?"

Her somewhat flippant tone made Mayne's brows furrow, but remembering that he was now the Pope and no longer merely a bishop, he suppressed the displeasure in his heart. After this punishment, she should understand that he now held the power of life and death over her, "You will obey my commands. When I ask you to assist other bishops with their tasks, you must also follow their orders."

"Is that so?" she said noncommittally, "Since you demand it, I shall comply."

"Unshackle her hands," Mayne ordered the guard.

After being suspended for a long time, her hands were nearly dislocated and dangled limply, seemingly without any strength. The Pope used his staff to pick up her clothes and threw them over her shoulder, "I have a task for you to undertake, follow me."

Zero let her clothes drape in front of her, indifferent, and followed him out of the prison corridor.



"This year, the Evil Months are likely to last for five months, which is a tremendous challenge for the Holy City, and even more so for other places affected by the Evil Months," Mayne walked to the end of the mechanism area, passed through the narrow iron-walled corridor, and once again came to the front of the lifting cage—since his coronation as Pope, he had been busy with various church affairs, and now he was stepping into this place for the first time as the ruler. "I order you and the other Purifiers to go to the Kingdom of Graycastle, and take advantage of the chaos brought by this heavy snow to eradicate the rebels Timothy Wimbledon and Roland Wimbledon. Do you understand?"



The door of the cage closed, and the sound of the winch turning came from above, the cage began to slowly descend, but he did not hear a response from the other party.



Damn it, it seems that the whipping had not taught her to behave, Mayne turned around with a stern face, only to see Agatha lift the corner of her mouth, her eyes flashing with dangerous light.



Then a pale light rushed straight towards him.
