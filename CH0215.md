## Skeleton Finger
Theo was led to a small room on the second floor of the tavern, where the burly man instructed the waiter to continue cleaning and then closed the door.



This place was meant for entertaining customers with special needs, charging only twenty-five bronze royals for a night, so the environment was far from elegant. The narrow bed reeked of mildew, the bedding was wrinkled as if it had not been washed for a long time. The wooden table, full of cracks and missing a corner, was stuffed with black fluff, making the table surface greasy and dirty. However, Theo was too tired to care. He sat down on the edge of the bed and quietly waited for the other party to speak.



"It's been a long time," the burly man grinned, "since Lord Nagy replaced your position, you stopped coming to the tavern? Even if you're no longer in charge of that matter, you could still come for a drink."



His nickname was Black Hammer, the keeper of "The Underhand" tavern, a member of the Skeleton Finger. It sounded scary, but he was just one of the many rats in the capital's underworld. The rats formed gangs and divided territories, creating large yet loose organizations based on their lines of business. These underground organizations were more or less backed by nobles or wealthy merchants, and Skeleton Finger was no exception. Unlike house dogs, however, most rats did not pledge loyalty to any one person; they would do jobs for anyone, as long as there was profit in it.



"Cut the nonsense," Theo said bluntly, "call Sylvie, Pigman, Silver Ring, and Pot tonight to the tavern. I have something to arrange."



"These are all people from The Underhand," Black Hammer paused, "Just them will be enough?"



"I said it's a good deal," he shrugged, "I came to you specifically because you've done many things for me in the past."



Normally, when dealing with the underworld, one would first need to find a middleman, who then decides whether to take on the task. Once both parties agree, the middleman assigns the task to the right people and collects a fee. Of course, there are no contracts or written proofs to guarantee the outcome, and whether the employer's expectations are met is entirely uncertain. Generally, the more reputable the organization, the more they care about their reputation and the higher the commission fee; newer organizations charge less but often result in both money and efforts wasted. These rats and the City Patrol maintained a delicate balance, together preserving the apparent order of the capital.



Before entering the palace to become a royal guard, Theo had worked in the patrol, responsible for handing over some matters that couldn't be publicized to the various organizations of the underworld. Therefore, he was very clear about the most powerful rat gangs in the capital, saving him the time to deal with middlemen. As for choosing Skeleton Finger, it was simply because they weren't completely rotten.



"May I ask, who are you working for now?" Black Hammer hesitated for a moment before asking.

Theo did not answer, but instead extended his thumb and pointed towards the direction of the palace behind him.

Be it the patrol team or the rats, most people only knew that he had become a member of the Guards, but were not aware that he was soon selected by His Majesty, King Wimbledon III, to be one of the personal guards of the Fourth Prince, accompanying Prince Roland to Border Town. During the half year of his absence, they probably thought he had always stayed within the palace. Besides, he was just pointing in the direction of the palace, not lying—after all, the royal family consisted of more than just Timothy; Roland Wimbledon was also a member of the royal family.

"I understand," he nodded, "but Hill Fawkes and the swineherd are no longer here, can I pick my own men?"

"What happened to them?"

"They're dead." Black Hammer said bitterly, "Last winter, there was a conflict with the people from Dreamland Water. They were selling poppies and Sleepy Fern into the North District territory, and the Kasasians chased them back. Hill Fawkes's throat was slit, and the blood simply wouldn't stop; the swineherd was dumped into the canal."

Theo frowned. Such matters were of no concern to the patrol team; they would even deliberately provoke infighting among the rats from time to time, in order to control their strength and numbers. As for the dead, nobody cared. "That'll do, but remember, they must be people from the tavern."

...

After leaving the Underground Signalman, Theo took a deep breath.



The rotten and damp smell in the tavern made him feel a bit nauseous until the hot air rushed into his lungs, slightly dispelling the murky and suffocating sensation.



Although Black Hammer cordially invited him to wait in the tavern, even claiming to offer him fine wine, Theo was not willing to stay in such a confined space for too long. If something unexpected happened, he wouldn't be able to detect it promptly.



Next, he decided to head to the inner city area to find a reliable inn and book a room for the night. As for the First Army soldiers, they were quite adept at setting up camp at night and did not require his concern.



After nightfall, Theo returned to The Underworld Tavern.



By this time, the tavern was open for business as usual, with customers coming and going intermittently. He first observed in the shadows for a while before following a patron into the building.



As a low-end tavern in the outer city area, the patrons here were mostly commoners, and the drinks were cheap, inferior barley beer—ten bronze royals could buy several large bowls. Amidst the noisy crowd, he quickly located Black Hammer's men. They were sitting around a partition by the wall, with a white phalanx bone placed on the table beside them.



Theo walked over without drawing attention, and someone immediately made room for him.



"Good evening, sir," Silver Ring and Pot nodded in greeting.



"Let me introduce the two of them to you. This is Little Finger," Black Hammer patted the little one beside him, then pointed to the young man next to her, "Hill Fox, who recently joined the Skeleton Finger."



"Fox?" Theo's gaze rested on the other party, who appeared somewhat restrained as he bowed his head in greeting.



"In our line of work, it's rare to find someone with a full surname," Black Hammer laughed heartily. "He gambled away everything, his wife ran off with someone else, and he even sold his house. He had no choice but to turn to the back streets. Don't worry, he used to live in the North District and would occasionally patronize the underground Hornblower."



Silver Ring and the clay pot were old acquaintances. Little Finger looked no different from the ordinary street urchin, but this Hill Fox, Theo found somewhat strange... His appearance and demeanor indeed resembled that of a lost soul who had become exhausted after a drastic change, but there was something indescribable in his eyes, as if... he pondered but ultimately couldn't come up with a precise answer.



Well, since he lived in the North District and was a familiar face in the tavern, there shouldn't be any problems. Besides, the first task he had to complete was the transport of refugees, which bore no risk.



"Listen up, the matter is not complex. The higher-ups don't want to see the number of refugees from the Eastern Region increasing anymore. The food for relief is decreasing every day. If this continues, riots will happen sooner or later, and they will be much more difficult to handle. So, we need to find a way to get them out of King's City."



"What do you need us to do?" Black Hammer asked.



"It's simple. Spread a rumor that the Western Region is reclaiming wasteland, and the local lord is willing to accept these refugees. The escort mercenaries and the fleet have already set sail and will arrive at the canal wharf in three days. What you need to do is to spread this news to those fools outside the city. You can freely add specific details to make it sound as real as possible."



"But... if the mercenaries and fleet don't show up in the end, no matter how real it sounds, it's useless," Silver Ring said.



"Of course, they will be there," Theo smiled.



"Ah?" He was startled, "Is there really a Western Region lord willing to take them in?"

"You fool," Black Hammer gave him a slap on the back of his head, "If we're putting on a play, we have to do the whole set. After being shipped to the Western Region, do you think they can just walk back to the king's city on their two legs? As for how to deal with them, let the local lords worry about that." He looked towards Theo, "It's not exactly a difficult task, but as for the payment..."

Theo held up two fingers, "Double. My new employer is not like the patrol team; he wants to see results as soon as possible. Gold royals mean little to him." He smiled faintly, "I've said it before, this is a good deal."
