## Skeleton Fingers
Bringing Tassa to a small room on the second floor of the tavern, the burly man instructed the tavern waiter to continue cleaning and then closed the door.



This place was for entertaining customers with special needs, charging only twenty-five bronze royals for a night, so the environment was nothing fancy. The narrow bed reeked of mildew, and the bedding was wrinkled, as if it hadn't been washed and aired out for a long time. The wooden table, filled with cracks and missing a corner, was stuffed with black fluff, making its surface greasy and dirty. However, Tassa was too tired to care. He sat down on the edge of the bed and quietly waited for the other party to speak.



"It's been a long time," the burly man grinned, "Ever since Lord Nage replaced you, why have you stopped coming to the tavern? Even if you're no longer in charge, you could still come for a drink."



His nickname was Black Hammer, the keeper of the "Underground Whistle" tavern, a member of the Skeleton Fingers. It sounded menacing, but he was just one of the many rats in the capital's underworld. The rats formed gangs, divided territories, and formed large but loose organizations based on their businesses. These underground organizations were more or less backed by nobles or wealthy businessmen, and the Skeleton Fingers were no exception. Unlike domesticated dogs, however, most rats did not pledge loyalty to anyone in particular; they would work for anyone if there was profit to be made.



"Cut the crap," Tassa said bluntly, "Call over Hill, Swineherd, Silver Ring, and Pot tonight, right here in this tavern. I have something to arrange."



"These are all people from the Underground Whistle," Black Hammer hesitated, "Just them will be enough?"



"I told you, this is a good deal." He shrugged, "I came to you specifically because you've done quite a few things for me in the past."



To deal with the black street, one would typically find a contact person first, who would then decide whether to take on the task. Once an agreement was reached, the contact person would entrust the task to suitable candidates and collect a fee. Of course, there was no contract or written proof to guarantee the process, and whether the employer's expectations would ultimately be met was entirely uncertain. Generally, the more reputable the organization, the more they cared about their reputation and the higher their commission fee. Newcomers charged less, but there was a risk of losing both money and results. These rats and the city patrol maintained a delicate balance, together upholding the apparent order of the capital.



Before entering the palace to become a court guard, Tassa had served in the patrol team, responsible for handing over some shady affairs to the various organizations of the black street. Therefore, he was well aware of the largest rat communities in the capital, saving time dealing with contacts. As for choosing the Skeleton Fingers, it was simply because they weren't completely rotten yet.



"May I ask, who are you working for now?" Black Hammer hesitated for a moment before asking.

Tassa did not answer, but instead, he thumbed toward the direction of the palace behind him.

Whether it was the patrol team or the rats, most people only knew that he had become a guard, but they didn't know that he was soon picked by His Majesty, King Wimbledon III, to be one of the personal guards of the Fourth Prince, following Prince Roland to Border Town. During the half-year he was gone, they probably thought he stayed in the palace the whole time. Besides, he was just pointing in the direction of the palace, which wasn't lyingâ€”after all, the royal family wasn't just Timothy; Roland Wimbledon was also a member of the royal household.

"I see," he nodded, "but Silver and the swineherd are no longer around, can I pick my own subordinates?"

"What happened to them?"

"They're dead," Black Hammer said bitterly. "Last winter, they got into a conflict with the people from Dreamwater. They brought poppy flowers and Sleepy Fern to the turf in the northern district, and Kasas led the guys to chase them back. Silver got her throat slashed, and the blood wouldn't stop; the swineherd was dumped into the canal."

Tassa frowned; the patrol team wouldn't care about such things. They even deliberately incited fights among the rats from time to time to control their power and numbers. As for those who died, no one would care. "That's fine, but remember, it must be someone from the tavern."

...

After leaving the Underground Whistler, Tassa took a deep breath.



The musty, damp smell of the tavern made him feel nauseous until the hot air surged into his lungs, which somewhat dispelled the murky and oppressive feeling.



Although Black Hammer warmly invited him to wait in the tavern, even claiming to serve him fine wine, Tassa was unwilling to stay in such a cramped place for too long. If something unexpected happened, he wouldn't be able to detect it immediately.



Next, he decided to head to the inner city to find a reliable inn to book a room for the night. As for the First Army soldiers, they were already proficient in setting up camp for the night and didn't require his concern.



After nightfall, Tassa returned to the Underground Hornblower.



By this time, the tavern was operating normally, with customers coming and going intermittently. He observed from a dark corner for a while before following a patron inside.



As a low-grade tavern in the outer city district, most of the customers were commoners, and the drinks were cheap, poor-quality barley beer; ten bronze royals could buy several large bowls. Amidst the noisy crowd, he quickly located Black Hammer's men, who were sitting around a partition by the wall, with a white phalanx bone placed on the table beside them.



Tassa walked over without drawing attention, and someone immediately made room for him.



"Good evening, my lord," said Silver Ring and Pot, nodding in greeting.



"Let me introduce these two to you; this is Littlefinger," Black Hammer patted the little one beside him, then pointed to the young man next to her, "Hill Fawkes, who recently joined the Skeleton Finger."



"Folks?" Tassa's gaze rested on the other person, who appeared somewhat restrained as he bowed his head in greeting.

"In our line of work, it's rare to find a guy with a complete surname," Black Hammer laughed, "He gambled away everything, his wife ran off with someone else, he even sold his house, and had no choice but to take to the black streets. Don't worry, he used to live in the North District and would occasionally patronize the underground signaller."

The Silver Ring and the clay pot were old acquaintances, and the Little Finger looked no different from an ordinary vagabond, but this Hill Fawkes, Tassa found somewhat strange... His appearance and expression indeed resembled that of a lost soul who had become exhausted after suffering a great upheaval, but there was something in his eyes that was indescribable, like... He thought about it but ultimately couldn't come up with an exact answer.

Well, since he lived in the North District and was a familiar face at the tavern, there should be no problem. Moreover, the first task he had to complete was to transport refugees, which posed no risk at all.

"Listen up, the matter is not complicated. The higher-ups don't want to see the number of refugees from the Eastern Region continue to increase, the grain for relief is diminishing every day, if this continues, a riot will inevitably happen sooner or later, and it will be much more troublesome to deal with, so we need to find a way to get them out of the Royal Capital."

"What do you need us to do?" Black Hammer asked.

"Quite simple, spread a message that the Western Region is cultivating wasteland, the local lord is willing to accept these refugees, and the escorting mercenaries and fleet have already set sail, and will arrive at the canal wharf in three days. What you need to do is to spread this message to those fools outside the city, you can freely add specific details, the more real it sounds the better."

"But... if there are no mercenaries or fleet arriving, no matter how real it sounds, it's no use," said Silver Ring.

"Of course, there will be some," Tassa smiled.



"Ah?" He was taken aback, "Could there really be a lord in the Western Region willing to take them in?"

"You fool," Black Hammer slapped the back of his head, "Of course, the act must be played out in full. After being transported to the Western Region, do you think they can walk back to the capital on their own two legs? As for how to deal with them, let the local lords worry about that." He looked towards Tassa, "It's indeed not a difficult task, but as for the payment..."

Tassa held up two fingers, "Double. My new employer is not like the patrol team; he wants to see results as soon as possible, and gold royals mean little to him." He smiled slightly, "I've said it before, this is a good deal."
