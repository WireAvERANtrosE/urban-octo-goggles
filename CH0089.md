## Celebration (Part 1)
This year's Border Town was extraordinarily different from previous years.



In past years, after the Evil Months ended, one would have to wait another month in the slums of Longsong Stronghold until the snow had completely melted before embarking on the journey home. Upon returning to the town, what one would mostly see was a scene of devastation. Houses that had been unattended for months were in ruins, some flimsy wooden huts had already been crushed by the heavy snow, and in some townspeople's homes, there might even be demonic beasts hiding. These creatures had gnawed the cupboards and tables into a mess and dragged in straw and torn rags to fill the corners, clearly having turned these places that provided shelter from the wind and snow into their own dens. The residents usually spent a week repairing their homes and replacing waterlogged, moldy furniture, and as for the lingering stench of decay, the locals were accustomed to it.



However, this year, Border Town was completely rejuvenated. The snow was quickly swept away, and colorful paper flags distributed by His Highness the Prince were hung at the entrances of homes. From a distance, the monotonous and decrepit town became vibrant with colors, the various flags mixing together like a sea of flowers. Everyone spread the word that on the first day after the Evil Months ended, His Highness would hold a grand celebration dance in the square! Anyone could attend, not only was there no need to pay, but there was also free food!



What was a dance? It was a social gathering that only the upper nobility could attend. Everyone had only ever heard about it from the well-traveled merchants in the big cities, but even they could not participate. The merchants said that it was not an event where an invitation could be obtained just by having money. His Highness was actually letting everyone join?



"Your Highness, doing this might not be a good idea," the Chief Knight advised. "There's no band here, nor a lead dancer. Who will control the rhythm of the dance? Besides, in such a remote place, not even the nobles may know how to dance, let alone your subjects who'll just mess everything up."



Carter had only been to a dance once when he was in the capital, held by a marquis to celebrate his daughter's birthday. The elegant strings and spirited drumbeats alternated, with the ladies dancing gracefully to the music, and the gentlemen showing their quick and powerful dance steps when the drums sounded, either spinning or tapping their feet, matching their moves with the drumbeats. During the breaks, attendants weaved through the crowd with drinks and snacks, and the gentlemen would look for a lady they admired. When the last piece of music was played, they would muster the courage to invite her for a dance, and those who succeeded would enjoy a romantic time after the dance dispersed.



Carter sighed. Although his younger self had not managed to invite the girl he admired, the elegant and romantic atmosphere of that time was still memorable to him. Replace the distinguished nobles with these villagers who dealt with rocks and beasts every day? My goodness, he could hardly imagine such a scene.



"Lead dancer? Of course, we have one," Roland ordered the militia to dismantle all the stone sculptures and gallows in the square. "Iron Axe and the militia will do."



"That Sand People?" Carter was stunned. As the captain of the gun squad, Iron Axe had gained the Chief Knight's recognition for his performance during the Evil Months, and his foreign title was no longer mentioned. However, he was still a Mojin tribesman at the end of the day, how could he possibly know the etiquette of the mainland kingdoms!



Roland smiled mysteriously: "Because the ball I'm going to hold isn't the usual kind of ball, you'll know when the time comes."



The preparations weren't too numerous, mainly involving the removal of obstacles in the square, and then piling up a heap of firewood in the center. A table was built around the edge of the firewood pile with bricks, to be used for barbecuing food. That's right, this was the celebration ball that Roland came up with on a whimâ€”a mix of a bonfire party and an outdoor barbecue.



What could increase the people's sense of belonging to their place of residence was a question the prince had seriously considered. Nationalism and patriotism were too profound for these rural villagers who had worked for their lords all their lives and were illiterate. Only their family wealth and relatives were worth caring about. The more backward a society, the more shortsighted it is, a rule of the development of civilization, "Civilization will ultimately become as great as its ideas," and Roland deeply agreed with this.



However, this did not mean that spiritual construction could be ignored. The Victory Celebration was one of the reform methods he had contemplated. In fact, he found it hard to understand why there were no celebrations in this world after surviving the Evil Months. The yearly invasions of demonic beasts were just like natural disasters, and overcoming such evil was naturally an event worth recording in history.



Therefore, he decided to name the first day after the Evil Months each year as Victory Day. In all the territories that belonged to him, not only would this day be a public holiday, but various celebration activities would also be held. As long as it continued for three to four years, it would become a tradition, passed down in the territory. Gradually, the people would also feel that they were indeed different from those living under other lords.



By noon, the square was already packed with people, with the militia members forming a circle, keeping everyone outside of the firewood pile.



It seems that giving away free food is still quite attractive; at least half the town's people had come, Roland thought. The only downside was that the square was ultimately too small. Apart from the space around the firewood pile, the crowd of over a thousand people was almost shoulder to shoulder, making it difficult to move around. He also saw some children who had climbed up to the nearest roofs to look towards the center of the square.



The first celebration is bound to have its imperfections. Roland estimated that the time was about right and took the stage to give a speech.



This was his second time giving a public speech in the square, and he felt much more composed than the last time.



"My subjects, good afternoon. I am Roland Wimbledon, the Fourth Prince of the Kingdom of Greycastle." He chose the same opening as last time, but this time the effect was completely different. Before his words even finished, there were already bursts of enthusiastic cheers from the crowd, "Long live Prince Roland!" "Long live His Highness!"



Roland immediately felt warmth in his chest; this time, he hadn't arranged for any shills. Seeing the spontaneous cheers of the militia and the people, he was filled with a sense of achievement and satisfaction.



As the cheers subsided a bit, he gestured for the crowd to calm down, "The Evil Months have ended. Thanks to the brave fight of the militia, the demonic beasts have not been able to cross the city walls. Border Town has defeated the terrible enemy at a minimal cost, proving that as long as we unite, even without relying on the charity of Longsong Stronghold, we can stand our ground here! They wanted to use food to threaten the town, to force us to submit with hunger and cold, but today's victory tells them that all their efforts are in vain!"



"That's right, I never want to go back to that place again!"



"With Prince Roland, there's not a single day of hunger in the winter!"



"We no longer have to endure their extortion, His Highness is merciful!"



Roland took advantage of the ever-increasing enthusiasm of the crowd and continued to speak loudly, "Let us celebrate this glorious and honorable victory, a day that deserves to be remembered! I declare that from now on, the first day after the Evil Months will be known as 'Victory Day'! The celebration ball is set for this very occasion! My subjects, enjoy this day to the fullest! Now, let the ball begin!"



Torches were thrown into the piles of greased wood, and with a 'whoosh', the flames rose, instantly igniting the atmosphere of the entire square.
