## Exploring the Stone Tower Again
Seeing Prince His Highness leave, Lightning pulled Maggie to a corner of the hall.

"Hoot?"

Her hair almost touched the ground, moving like a floating ghost. Pushing the white hair blocking her cheeks aside, Maggie's cheeks puffed out, with half a piece of pork chop cartilage still in her mouth.



"I found an interesting place," Lightning whispered, "right in the Misty Forest. I'm planning to go on an adventure tomorrow, do you want to come with me?"

"Gurgle." Maggie swallowed her food and nodded repeatedly, "Sure, sure, what should we prepare?"



"The three most essential things for an adventure... No, that's not right," Lightning realized she sometimes used the strange phrases that Roland His Highness often used, "a flint, provisions, and a dagger. It's not far, so one day's worth of food should be enough. Don't pack your pockets full like last time."



"Okay hoot." Maggie patted her chest and was about to leave when Lightning stopped her again.



"Remember, this adventure is our secret, don't tell anyone else," the little girl instructed, "We'll set off early tomorrow."



Watching Maggie's eager figure head back toward the dining table, she pursed her lips and began thinking about the plans for tomorrow.



Despite the success of her bombing run, which met His Highness's expectations, she found that her flight was no longer as agile as before, as if something was restraining her movements. Whenever she picked up speed, Lightning felt as if a devil was always chasing her from behind.



It was an obstacle brought about by fear, she realized, stemming from that trip to the stone tower. After seeing the horrifying figure at the entrance of the basement, she lost her calm and composure, only thinking about fleeing the place as quickly as possible. Since then, she had begun to doubt her identity as an explorer.



"Fear is not to be feared, what's fearsome is the unknown. To overcome it, one must first approach it."



Lightning silently recited her father's teaching to herself. Tomorrow, she might encounter real danger, but an explorer should not fear danger, much less shrink back. If she couldn't overcome this, she feared that she would have difficulty flying freely in the future.



This was also why Lightning decided to act on her own, concealing her plans from Roland. According to His Highness's plan, the exploration of the stone tower was scheduled after the Evil Months, and by then, the First Army and a team of witches would be dispatched to go together. She worried that by then, even if she visited the stone tower again, it would be difficult to entertain the thought of "conquering fear"—approaching danger only with the encouragement of others could hardly be called an adventure.



His Highness might scold her later, confiscate her ice cream, and the sisters of the Witch Union would worry, but she was still determined.



As the daughter of Thunder, the greatest explorer of the Fjords, Lightning could not accept a cowardly version of herself.



However, this decision did not mean acting recklessly. Compared to her unprepared self a few months ago, she now had a revolver given by His Highness, a better understanding of devils, and the company of Maggie.



Especially the last point... if they really encountered a group of devils in the tower, even if Maggie couldn't transform into a demonic beast to drive off the enemy, at the very least, she could still carry her away.



Explorers do not need a large group of people to embolden themselves, she thought, but they can have a few trustworthy teammates.

After the banquet, Lightning packed the accumulated honey-grilled meat slices into her cloth pouch, followed by weapons, torches, and water bags.

Successfully completing the bombing mission had restored some of her confidence, and the Prince's encouragement and his slightly stubbled cheeks also greatly bolstered her courage. Strike while the iron is hot; tomorrow would be the best time to set out.

Early in the morning, she flew to the top of the castle, where Maggie was squatting on the wall waiting for her.

"Check your pack."

"I brought everything you told me to, coo." She reverted to her original form and opened the backpack slung across her waist for the little girl to inspect. This time, the food inside had been reduced from a full pouch to half, but at least a dagger and a fire sickle were stuffed in.

"Alright, you pass this time... Let's set off." Lightning took to the sky, flying with the pigeon towards the direction of the Misty Forest.

...

This journey had been repeated many times in Lightning's mind; she could find her way even with her eyes closed. The weather today was slightly overcast but much better than the last time when it was covered with dark clouds. The patches of color that made up the earth slowly moved backward, and the closer she got to the stone tower area, the more nervous Lightning became.



"Was the interesting place you mentioned last night the new Eagle's Nest?" Maggie asked.

"No, it's much more interesting than that," Lightning shook her head, "Our target is an ancient ruin, a stone tower left over from more than four hundred years ago. The basement has not collapsed; we might be able to find some old books describing the situation at the time."

"Old books?" Maggie flapped her wings, "That doesn't sound as fun as taking eagle eggs, coo."

"A nest has at most two or three eggs; they'd be gone after a few bites," the young girl coaxed persuasively, "If we really find such books and bring them back to Lord Roland, he'd surely reward you with a basket of eggs, boiled or steamed, all yours. You could eat three a day for quite a long time."

"Really?" Maggie perked up immediately, "Then let's hurry and look for the ancient books! Coo coo!"

By noon, the two arrived safely above their destination.

The stone tower, half-covered in vines and moss, still stood erect in the forest, everything around it looked the same as it had a few months ago, without any change. Lightning lowered her altitude, circling the tower to ensure safety before landing gently.

"Is this the place, coo?" the pigeon squawked from atop her head.

"Shh—" Lightning made a silencing gesture, their voices seemed particularly loud in the quiet forest, "Speak softly, there could be devils here."



"A devil?" Maggie's tail immediately stood erect.



"You wait up there for me," she pointed at the top of the broken tower and lowered her voice, "I'll go scout ahead."



Stepping on the increasingly withered grass, her footsteps made a slight rustling sound. The entrance to the stone tower wasn't overgrown again, and Lightning could still see the small cluster of vines that she had cut with her dagger last time. Holding her breath, she followed the same route into the tower, inching closer to the central underground chamber entrance. Looking at the stairs plunging into the darkness, she could even hear her own thumping heartbeat.



Fear comes from the unknown, to overcome fear is to approach the unknown... The young girl kept encouraging herself in her heart, lighting a torch and descending the stairs step by step.



Reaching the corner of the passageway, she cautiously peeked out; the collapsed wooden door was already shattered, and the entrance to the basement was devoid of the devil's figure, leaving only the profound darkness behind the door, like a gaping maw choosing its next victim.



It was then that she heard a faint sound drifting from the darkness, almost imperceptible, yet incredibly familiar—



Lightning couldn't help but shiver, her body hair standing on end in an instant, almost unable to resist the urge to turn and flee! She clenched her teeth tightly, forcefully suppressing the fear welling up from within, covering her mouth, and once again she listened intently.



This time, the cry for help was much clearer, and the tone was exactly the same as last time.



"Save me..."
