## Exploring the Stone Tower Again
Upon seeing Prince Roland leave, Lightning pulled Maggie into a corner of the hall.

"Hoot?"

Her hair was almost dragging on the ground, moving like a floating ghost. Pushing aside the white hair blocking her cheeks, Maggie's cheeks were puffed high, with half a piece of crispy pork chop bone still in her mouth.

"I've discovered an interesting place," Lightning whispered, "right in the Misty Forest. I plan to go on an adventure there tomorrow. Do you want to come with me?"

"Gurgle." Maggie swallowed the food in her mouth and nodded repeatedly, "Sure, sure, what should we prepare?"

"The three essentials for an adventure... no, the three most commonly used items," Lightning realized she occasionally blurted out strange phrases that Prince Roland was fond of using, "a fire scythe, provisions, and a dagger. It's not far, so just enough food for one day should be sufficient. Don't pack your pockets full like last time."

"Okay, hoot." Maggie patted her chest and was about to leave when Lightning stopped her again.

"Remember, this adventure is our secret. Don't tell anyone else," the young girl instructed, "We'll set off early tomorrow morning."

Watching Maggie's eager figure hustle back toward the dining table, she pursed her lips and began to think about the plans for the next day.



Although the bombing was successful and did not disappoint His Highness's expectations, she found that her flying was no longer as nimble as before, as if something was binding her actions. As soon as she picked up speed, Lightning felt as if a devil was always chasing her from behind.



This was an obstacle brought on by fear, she realized, originating from that trip to the Stone Tower. After seeing the terrifying figure at the entrance to the basement, she lost her calm and composure, only thinking of escaping the place as quickly as possible. Since then, she had begun to doubt her identity as an explorer.



"Fear is not terrible; what's terrible is the unknown. To overcome it, you must first approach it."



Lightning silently recited her father's teaching to herself. Tomorrow, she might encounter real danger, but an explorer should not be afraid of danger, nor should they shy away. If she couldn't overcome this, she feared that it would be difficult for her to fly freely again in the future.



This was also why Lightning decided to act on her own without telling Prince Roland. According to His Highness's plan, the exploration of the Stone Tower would be arranged after the Evil Months, and by then, the First Army and the Witch Union would be dispatched to go together. She worried that by that time, even if she visited the Stone Tower again, it would be difficult to have the thought of "conquering fear"—relying on everyone's courage to approach danger was not truly exploring.



His Highness might scold her for this later, confiscate her ice cream, and the sisters of the Witch Union might worry, but she was still determined.



As the daughter of Thunder, the greatest explorer of the Fjords, Lightning could not accept a cowardly version of herself.



However, this decision did not equate to recklessness. Compared to her unpreparedness a few months ago, she now had the revolver gifted by His Highness, a better understanding of devils, and the company of Maggie by her side.



Especially the latter... If she really encountered a group of devils in the tower, even if Maggie couldn't transform into a demonic beast to drive the enemy away, she could at least carry her to escape.



Explorers do not need a large group of people to embolden themselves, she thought, but they can have a few trustworthy teammates.

After the banquet, Lightning packed the accumulated honey-grilled meat slices into a cloth bag, followed by weapons, torches, and a water bladder.

Successfully completing the bombing mission had restored some of her confidence, and His Highness's encouragement and his slightly stubbled cheeks also greatly bolstered her courage. Strike while the iron is hot; tomorrow would be the best time to set off.

Early in the morning, she flew to the top of the castle, where Maggie was squatting on the wall waiting for her.

"Check your pack."

"I've brought everything you asked for, coo." She returned to her original form and opened the backpack slung across her waist for the little girl to inspect. This time, the food in the pack was reduced to half, but at least a dagger and a flint sickle were stuffed in.

"Alright, you pass this time... Let's set off." Lightning took to the sky, flying with the pigeon towards the direction of the Misty Forest.

...

This journey had been repeated many times in Lightning's mind; she could find her direction even with her eyes closed. The weather today was slightly overcast, but it was much better than the last time with its dense clouds. The patches of color that made up the earth slowly moved backward, and the closer she got to the stone tower area, the more nervous Lightning became.



"Is the interesting place you mentioned last night the new Eagle's Nest?" Maggie asked.



"No, it's much more interesting than that," Lightning shook her head, "Our target for exploration is an ancient ruin, a stone tower left over from more than four hundred years ago. The basement has not collapsed, and we might be able to find some ancient books that describe the situation at that time."



"Ancient books?" Maggie fluttered her wings, "That sounds less fun than raiding eagle eggs, coo."



"There are at most two or three eggs in an eagle's nest, and they're gone after a few bites," the young girl said persuasively, "If we really can find such books and bring them back to Lord Roland, he would surely reward you with a basket of chicken eggs. You can have them boiled or steamed, any way you like, and if you eat three a day, it would last a long time."



"Really?" Maggie's spirits were immediately lifted, "Then let's hurry and look for the ancient books, coo coo!"



By nearly noon, the two of them had successfully arrived above their destination.



The stone tower, half-covered by vines and moss, still stood erect in the forest, and everything around it looked the same as it had several months ago, with no changes. Lightning lowered her altitude, circling around the stone tower to ensure it was safe before gently landing.



"Is this the place, coo?" the pigeon asked, perched on her head.



"Shh—" Lightning made a silencing gesture, "Speak softly. There might be devils here."



"Devil?" Maggie's tail immediately stood on end.

"You wait for me up there," she pointed to the top of the broken tower, lowering her voice, "I'll go scout the situation first."

Stepping on the gradually withering grass, a slight rustling sound came from beneath her feet. The entrance to the stone tower was not resealed by plants, and Lightning could still see the small cluster of vines she had cut with her dagger last time. She held her breath, followed the original path into the tower, inching closer to the central underground chamber's entrance. Looking at the staircase descending into darkness, she could even hear her own thudding heartbeat.

Fear comes from the unknown, to overcome fear is to approach the unknown... The little girl kept encouraging herself in her heart, lit a torch, and walked down the stairs step by step.

Reaching the corner of the passage, she cautiously peeked around. The collapsed wooden door was already shattered, and there was no sign of the devil at the entrance to the basement—only the profound darkness behind the door, like a gaping maw choosing its prey.

It was then that she heard a whisper floating from the darkness, faint yet incredibly familiar—

Lightning couldn't help but shiver, the hair on her body standing on end in an instant, almost uncontrollable urge to turn and flee! She clenched her teeth, forcibly suppressing the fear rising from the depths of her heart, covered her mouth, and listened again.

This time, the call was much clearer, and the tone was exactly the same as the last time.

"Save me..."
