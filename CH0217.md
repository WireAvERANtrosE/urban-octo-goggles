After Roland and the witches finished lunch and were preparing to go back to their rooms for a nap, Carter burst into the castle hall.

"Your Highness, the civilians from the Eastern Region brought from the King's City have arrived at the docks!"

"So soon?" It seems that Theo's efficiency in handling matters is quite high, he thought with satisfaction. It was indeed no loss to have someone who has served in the patrol team and had connections to both the lawful and the underworld. However, seeing the Chief Knight's sweat-drenched appearance and furrowed brows, Roland immediately felt that something was amiss.

"What's wrong?"

"However, the people on the ship have contracted a strange illness," Carter quickly described the symptoms of the patients, "It started with a few people, but now it has spread to two or three ships, and even the soldiers of the First Army have been infected!"

The patients developed black spots and could infect each other? It sounded very much like the plague, the infamous Black Death. But the plague bacillus couldn't make a person's blood change color, let alone cause their skin to crack open.

Roland's brow furrowed.

His first thought was of Lily, but he wasn't sure if her powers could deal with this unheard-of contagious disease, and it would be troublesome if she got infected while trying to cure it. He had to make a careful decision, but from Carter's description, these people would not last long.

Regardless, the first step was to at least quarantine the area.



Thinking of this, Roland ordered Carter, "Lead the First Army to move out, set up a cordon outside the dock, and forbid anyone from entering or leaving. At the same time, repeatedly tell them: I will arrive soon, and Miss Nana is already on her way."

"Yes!"

"Tricky?" Nightingale asked.

"It's not clear yet, it all depends on Lily's ability," he said gravely, "Gather all the members of the Witch Union, no naps this afternoon."

...

After much consideration, Roland felt that he had to maintain isolation from the patient until he could verify the effects of Lily's ability.

Fortunately, her preservation ability was of the summoning type; she didn't need to touch the target to produce an effect—the distance was about the same as the control distance for most witches, nearly five meters.

He then called over two carpenters and quickly set up a rectangular box-shaped room with Anna's help. There was a partition in the center of the room with a small glass window at the top, through which one could see the scene on the other side. Below the partition, there was a flexible curtain drawn by Soraya, with two symmetrical small holes that allowed Lily to extend her hands through. The soft sky-blue curtain would tightly wrap around the girl's hands, thereby isolating the airflow on both sides. As long as she washed her hands with alcohol after coming out, she should be able to avoid the possibility of infection.

The order at the dock was controlled by more than fifty soldiers of the First Army who were on the ship. They were able to maintain discipline in the face of the terrifying contagious disease not because their will was particularly strong, but because most of the soldiers believed that Miss Nana, like an angel, would surely heal them completely.



After the quarantine room was prepared, a soldier who could still walk on his own with black spots only on his arms was selected. 

He followed the instructions and entered the room, stood still, and Lily stretched her hand through the partition to use her ability. Roland stood by her side, observing the soldier's condition through the window. 

The influence of magic was silent and invisible. The young girl nodded her head to indicate completion, and then he asked, "How do you feel now?" 

"Your Highness, Prince Roland?" The soldier recognized Roland's voice, stood at attention, saluted excitedly, and then stood there astonished. "Eh, I feel like my strength has returned. My God, Your Highness, I feel so much better!" 

Roland could see it too— the black spots on his hands were retreating rapidly, and this was definitely not a symptom of the plague. If he remembered correctly, the black spots from the latter were due to concurrent septicemia and cyanosis, and even after the plague bacteria were killed, these spots would take a long time to fade. Lily didn't have the ability to revive muscles. 

However, her new ability did have a therapeutic effect on unknown diseases, which somewhat relieved Roland. 

"It's good that you've recovered. Go call the other soldiers. Ten people enter at a time. Regardless of whether symptoms are showing or not, everyone needs to be treated." 

"Yes, Your Highness," the soldier paused for a moment, then saluted again, "Thank you, Miss Nana." 

"It's not Nana, this time it's Miss Lily who saved your life," Roland corrected with a smile, "Only if it's serious enough that the skin has burst and is bleeding do you need Miss Nana to treat you."



"Is...is that so," he touched his head, "then thank you, Miss Lily."

After the soldier left, Lily glanced at the prince, "It's okay to credit it to Nana, I don't need to be thanked."

Oh, is that so? Then why were you standing so straight just now? Roland looked at her swaying twin ponytails and couldn't help but reach out and rub her head, and to his surprise, she did not protest but just hummed softly.



If it wasn't the plague, then what exactly was causing the illness? He walked out of the cabin, and Nightingale immediately came up to him, "Your Highness, I just saw a strange phenomenon, there are signs of magical power in the blood of those people."

"What?" Roland was stunned.

"It's like tiny sparks in the night within the mist," Nightingale affirmed, "I have never seen such faint glimmers of magical power."



This was indeed an unexpected discovery. Anything related to magic was either due to witches or connected to the Church. At least now it could be confirmed that this epidemic was not caused by natural bacteria or viruses.



"I see," the prince pondered for a moment, "in that case, let's draw some blood for observation."

"No, you might get infected!" she voiced out anxiously to stop him.



"Rest assured," Roland smiled at her, "Lily's new ability has completely suppressed the disease."



The blood sample was taken from a civilian who had fallen into a coma, and he embedded the glass slide smeared with black blood onto the stage and adjusted the objective distance. As the image in the lens gradually became clear—if the thing causing the symptoms was about the size of bacteria, it was likely that nothing would be seen. But the moment the focus overlapped with the target, Roland could hardly believe his own eyes.



Within the narrow field of view, several bugs with tentacles and swollen bellies were slowly swimming in the liquid, occasionally ejecting a stream of mucus, like thin strands of hair. They were about the size of single-celled algae, yet similar to the mother bodies created by Lily, their bodies were not transparent, and it was hard to determine whether they belonged to single-celled organisms.



Fortunately, the magical glow on the bugs' bodies did not affect the girl's ability to function. When blood mixed with replicators was dripped into the sample, the replicators would even preferentially attack these strange bugs, turning them into their own kind.



After all the First Army soldiers had recovered, to avoid any accidents, Roland ordered all refugees entering the shack to wear head covers and be led in by the soldiers. Another shack was also set up, primarily for Nana to treat those with severe illnesses and open wounds.



The treatment continued from noon until evening, and when all five hundred people from the ten boats had recovered, a thunderous cheer erupted from the crowd. Many people fell to their knees on the ground, shouting "Long live His Highness!" The waves of cheering went on and on, unable to subside for a long time.



"You don't seem very happy?" Nightingale winked at him.



"The ones who cured the plague are not me, but Lily and Nana, the witches," Roland shook his head, "They are the ones who should be receiving the cheers."



That being said, it was not wise to reveal the truth to the public before they fully accepted witches. He sighed softly, hoping that one day the witches could also stand in the spotlight.



Nightingale seemed to understand what was on Roland's mind, and she patted his shoulder generously. "No one will mind, you've already done well enough. Besides, this day was bound to come sooner or later, right?" She paused, "Oh, I forgot to tell you some good news."



"What is it?"



"The Witch Union might be gaining a new member soon," Nightingale said with a grin.
