## Pathogen
After Roland and the witches finished lunch and were about to return to their rooms for a nap, Carter burst into the castle hall.

"Your Highness, the eastern civilians transported from the capital have arrived at the docks!"

"So soon?" Roland thought with pleasure that Tassa's efficiency was quite high, befitting of someone who had served in the patrol team and had connections with both the underworld and the authorities. However, seeing his Chief Knight's sweaty appearance and furrowed brows, Roland immediately felt that something was amiss.

"What's wrong?"

"But the people on the ship have contracted a strange illness," Carter quickly described the symptoms of the sick, "It started with a few people, but now it has spread to two or three ships, and even the soldiers of the First Army are infected!"

Black spots on the sick and contagious? It sounded a lot like the plague, also known as the notorious Black Death. But the plague bacillus couldn't turn someone's blood black, let alone cause the skin to crack.

Roland's brow furrowed.

His first thought was of Lily, but he wasn't sure if her abilities could handle this unheard-of contagious disease, and if she couldn't cure it and became infected herself, that would be troublesome. He had to make a cautious decision, but from Carter's description, these people wouldn't last long.

Regardless, the scene had to be quarantined immediately.



Thinking of this, Roland ordered Carter, "Deploy the First Army and set up a warning zone outside the docks, prohibiting anyone from entering or leaving. And keep telling them: I will be there shortly, and Miss Nana is already on her way."

"Yes!"

"Tricky?" Nightingale asked.

"It's not clear yet, it all depends on Lily's ability," he said gravely. "Gather all the members of the Witch Union, no one is going to sleep this noon."

...

After further consideration, Roland felt that it was necessary to keep the patient isolated before verifying the effects of Lily's ability.

Fortunately, her preservation ability was a summoning type that did not require physical contact with the target to be effective—this distance was about the same as the control distance of most witches, roughly five meters.

He then summoned two carpenters and, with Anna's help, quickly erected a rectangular box-shaped room. In the center of the room was a partition with a small glass window at the top, allowing one to see the scene on the other side. Below the partition was a flexible curtain drawn by Soraya, with two small holes symmetrically placed, allowing Lily to reach her hands through. The soft sky-blue curtain would tightly wrap around the young girl's hands, thus preventing air circulation between the two sides. As long as she washed her hands with alcohol afterwards, the possibility of infection should be eliminated.

The order at the dock was maintained by more than fifty soldiers of the First Army on the ship. The discipline maintained in the face of the terrifying contagious epidemic was not because their will was particularly strong, but because the majority of the soldiers believed that Miss Nana, like an angel, would surely heal them completely.



After the box room was ready, a soldier who could still walk on his own and had black spots only on his arms was selected.



He walked into the room as instructed, stood still, and Lily reached her hand through the partition to use her power. Roland stood by her side, observing the soldier's condition through the window.



The influence of magic was silent. The young girl nodded her head to indicate completion, and he asked, "How do you feel now?"



"Your Highness, Prince Roland?" The soldier recognized Roland's voice, excitedly stood at attention and saluted, then froze in place. "Eh, I feel my strength returning. My God, Your Highness, I feel so much better!"



Roland could see it too— the black spots on his hand were receding rapidly, which was definitely not a symptom of the bubonic plague. If he remembered correctly, the latter's black spots were due to concurrent septicemia and severe cyanosis, and even after the plague bacillus was killed, these spots would take a long time to fade, whereas Lily had no ability to rejuvenate the flesh.



However, her new ability did indeed have a therapeutic effect on the unknown disease, which slightly relieved Roland.



"It's good that you've recovered. Go and call the other soldiers over, ten at a time. Regardless of whether they show symptoms or not, they all need to come in for treatment."



"Yes! Your Highness," the soldier paused for a moment, then saluted again and said, "Thank you, Miss Nana."



"It's not Nana, Miss Lily is the one who saved your life this time," Roland corrected with a smile. "If it's serious to the point where the skin has burst open and is bleeding, then you will need Miss Nana to treat you."



"Is... is that so," he touched his head, "then thank you, Miss Lily."

Once the soldier had left, Lily glanced at the prince, "It's fine to credit Nana, I don't need any thanks."

Oh, is that so? Then why were you standing so straight just now? Roland looked at her swaying twin ponytails, couldn't resist reaching out to tousle her hair, and she unexpectedly did not protest, just grunted softly.

If it's not the plague, what exactly is causing the illness? He stepped out of the cabin, and Nightingale immediately came over, "Your Highness, I just saw a strange phenomenon. The blood flowing from those people... there are signs of magical power in it."

"What?" Roland was stunned.

"It's like specks of starlight in the night sky within the mist," Nightingale asserted, "I have never seen such faint glows of magic power."

This was an unexpected discovery. Anything related to magic power was either due to witches or connected to the Church. At least now it was certain that this epidemic was not caused by natural bacteria or viruses.

"I see," the prince pondered for a moment, "In that case, let's draw some blood for observation."

"No, you might get infected!" she said anxiously, trying to stop him.



"Rest assured," Roland smiled at her, "Lily's new abilities have completely suppressed the disease."

The blood sample was taken from a comatose civilian, and he placed a glass slide smeared with black blood onto the stage, adjusting the focus. As the image in the lens gradually became clear—if the thing causing the symptoms was about the size of bacteria, it was likely that nothing would be seen. But the moment the focus overlapped with the target, Roland could hardly believe his eyes.

Within the narrow field of vision, several creatures with tentacles and bloated bellies were slowly swimming in the liquid, occasionally ejecting a stream of mucus, like fine strands of hair. They were about the size of single-celled algae, yet, similar to the carriers created by Lily, their bodies were not transparent, making it hard to tell if they belonged to single-celled organisms.

Fortunately, the magical glow on the creatures' bodies did not affect the little girl's abilities. When the blood mixed with the replicants was dropped into the sample, the replicants would even prioritize attacking these strange creatures, turning them into their own kind.

After all the first army soldiers had recovered, to avoid any accidents, Roland ordered all refugees entering the bunkhouse to wear headcovers, escorted by the soldiers. Another bunkhouse was also set up, primarily for Nana to treat those with serious injuries and open wounds.

The treatment continued from noon until evening, and when more than five hundred people from ten boats had all recovered, a thunderous cheer erupted from the crowd. Many people fell to their knees, shouting long live His Highness, and the waves of cheers persisted for a long time.

"You don't seem very happy?" Nightingale winked at him.

"The ones who cured the plague are not me, but Lily and Nana, the witches," Roland shook his head, "They should be the ones receiving the cheers."

That being said, it wasn't wise to reveal the truth to the public before they had fully accepted witches. He sighed softly, hoping that one day the witches could also stand in the limelight.



Nightingale seemed to understand what was on Roland's mind, and she patted his shoulder generously, "No one will mind, you've already done well enough. Besides, this day was bound to come sooner or later, wasn't it?" She paused for a moment, "Oh, and there's some good news I forgot to tell you."



"What is it?"



"The Witch Union might be getting a new member soon," Nightingale said with a grin.
