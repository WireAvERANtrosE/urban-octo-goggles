## "Bad News"
Peter never thought that he would revisit the old place so soon.

He originally did not want to leave the warmth of his home during such a cold winter, especially when demonic beasts were rampant, but Duke Lion specifically instructed him to deliver this hot potato of a document directly to the Fourth Prince’s hands.

He was, of course, aware of the content of the document—in fact, the entire upper echelon of Greycastle was discussing this shocking news: The King of Greycastle had fallen due to an assassination, and the murderer was none other than Herman Wimbledon, the King's eldest son. Subsequently, the second son rushed to the royal capital, declaring that a country cannot be without a monarch for a day, and that he would ascend to the throne as the second in line.

However, this action was not accepted by everyone. There were claims that Herman's trial was very suspicious; throughout the entire interrogation, he only made a few appearances, and he was unable to speak, with his hands tightly bound. There were hopes to wait until the matter was thoroughly investigated before deciding upon the succession to the throne.

Others rumored that this was nothing but a play written and directed by the second son, Timothy Wimbledon, with the real murderer being the Second Prince, who put on a sorrowful facade yet could hardly wait to ascend to the throne.

Regardless of who was right or wrong in this debate, the Second Prince, with the strong support of the Prime Minister, still temporarily seized the highest ruling power of Greycastle, acting as the king. At the same time, he issued a recall order to all his competitors—the struggle for the throne was over, and upon receiving the decree, all princes and princesses should return to the royal capital by the end of winter. The new king would officially confer fiefs and titles based on the governance of these six months.

Peter could clearly sense the urgency in this order.

Whether Timothy Wimbledon could secure the throne depended entirely on the reactions of the other princes and princesses. If they all obediently gave up the struggle for the throne and returned to the royal city, then he would naturally become the undisputed Wimbledon IV.

The document sent to Border Town would first be transferred to Longsong Stronghold, and Duke Lion himself sneered at this recall order. The king, while alive, still had greater control over the lords of various lands, but as for the Second Prince, his forceful ascension to the throne was done in a very crude manner. Moreover, with the precedent of Herman being sent to the guillotine, it was feared that no one would be willing to return to the royal capital alone.



However, in the eyes of the six families of the stronghold, this was a timely command.



Two months ago, the Count of Elk's unilateral actions had greatly displeased the Duke, especially since it had failed. The Prince's reaction was also very intense, sentencing Hils Mead to hanging. With this, both sides could be said to have openly torn their faces apart.



The Duke had originally planned to wait until the Evil Months were over before freeing up his hands to deal with this trouble. Now with this official document, he could act even more justifiably. If Roland Wimbledon returned to the royal capital, Border Town would naturally belong to Duke Lion. If he didn't return, then the Duke could press him with military force—under the banner of the new king.



As for who would ultimately receive the crown, the Duke wasn't too concerned.



But for Peter, the ambassador, things were clearly not going so smoothly. Last time, he had pledged to bring a new trade treaty, but what arrived instead was the black hand of the Elk family. Now he had come, bringing with him bad news—whether it was the death of King Wimbledon III or the recall order of the new king, Peter believed that the Fourth Prince wouldn't want to see either.



The journey was smooth sailing. Greycastle was a country on the southern edge of the continent, and even in winter, the rivers wouldn't freeze.



Peter occasionally looked out the window toward the riverbanks. Along the way, he saw neither corpses of those who had died of hunger nor refugees, indicating that Border Town had not yet fallen.



This surprised him a little. After all, during his last visit to the city walls, he had seen firsthand how they were constructed. For these walls made of mud and stones, Peter truly didn't hold much confidence.



Then something even more surprising happened. A sailboat flying the flag of Willow Town slowly passed by on the right side of the river channel—this scene seemed familiar, but now it was the Evil Months! They were still doing business while fighting against the demonic beasts? Without relocating all the mining workers to the defensive line, how could they possibly withstand those vicious creatures?



Three days later, the ship arrived at the dock of Border Town.

It was still the same shabby wooden dock, but now there was a simple wooden shed added beside it. After the ship moored, two guards came out of the shed, watching every move of the boatmen.

Peter immediately understood the purpose of Roland setting a guard post here.

It was clear that the Fourth Prince did not want anyone to secretly leave the town via the water route.

He jumped off the gunwale, and after explaining his identity to the guards, one of them brought a horse over and accompanied him to the castle.

Just like the last time, Prince Roland Wimbledon received him in the parlor. Not only that, although it was not mealtime, the prince still ordered his servants to prepare a sumptuous meal.

Roast pork leg, dried fish slices, a bowl of salad with unnameable wild vegetables, as well as butter bread and vegetable soup that could be seen at any banquet.

It seemed that the prince liked to dine first before discussing official matters.

Peter thought as such, but his hands did not stop for a moment, as opportunities to have a full meal were rare. Even for the Honeysuckle family, when not hosting guests, their meals were basically potato bread with dried salted meat.



After finishing the main course, as the dessert was served, Peter respectfully handed over the document.



Roland took it, used his dinner knife to break the seal wax, pulled out the scroll to quickly glance over it, and then he was stunned.



The King was dead?



For this nominal father, Roland had no feelings. He had already been in Border Town when he crossed over and had never even seen him, let alone the fact that the fourth prince's memories only contained grievances and dissatisfaction towards his father. It was precisely because of this that he felt caught in a strange awkwardness—should he show sorrow and distress?



The content that followed smelled even more of a conspiracy. King Wimbledon III died through the murder by his eldest son? The second prince, declaring himself as the new King, announced the end of the fight for the throne, ordering him to return to the capital of Greycastle immediately?



Roland coughed twice, raised his head, and met Peter's apologetic eyes.



So that's how it is, he thought, Duke Stronghold would probably be happy to see this happen. Whether he obeyed the new King's orders or not, it would be a dilemma for him.



He did not bring the agreed-upon contract but instead brought bad news akin to a death knell; he probably felt guilty about it too. Roland chuckled to himself, refolded the document, "I understand."



"Uh, Your Highness, so what do you plan to..."



"Even if I wanted to leave, I would have to wait until the Evil Months are over. With the world covered in ice and snow, what would happen to the people of Border Town if I left?"



If it were anyone else, Peter would have certainly replied with a perfunctory phrase like "Don't worry, the stronghold will handle it properly," or some other formulaic diplomatic response. But in front of this Fourth Prince, whom he had met only twice, he found himself unable to speak so casually. For the first time, Peter felt disgusted with his own role as an ambassador. In the end, he simply nodded, "I understand. Do you need me to convey a reply?"



Roland called for a servant to bring pen and paper, and quickly wrote a reply, sealing it with his own stamp, and handed it to Peter. The latter glanced at the envelope, which clearly addressed the Second Prince of Greycastle, Timothy Wimbledon, rather than King Wimbledon IV.



He has made his stance clear, Peter thought.
