## "What you hoped for"
When Nightingale finished speaking, the room fell silent once more, the only sound was the occasional crackling of the burning candle.

Roland's expression was serious, he finally had a general understanding of the witch community.

The awakening of most witches occurred during the Demonic Months, which were said to be the days when the gates of hell opened. Generally speaking, adulthood was a dividing line for witches; women who had not awakened by the age of eighteen were unlikely to become witches, while those who awakened before eighteen would suffer the pain of demonic devouring on the day of their awakening every year.

This pain was unimaginable to ordinary people. Nightingale's voice trembled when she spoke of this part, according to her own experience, it was as if something wanted to burst out of her body, every blood vessel and tendon was painfully swollen, and in the end, blood would seep from the skin, and the eyeballs would bulge out of the eye sockets...

If one could endure it, the body would slowly recover after resting for four or five days, but those who couldn't persevere would die from this torture, and their death was too horrible to look upon.

Nightingale had witnessed the death of several companions; their bodies lost the ability to support themselves and turned into bloated lumps of flesh. Blood mixed with viscera would spray out from the holes in the body and turn into black mist when it met the air. Eventually, when everything that could be expelled had been, only a layer of charred skin was left on the ground.

This was why witches were seen as incarnations of the devil.

Ordinary people who witnessed this scene would be scared out of their wits, who would care about the true cause of death? With the church fanning the flames, claiming that this was the outcome of believing in the devil, witches became the spokespersons of evil over time.

No matter how outsiders viewed it, this torment was real, and it was for this reason that witches generally had short lifespans. The pain became more unbearable as time went on, and many chose to end their own lives.

The demonic devouring that came with turning eighteen was known as the most difficult hurdle to cross. In fact, the magic power obtained by witches before this was not complete; it was only after reaching adulthood that this power would stabilize. Once stabilized, the magical power would increase significantly compared to before, and might even develop new branching abilities.

Unfortunately, the process of stabilization was extremely painful, the strength of the magic power devouring the body exceeded the limits of what most people could endure, and many witches died on the day of their adulthood.

After listening, Roland was silent for a long time before asking in a low voice, "The ancient books record that witches can find eternal peace on the Holy Mountain, without suffering from demonic devouring. Is that true?"

"No one knows, because the Holy Mountain has only appeared in legends. However, taking them to the Witch Cooperation Association camp would increase their chances of survival. If witches don't have to hide themselves and can live freely, the strength of the devouring power will be much weaker than before."

Roland was in turmoil; he needed the help of Anna and Nana for his plans, but the thought of making them take such great risks due to his plans was unbearable. Eventually, he said weakly, "Anna is downstairs, I'll call her over. If she is willing, then you can take her away. As for Nana, I'll have to wait until tomorrow to see her."

"Thank you for your understanding, I knew I wasn't wrong about you," Nightingale said as she stood up to show her respect.

At this time, Anna had not yet gone to sleep, and when Roland went to call her, she was hunched over the table, copying something. She looked somewhat surprised to see Roland. When she heard that she was to go to the prince's room, Anna didn't ask any questions and obediently followed him upstairs.

Upon entering the room and discovering there was another person inside, the girl was genuinely startled. Roland took her hand and briefly introduced them, and the three of them sat down around a round table. Nightingale repeated what she had said before, "...In the camp, there are many others just like you, they are all your companions."

"That's roughly the situation, Miss Anna. Although I have signed an employment contract with you, I must respect your opinion in situations that may endanger your life. If you agree—"

"I'm not leaving."

Roland was taken aback, "You said what—"

"I said I'm not leaving," Anna quickly interrupted Roland's words, "I want to stay here."

"Anna, I didn't lie to you," Nightingale frowned, "I can feel the magic surging inside you; it's nearly mature. Two months from now, the Demonic Moon will mark your coming of age, the sooner you get to the camp, the safer you'll be."

She ignored Nightingale and turned her head to look at Roland.

"Your Highness, do you remember when you once asked me if I wanted to return to Teacher Karl's academy like Nana, to study with the other children?"

Roland nodded.

"I didn't answer at the time. And all those things you said afterward... about living a normal life and such, I don't care," Anna's voice was calm and natural, "I just want to stay by Your Highness's side, that's all."

Roland had thought he understood Anna's psyche, but now he realized he didn't understand at all.

In her eyes, he couldn't read any emotion. Not dependency, nor adoration, he couldn't see anything... only a profound tranquility.

He remembered the first time they met, she had the same candid gaze.

The difference was, now her face was full of vitality, like a bud waiting to bloom. She still didn't fear death, but she no longer awaited it.

"The demonic plague won't kill me," Anna said word by word, "I will defeat it."

Nightingale closed her eyes and took a deep breath, "...Alright, I understand."

"So, you will leave alone?" Roland asked.

"No, I might as well stay here too," she pulled up her hood and stood up, "After all, the camp won't be moving until the Month of Demons ends."

"Why?" Roland was surprised. Was she planning to monitor him all winter?

"I think, a fledgling who has never experienced adulthood will not understand its dangers. I have struggled on the brink of death several times and witnessed the demise of my companions. When that day comes, at least I can be of help to her. If..." Nightingale shrugged, "If she doesn't make it, I have the experience to deal with the aftermath."

She walked to the door, pulled out her dagger, and once again knelt before Roland, "Then, I bid you farewell." After speaking, her figure gradually disappeared into the darkness, like mist, leaving no trace behind.

Is this Nightingale's ability? Roland pondered, a silent technique of concealment, a natural-born assassin. And judging by her dagger throwing skill, she must have received related training. Besides taking in their own kind, was the Witch Cooperation Association also developing its own power? Or had she mastered these skills before being recruited into the association?

Information about this organization was scant, and Roland could not find any useful details in his memory, but he had a feeling that he would encounter this organization again, as long as he continued on the path of witch farming.

"It's getting late, you should go back to sleep," Roland patted the girl's head.

To his surprise, Anna brushed his hand away and walked out of the room without a word.

Closing the door, the light was blocked behind her, and shadows enveloped her. She leaned gently against the door, her eyes previously calm as a lake, no longer tranquil.

She raised her head, her arms in front of her face, and whispered in a barely audible voice.

"...Idiot."
