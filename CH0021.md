## What you hoped for
When Nightingale finished speaking, the room fell silent again, with only the occasional crackling sound of the burning candles.



Roland's expression was grave; he had finally gained a general understanding of the witches.



Most witches' awakenings occurred during the Evil Months, the days which legend said were when the gates of hell opened. Generally speaking, adulthood was a dividing line for witches. Women who hadn't awakened by the age of eighteen were unlikely to become witches, while those who awakened before eighteen would suffer the agony of being devoured by demons on the anniversary of their awakening each year.



This pain was unimaginable for ordinary people. When Nightingale spoke of this, her voice trembled. According to her own experience, it felt as though something wanted to burst out of her body, with every blood vessel and tendon swelling and throbbing unbearably. Eventually, blood would seep from the skin, and the eyes would bulge out of their sockets...



If one could endure it, the body would slowly recover after resting for four or five days. However, those who couldn't bear it would die from this torment, and their deaths were too gruesome to behold.



Nightingale had witnessed the passing of several companions. Their bodies lost the ability to support themselves and turned into bloated masses of flesh. Blood mixed with viscera would spurt from the body's orifices, turning into plumes of black fog upon contact with the air. In the end, when everything that could be expelled had been, only a charred layer of skin would remain on the ground.



This was the evidence that led to witches being seen as incarnations of devils.



Ordinary people who witnessed this scene would be scared out of their wits; who would then care about the real cause of death? With the church fanning the flames, claiming that this was the outcome of putting one's faith in devils, witches gradually became the spokesperson for evil over time.



Regardless of how outsiders viewed it, this torment was very real, and it was also the reason why witches generally had short lifespans. As time went on, it became harder to endure, and many chose to end their own lives.



The demonic bite that comes with turning eighteen is considered the most difficult hurdle to overcome. In fact, the magic power obtained by witches before they reach adulthood is not complete; it only stabilizes after they become adults. The stabilized magic power will see a significant increase compared to before, and may even develop new branching abilities.



Unfortunately, the stabilization process is extremely painful, with the intensity of the demonic bite exceeding the limits of what ordinary people can endure. Many witches die on the day they come of age.



After listening, Roland fell silent for a long time before asking in a low voice, "The ancient books record that witches can find eternal peace on the Holy Mountain, free from the torment of the demonic bite. Is this true?"



"No one knows, for the Holy Mountain has only appeared in legends. However, taking them to the Witch Cooperation Association camp would increase their chances of survival. If witches didn't have to hide themselves and could live freely, the power of the bite would be much less than before."



Roland was in turmoil. He needed the help of Anna and Nana for his plans, but he couldn't bear to put them at such great risk because of his own schemes. Eventually, he said listlessly, "Anna is downstairs. I'll go call her over. If she's willing, you can take her away. As for Nana, I won't be able to see her until tomorrow."



"Thank you for your understanding. I knew I wasn't wrong about you," Nightingale said as she got up to bow.



Anna hadn't gone to sleep yet; when Roland went to call her, she was bent over the table, copying something. She looked somewhat surprised to see Roland. When she heard that she was to go to the prince's room, Anna didn't ask any questions and obediently followed him upstairs.



The girl was quite startled to find someone else in the room. Roland took her hand and briefly introduced her, and the three of them sat down around a round table. Nightingale repeated what she had said before, "...At the camp, there are many people like you, and they are all your companions."



"That's the situation, Miss Anna. Although I have entered into an employment contract with you, I must respect your wishes in the face of potential life-threatening danger. If you agree—"



"I am not leaving."

Roland was startled. "What did you say—"

"I said I am not leaving," Anna quickly interrupted Roland's words, "I want to stay here."

"Anna, I'm not lying to you," Nightingale frowned, "I can feel the magic surging in your body; it's nearly mature. The Evil Months in two months' time is your coming of age, and the sooner you get to the camp, the safer you'll be."

She ignored the other person and turned her head to look at Roland.

"Your Highness, do you still remember when you asked me if I wanted to go back to Teacher Karl's academy, to study with the other children like Nana?"

Roland nodded.

"I didn't answer at the time, and I don't care about what you said afterward... about living like a normal person," Anna's voice was calm and natural, "I just want to stay by Your Highness's side, that's all."

Roland thought he had understood Anna's psychology, but now he realized he didn't understand her at all.



In the other person's eyes, he could not read any emotions. Not reliance, nor admiration, nothing could be seen... only an unfathomable tranquility.



He remembered the scene when they first met, with eyes just as calm.



The difference was, at this moment, her face was filled with vitality, like a bud waiting to bloom. She still did not fear death, but she no longer expected it.



"The demonic bite cannot kill me," Anna said word by word, "I will overcome it."



Nightingale closed her eyes, took a deep breath, and said, "...Alright, I understand."



"Then, will you leave on your own?" Roland asked.



"No, I might as well stay here," she pulled up her hood and stood up, "Anyway, the camp won't move until the end of the Evil Months."



"Why?" Roland was taken aback. Was she planning to watch over him all winter?



"I think, a fledgling who has not experienced adulthood will not understand its dangers. I've struggled on the brink of death several times and have witnessed the demise of companions. When that day comes, at the very least I can help her. If..." Nightingale shrugged, "If she doesn't make it through, I also have the experience of handling what comes after."



She walked to the door, pulled out her dagger, and once again knelt to Roland, "Then, I take my leave." After speaking, her figure gradually disappeared into the darkness, leaving no trace behind, as if she were mist.



Is this Nightingale's ability? Roland thought to himself, a soundless stealth technique, a natural-born assassin. And judging by the way she threw that dagger, she definitely had received related training. Was the Witch Cooperation Association collecting their own kind while also developing their own power? Or had she mastered these skills before being recruited into the Association?



There was too little information about this organization, and Roland could not find anything useful in his memory. However, he had a feeling that he would encounter this organization again, as long as he continued down the path of witch farming.



"It's getting late, you should go back to sleep," Roland said, patting the girl's head.



To his surprise, Anna pushed his hand aside and walked out of the room without saying a word.



When the door closed, the light was cut off behind her, and shadows enveloped her. She leaned gently against the door, her eyes, previously calm like a lake's surface, no longer serene.



She lifted her head, raised her arm to shield her face, and finally, in a barely audible voice, she murmured.



"...Idiot."
