## Soap and Alcohol
The setting sun slanted to the west, and the rolling heat began to subside, while the summer cicadas that had chirped all day gradually quieted down. However, compared to the surrounding Sea of the Sleeping Island, the castle still seemed a bit stuffy.



Sweating all over, Evelyn climbed to the second floor, pushed open the bedroom door, and a wave of coolness immediately enveloped her.



"You worked hard on the test today," a woman with tied-up black hair, mature and capable in appearance, smiled and said, "How was it? Did everything go smoothly?"



She was Scroll, the oldest witch in the Witch Union, and also a very kind senior. After only a short day of interaction, she had already felt the other's care and concern.



"I... I don't know," Evelyn replied somewhat dejectedly, "The others all displayed their abilities, but when it came to my turn, His Highness only asked me a few questions before letting me step down. Does he think... that I am not useful?"



Scroll handed over a cup of iced water, "There is no such thing as a useless ability, only abilities that have not yet been developed. This is what Roland His Highness often says to us, so you don't have to worry about that."



"But..." she took the cup, hesitating to continue.



"Worried about being neglected because you can't be of use?" Scroll couldn't help but laugh, "That might have been possible in the previous Witch Union, but in Border Town, His Highness has never treated any witch differently, and Hummingbird can testify to that."



The girl who was busy looking for clothes in the cupboard raised her head, "That's generally correct. Like me, Miya, Lily, and Miss Nana lately haven't had much to do, and His Highness still encourages us to play the game of Gwent to pass the time."



"Relieve boredom?" Evelyn's eyes widened.

"Mm-hmm, unbelievable, right? Work hard when there's work to do, play joyfully when there's not. That's what he said," Hummingbird paused, "Though I think His Highness still has a slight bias, he's obviously nicer to Anna."

"That's because she was the first witch he met, naturally he has deeper feelings for her," Scroll tapped her on the head, "Hurry up and finish with your clothes, or there won't be much running water left." Then she looked at Evelyn, "You come with us too."

"Where to?" the latter asked, puzzled.

"To take a shower," Scroll smiled, "In the Summer, there's nothing more comfortable than standing under a showerhead and bathing."

When Evelyn followed them into the bathroom, she couldn't help but exclaim in surprise. It was as if she had entered a vast prairie, with clouds and mountains ahead, and the setting sun's afterglow shining through the window, casting a golden hue on the clouds on the wall.

"This is—"

"Soraya's masterpiece," Scroll said with a smile, "This is not your traditional mural, you'll know once you take off your shoes."

Evelyn carefully placed her wooden sandals in the shoe cabinet at the entrance and stepped barefoot onto the "prairie." She immediately understood what the other meant. The delicate sensation under her feet was just like dense grass, and the tips of the grass even contained full droplets of water, as if it had just rained heavily.



Scroll, having removed her clothes and let down her hair from the ponytail, now had her long black hair cascading down. She walked to the wall, twisted a handle, and from the showerhead that extended above her head, dozens of streams of water suddenly sprayed out, enveloping her in their embrace.



"How is it, pretty convenient, right?" Hummingbird handed her a round object, "This is a bathing product invented by His Highness. It feels absolutely amazing when used with the shower. Here, let me show you how to use it."



...



When Evelyn returned to her room, her whole body felt lighter.



She had never experienced such a comfortable bath before. When she rubbed soap on her body to create lather and then rinsed it off with water, the stickiness on her body was swept away, replaced by a sense of refreshment and smoothness. After putting on clean clothes, the hot air seemed to cool down. Raising her arms, she could still smell the lingering scent of roses on her skin.



Is this the daily life of a Witch Cooperation Association witch?



Evelyn still found it somewhat unbelievable. She was born in the outer city district of the royal capital and her family ran a tavern. Although most of the customers were farmers, the topics of conversation always revolved around the nobles of the inner city and their extravagant lives, which she heard a lot about while serving drinks. For example, there were stories about bathtubs inlaid with gold and filled with wine, and milk baths scattered with rose petals... But even among these astonishing tales, none could compare to her personal experience today—at least Evelyn didn't think that bathing in wine and milk could be that comfortable.



Considering that the castle's owner was a real prince, it made sense for him to value comfort and pleasure. But for the witches to live a life similar to that of the royal nobility was beyond her imagination. Before going to Sleeping Island, even maintaining a normal and peaceful life was a luxury.



"Are you hungry?" Scroll, having dried her hair and retied it into a braid, asked, "It's almost time for dinner, let's go to the hall."



In the reception room on the first floor, the long wooden table was already filled with various dishes. Evelyn roughly counted and there were six pots of meat alone, as well as egg custard, vegetable soup, and roasted mushrooms, not at all inferior to last night's welcome feast.



When all the other witches were seated, everyone began to eat. She noticed that some people, in addition to knives and forks, were also using a pair of wooden sticks to pick up food, and His Highness did the same. He hardly ever picked up a knife and fork, his wooden sticks flipping up and down in his hands, looking very agile. The food in the bowls was also different from the large chunks of meat or whole chickens and ducks commonly seen in taverns—the steak was cut into small pieces, the wild boar leg had the bones removed, ready to be eaten directly.



As the dinner was drawing to a close, Prince Roland suddenly clapped his hands, "I have come up with two new things recently, and plan to promote them as products. However, I am not sure about how effective they are, so I want you to try them first and give me your opinions."



"Is it something to eat?"



"Sure, I want to try!"



"Me too, coo!"



The witches from the Union broke into cheers, while Evelyn looked at Scroll with a puzzled face. She smiled and explained, "His Highness often invents some novel things, like the soap you used before, as well as perfume, chopsticks, ice cream... He has us try them out before officially putting them into production."



"Ahem," Prince Roland cleared his throat, "The first item is distilled spirits. Compared to the common beer and fruit wine, its flavor is richer and it's easier to become intoxicated by, so underage witches are not allowed to partake."



"Your Highness, that's prejudice!" Lightning protested, "I can drink more than those adult sailors!"



"That won't do either."

"Um..." The little girl pouted, but Roland remained unmoved. He ordered the attendant to bring the distilled spirits that had been prepared, distributing them to the adult witches.

Three glasses were placed in front of Evelyn—each crystal clear glass contained different drinks: one was colorless and transparent, just like water; another was milky white; and the last one was a bright, sparkling orange-yellow. Under the flickering candlelight, one could even see some tiny particles floating within, resembling an unfiltered fruit wine.

"They are distilled spirits mixed with apple juice, distilled spirits mixed with milk, and pure distilled spirits," Roland introduced. "Ice can be added to taste, the more you add, the lighter the flavor of the drink." Then he smiled at Evelyn and said, "You have worked in a tavern in the King's City, and your ability is to brew different kinds of drinks. I'd like to hear your opinion on this new type of liquor."

Evelyn's heart couldn't help but thump twice. She picked up the glass with the orange liquor and took a sip. Indeed, as His Highness had said, the flavor of the distilled spirits was much stronger than that of beer, even somewhat throat-burning, and her taste buds detected a hint of bitterness. However, the fresh fragrance of the apple diluted its impact, leaving the rich aroma of the liquor to linger last—she had never tasted such an outstanding drink before.

The distilled spirits mixed with milk was smoother, with the bitterness almost gone. She could tell that, besides milk, there must have been some honey or sugar added, the sweetness blending with the aroma of the liquor to form a completely new flavor.

When it came to the last glass, Evelyn was full of anticipation. She took a small sip, and the burning sensation immediately rolled over her tongue and down her throat—as she had expected, without the interference of other flavors, only the pure taste of the liquor remained. First came the spiciness, then the sweetness underlying the bitterness.

"The taste of these three drinks is... unforgettable," she put down the glass and took a breath, "Your Highness, some may not be able to accept its strong stimulating taste, but I think those who truly enjoy drinking would not refuse to have such a full-bodied aroma."

"Is that so?" Roland smiled, "That's good to hear, but this one is not the strongest distilled spirit. I can further enhance its richness, and then let you try it again."



"Uh, did he choose me just to test his new wine?" Despite feeling somewhat puzzled, Evelyn still replied, "Yes, Your Highness."

After the wine glasses and plates had been cleared away, the prince commanded his attendant to bring over a stack of boxes, placing them on the long table.

"This is the second new thing, and also a small gift I intend to give to you all," he paused, "a special piece of clothing."
