## Soap and Alcohol
The setting sun slanted westward, and the rolling heat waves began to subside, while the summer cicadas that had chirped all day gradually quieted down. However, compared to the Sleepy Island surrounded by seas on all sides, the castle still felt somewhat stuffy.



Covered in sweat, Evelyn climbed to the second floor, pushed open the bedroom door, and was immediately enveloped by a wave of cool air.



"Today's test was hard work," a woman with black hair tied up, looking mature and capable, said with a smile. "How did it go, was it smooth?"



Her name was Scroll, the oldest witch in the Witch Cooperation Association, and also a very kind senior. In just one short day of being together, she had already felt the care and concern from the other party.



"I... don't know," Evelyn replied, somewhat disheartened, "Everyone else displayed their abilities, but when it was my turn, His Highness only asked a few questions before letting me go. Does it mean... he thinks I'm not very useful?"



Scroll handed over a cup of iced water, "There are no abilities without any use, only abilities that have yet to be developed. This is what Roland always says to us, so you don't have to worry about that."



"But..." She took the cup, hesitating to continue.



"Worried about being neglected because you won't be of use?" Scroll couldn't help but laugh, "If it was the previous Witch Cooperation Association, that might be possible. But in Border Town, His Highness has never treated any witch differently, Hummingbird can testify to that."



The girl who was rummaging through the cabinet for clothes raised her head, "That's roughly correct, like me, Miya, Lightning, and even Miss Nana recently don't have much to do, and His Highness even encourages us to play the card game Gwent to pass the time."



"Bored?" Evelyn's eyes widened in surprise.



"Uh-huh, unbelievable, right? Work hard when there's work, play happily when there's not. That's what he said," Hummingbird paused, "But I think His Highness still has a bit of favoritism, he's obviously much nicer to Anna."



"That's because she was the first witch he met, naturally his feelings for her are much deeper," Scroll tapped her head, "Hurry up and clean your clothes, if we're any later there won't be much running water left." Then she turned to Evelyn, "You should come with us too."



"Go where?" the latter asked, puzzled.



"Take a shower," Scroll said with a smile, "In the summer, there's nothing more comfortable than standing under a showerhead and taking a bath."



When Evelyn followed the two into the bathroom, she couldn't help but exclaim in amazement. It was as if she had walked into a vast prairie, with seas of clouds and mountains ahead, and the afterglow of the setting sun shining through the window, casting a golden hue on the clouds.



"This is—"



"Soraya's masterpiece," Scroll said with a smile, "This isn't just a traditional mural, you'll know once you take off your shoes."



Evelyn carefully placed her wooden sandals into the shoe cabinet by the door, and as she stepped barefoot onto the "prairie," she immediately understood what the other meant. The fine sensation under her feet was just like dense grass, and the tips even contained full droplets of water, as if a heavy rain had just fallen.



Scroll shed her clothes and let down her ponytail, her black hair cascading down. She walked to the wall, turned the handle, and from the showerhead above, dozens of streams of water suddenly sprayed out, enveloping her within.



"How about that, convenient, isn't it?" Hummingbird handed her a round object, "This is a bathing product invented by His Highness, it feels absolutely wonderful when used with the shower. Here, let me show you how to use it."

...

When Evelyn returned to her room, her whole body felt lighter.



She had never experienced such a comfortable bath before. When she lathered her body with soap, and the water washed the foam away in one fell swoop, the sticky feeling on her skin was instantly gone, replaced by a sensation of freshness and smoothness. After changing into clean clothes, even the hot air seemed to become cool, and as she lifted her arms, she could still smell the lingering scent of roses on her skin.



Is this the daily life of a witch from the Witch Union?



Evelyn found it hard to believe. She was born in the outer city district of the capital, where her family ran a tavern. Although the patrons were mostly farmers, conversations would inevitably turn to the nobility of the inner city district and their indulgent lifestyles. She had heard plenty while serving drinks. For example, bathtubs filled with wine and edged in gold, and milk baths scattered with rose petals... But even amidst those astonishing rumors, none seemed to match the experience she had today—at least Evelyn didn't think bathing in wine and milk would be that comfortable.



Considering that the castle's owner was a true prince, it was normal for him to value comfort and pleasure. But for witches to live a life akin to that of royal nobility was beyond her imagination. Before going to Sleeping Island, even maintaining a normal, peaceful life was a luxury.



"Are you hungry?" Scroll, having dried her hair and retied it into a braid, asked, "It's almost time for dinner, let's go to the hall."



In the parlor on the first floor, the long, square wooden table was already filled with a variety of dishes. Evelyn roughly counted, and there were six bowls of meat alone, not to mention the egg custard, vegetable soup, and roasted mushrooms, which were no less impressive than last night's welcome banquet.



As the other witches arrived, everyone began to eat. She noticed that some people, in addition to using knives and forks, were also using a pair of wooden sticks to pick up food, and His Highness did the same. He even rarely picked up a knife and fork, skillfully flipping the wooden sticks in his hands. The food in the serving dishes was also different from the large cuts of meat or whole chickens and ducks commonly seen in taverns—the steak was cut into small pieces, and the wild boar legs were deboned, ready to be eaten directly.



When dinner was drawing to a close, Prince Roland suddenly clapped his hands, "I've recently developed two new things that I plan to promote as products. However, I am not sure about their effects yet and would like you to try them first. Feel free to give me your opinions."



"What is it? Something to eat?"



"Great, I want to try!"



"Me too, coo!"



The witches from the Witch Union immediately burst into enthusiastic cheers, while Evelyn looked puzzledly towards Scroll, who explained with a smile, "His Highness often invents some new and interesting things, like the soap you used before, as well as perfume, chopsticks, ice cream... Before he officially starts production, he always lets us try them first."



"Cough cough," Prince Roland cleared his throat, "The first item is a distilled spirit, which compared to the common beer and fruit wine, has a richer flavor and is more intoxicating. Therefore, underage witches may not participate."



"Your Highness, that's prejudice!" Lightning protested, "I can drink more than some of those adult sailors!"



"That won't do either."

"Uh..." The little girl pouted, but Roland remained unmoved. He instructed the servant to bring up the distilled liquor that had been prepared and distribute it to the adult witches.

Three glasses were placed in front of Evelyn—each containing different mixtures in the sparkling crystal glasses: one was clear and colorless, like water; one was milky white; and the last one was a bright, shiny orange-yellow. Under the flickering candlelight, you could see some tiny particles floating in it, resembling an unfiltered fruit wine.

"They are distilled liquor mixed with apple juice, distilled liquor mixed with milk, and pure distilled liquor," Roland explained. "You can add ice cubes according to your taste. The more you add, the lighter the flavor becomes." Then he smiled at Evelyn, "You have worked in a tavern in the King's City, and your ability is to brew different kinds of liquor. I would like to hear your opinion on this new drink."

Evelyn's heart skipped a beat. She took a sip from the glass with the orange liquor. It was just as His Highness had described—the taste of the distilled liquor was much stronger than that of ale, even somewhat harsh on the throat, with a hint of bitterness on the tip of the tongue. However, the crisp fragrance of apple diluted its impact, leaving the rich aroma of the liquor itself to linger in the mouth—she had never tasted such an outstandingly good wine.

The distilled liquor mixed with milk was smoother. The bitterness had almost disappeared. She could taste that, besides milk, there was likely honey or sugar added, with the sweetness mingling with the aroma of the liquor to create a completely new flavor.

By the time it came to the last glass, Evelyn was full of anticipation. She took a small sip, and an instant burning sensation rolled over her tongue and throat—just as she had expected, without the interference of other flavors, there was only the pure taste of the liquor. It was fiery at first, followed by a sweetness underlying the bitterness.

"The flavors of these three drinks are all... unforgettable," she put down her glass and took a breath, "Your Highness, some people may not accept its strong stimulating taste, but I think those who truly love to drink would not resist such rich and mellow flavors."

"Is that so?" Roland smiled, "That's good to hear. However, this one is not the strongest distilled liquor. I can further enhance its richness. I'll have you taste it again when it's ready."



Uh, did he choose me just to test his new wine? Despite her confusion, Evelyn still responded, "Yes, Your Highness."



After the wine glasses and plates had been cleared away, the prince commanded his servants to bring over a stack of boxes and place them on the long table.



"This is the second new thing, and also a small gift I plan to give you," he paused, "a special piece of clothing."
