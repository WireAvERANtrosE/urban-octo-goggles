## Mutation
Even in the summer, the snow on the Hermes Plateau had not melted much.

Mayne stood at the top of the Tower of Heaven, gazing into the distance. Beyond the city walls, in the fields, there were only two colors—strips of green grass and pure white snow intertwined, like scars on the earth left by the battle of the Evil Months. Such a climate made it impossible to grow any crops, so all the food needed by the New Holy City had to be transported from the Old Holy City at the foot of the plateau, cart by cart, by animal power.

Having spent over a decade in Hermes, he had grown accustomed to the omnipresent cold.

"Is it just the two of us this time?" Tefren pushed the door open and entered. "Is it okay to not hold the meeting in the secret chamber?"

"Do you actually like being cooped up in that small room?"

"No... of course not," the old archbishop stroked his white beard, "If it weren't for Heather always reciting the disciplinary codes, I'd prefer exchanging information here every time. Even when she rants, at least I can enjoy the view of the Holy City. And..." He revealed a slight smile, "I didn't expect someone as punctual as her to be overdue this time?"

"Perhaps she has encountered some thorny issue," Mayne sat back down at the table, "or maybe she's already on her way."

"Perhaps..." Tefren curled his lip, "You really shouldn't be making excuses for her. Everyone should be as good as their word, as she is often fond of saying. Even if she ran into trouble, she should have reported to us first. It's not like she went to the eternal winter capital alone; sending a messenger would only take a moment."

"Let's not worry about her for now," Mayne pushed three letters across the table to Tefren, "We have trouble."



"Trouble?" The latter froze for a moment, then sat down across the round table and spread out the letter, "All bad news?"



"That's right," he took a deep breath, "It couldn't be worse."



Tefflon put away his smile and began to carefully read the first secret letter, "... The spread of the demonic plague has been halted, the Faceless is missing? Wait, what is the demonic plague?"



"It's the latest research achievement of the Secret Area. You don't need to know too much, just understand it as a type of contagion that spreads rapidly," Mayne explained simply. In fact, according to the words of Master Raven Eye, it's a type of micro demonic beast that, after special cultivation, has mutated specifically to target humans, and the Holy Spirit Medicine that can counter it is also a demonic beast, albeit much smaller in size. "The pathogen cannot be directly observed with the naked eye, and it cannot be cured by conventional means. The only ones who can stop the spread of the demonic plague are a certain kind of people."



"Witches?" Tefflon quickly came to the answer.



"And not just one," he said gravely.



After reading the letter, the old bishop slammed his fist on the table, "What is this fool doing? Sending rats to rout mercenaries is bad enough, but to also throw in the Faceless? Does he have any idea how important this Purifier is?"



"His idea is not necessarily wrong," Mayne frowned, "If the number of rats reported in the letter is not a lie, a thousand of them would be enough to take down the opposition's hundred or so mercenaries. However, it seems that the other side has a powerful type of continuous crossbow that can keep firing. I remember that the Priestess stationed in Longsong Stronghold also mentioned this; the reason Duke Ryan lost to a group of miners was because their crossbows were extremely powerful. It is true that wearing heavy armor and carrying firm shields can greatly reduce the damage from crossbow bolts, but the rats do not have such equipment."



"Even if he wants to use those scum, he shouldn't have sent out the Faceless so lightly!" Tefflon said angrily, "Now when Hester comes back, she is probably going to be furious. Witches who can grow into Purifiers are all extremely rare in their abilities, and it also takes a lot of effort to cultivate them. In a sense, they are more precious than the God's Punishment Army."



"But whether it is witches or the God's Punishment Army, the ultimate goal is to eliminate the enemy and achieve victory," Mayne said slowly. "Losses during usage are inevitable."



"Do you intend to spare the Fate Priest?"



"Do not forget the church's laws," Mayne's tone darkened, "judging by results alone is what nobles love to do. Although Farry met with failure, his intentions and plans did not have many problems; it was simply that the enemy was stronger. He will certainly be punished, but the specific measures need further consideration."



"However, Heather may not see it that way," Tefren shook his head, opening the second letter, "Don't forget, she is in charge of the church's arbitration."



"I will explain it to her."



Soon, the old archbishop had finished reading the letter in his hands, exclaiming in disbelief, "Timothy's militia sneaked an attack on the Longsong Stronghold's cathedral, then massacred the envoy group? Has he gone mad?!"



The content of the second letter actually came from two sources: one was a report from the stronghold's proxy, Petrov, and the other was intelligence from local believers. Putting it all together, it was indeed true that a militia force from beyond the Western Region had launched a surprise attack on the stronghold and plundered the cathedral. They had not only ingested berserk potions themselves; their target was also the drugs stored in the cathedral... So the first judgment could not be too far off. This force was either from the new King Timothy or from Queen of Clearwater, Grace. Comparing the two, the former seemed more likely.



As for the latter point, Mayne felt there was something odd. If it were as Petrov's report described, with the attackers burning down the cathedral and then immediately withdrawing from the stronghold without a trace, how did they manage to ambush the members of the envoy group? By that time, the delegation should have already reached Border Town, and the two parties should have had no chance of encountering each other.



Seeing Mayne silent, Tefren quickly realized this as well. He picked up the first letter and read it again, the wrinkles on his forehead deepening into furrows. "Could it be... Roland Wimbledon eliminated the envoy group and then pinned it all on his brother Timothy Wimbledon?"



"Let's speculate," the Archbishop said after a moment of silence, "Roland intends to acquire this batch of cheap labor, so he assigned witches to treat the demonic plague and transported all the refugees back to the Western Region. Before this, in order to avoid the envoy team noticing his harboring of witches, he sent knights to raid the envoy camp, preventing them from even releasing carrier pigeons, and then pushed the blame onto the fortress attackers. After all, Agent Petrov rose to his position with Roland's support, so it is natural for him to assist in the deception. Of course... this is all speculation, but the disappearance of the envoy team is indeed too suspicious, and we now lack the resources to send another envoy team."



"In that case, we should immediately dispatch troops to punish his presumptuous actions," said Tefiren with a cold voice, "Even if the envoy team has nothing to do with him, those witches heading to the Western Region are worth us sweeping clean."



Mayne did not respond but pointed to the third letter, "You should read the last letter before you say more."



Tefiren looked at him with confusion and opened the letter. His hands quickly began to tremble, and he nearly lost his grip on the thin piece of paper, "A large number of witches appeared in the Fjords and destroyed all the churches? Then this letter is..."



"From Seawindshire, the last church to be taken down," Mayne closed his eyes, leaning back in his chair, suddenly filled with weariness in his tone, "It's impossible for a large group of witches to appear in the Fjords out of nowhere. There's only one possibility; they migrated there from the mainland." The letter also mentioned Extraordinaries — according to the church's canon laws, once traces of Extraordinary witches are found, the God's Punishment Army must be deployed to capture them as a priority. But the Fjord Islands are far too distant, and with the tense situation in the Wolfheart battlefield, he simply cannot afford to attend to matters across the strait.



"Should we seek guidance from His Holiness the Pope?" asked Tefiren.



Mayne shook his head slightly, pressing down the surge of powerlessness in his heart. This might be the divine test for the church, for only through braving thorns and slashing through brambles can one see the truth of the divine. He opened his eyes, regaining his composure, "The Holy City of Hermes will be left to you and Hesse."



"Are you going to the Fjords?" the old bishop exclaimed.



"I will lead one hundred men from the God's Punishment Army and the Purifiers who remain in the church to thoroughly sweep through the Western Region of Greycastle, then find an opportunity to deal with the witches in the Fjords."



"But the law states—"

Main interrupted, "That's under the condition that the four great kingdoms have Extraordinaries. Now they are across the sea and can't affect our plans. Don't forget, our ultimate goal is to acquire more land and population, to continue expanding the God's Punishment Army. Obviously, the fourth prince of Greycastle poses a greater obstacle to us."

"But..." Taflin was about to retort when hurried footsteps sounded from outside the circular hall. Both men were slightly taken aback and turned their gaze towards the door in unison.

The door was pushed open with a bang, and a priest rushed in, flustered, "Disaster, my lord bishop, disaster!"

"Calm down!" Main commanded, "What's the matter? Speak slowly."

"Urgent intelligence from Lord Hester's entourage," the priest said with a very anxious expression, "A huge fleet has landed on the coast of the Kingdom of Everwinter, a large enemy force is besieging the capital, and the situation is precarious. The enemy ships all fly black sails, and their mast flags bear the green background with a galleon and crown."

"What?" Main could hardly believe his ears. Black sails, a galleon with a crown...

The enemy was Queen Clearwater's Black Sail Fleet!
