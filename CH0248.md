## Mutation
Even in the summer, the snow on the Hermes Plateau had melted very little.



Mayne stood at the top of the Tower of Heaven, gazing into the distance. Outside the city walls, the wilderness held only two colors—green grasslands and pure white snow interwoven together, like scars left on the earth after the battle of Evil Months. Such a climate made it impossible to grow any crops, so all the food needed by the New Holy City had to be transported from the foot of the plateau, that is, the Old Holy City, by animal-drawn carts.



Having stayed in Hermes for over a decade, he had grown accustomed to the omnipresent cold.



"Is it just the two of us this time?" Tefren entered by pushing the door, "Is it okay to hold the meeting outside the secret chamber?"



"Do you actually like being cooped up in that tiny room?"



"No... Of course not," the old bishop stroked his white beard, "If it weren't for Heather always reciting the code of discipline, I'd rather exchange information here every time. Even when she goes on her rants, I can at least enjoy the view of the Holy City. And..." He revealed a slight smile, "I didn't expect someone as punctual as her to be overdue this time?"



"Maybe she's run into some kind of trouble," Mayne sat back down at the table, "Maybe she's already on her way."



"Maybe..." Tefren curled his lip, "You really shouldn't make excuses for her. Everyone should keep their word, that's what she always says. Even if she encountered trouble, she should have reported to us first. She didn't go to the Eternal Winter Kingdom alone, sending a messenger would only take a moment."



"Let's not worry about her for now," Mayne pushed three letters across to Tefren, "We're the ones in trouble."



"Trouble?" The latter froze for a moment, sat down across the round table, and spread out the letter, "All bad news?"



"That's right," he took a deep breath, "as bad as it can be."



Tefflon's smile faded as he began to scrutinize the first secret letter, "...The spread of the demonic plague has been stopped, the Faceless Ones' whereabouts unknown? Wait, what is the demonic plague?"



"It's the latest research result from the Secret Area. You don't need to know too much, just understand it as a type of plague that can spread rapidly," Mayne explained briefly. In fact, according to Master Crow's words, it is a type of miniature demonic beast that, after special cultivation, has produced a mutation specifically targeting the human body, and the holy medicine that can counter it is also made from demonic beasts, but even smaller in form. "The pathogen cannot be directly observed with the eyes, and conventional methods are completely unable to cure it. There is only one kind of person who can stop the spread of the demonic plague."



"Witches?" Tefflon quickly thought of the answer.



"And not just one," he said gravely.



After reading the letter, the old bishop slammed his fist on the table, "What is this fool doing? Sending the rats to round up the mercenaries is one thing, but to throw in the Faceless Ones as well? Does he have any idea how important this Pure One is?"



"His idea is not necessarily wrong," Mayne frowned, "If there is no false report of numbers in the letter, a thousand rats are enough to take down the opposing hundred or so mercenaries. However, it seems that the other side has a powerful long-range crossbow that can fire continuously. On this point, I remember that Priest Thylo, stationed at the Longsong Stronghold, also mentioned it before—the reason Duke Lion was defeated by a group of miners was because the other side's crossbows were extremely powerful. Although wearing heavy armor and holding firm shields can greatly reduce the damage from crossbow bolts, the rats do not have such equipment."



"Even if he wants to use those scum, he shouldn't have easily dispatched the Faceless Ones!" Tefflon said angrily, "Now when Hester comes back, she's probably going to be furious. Witches who can grow into Pure Ones are all extremely rare abilities, and they also take a lot of effort to cultivate. In a sense, they are more precious than the God's Punishment Army."



"But whether it is witches or the God's Punishment Army, the ultimate goal is to eliminate the enemy and achieve victory," Mayne said slowly. "Losses during the process are inevitable."

"Do you mean to protect the Fate Priest?"

"Don't forget the church's laws," Mayne's tone sank, "Judging only by the results is what nobles love to do. Although Feryl met with a disastrous defeat, his starting point and plan didn't have many problems. It was just that the enemy was stronger. He will certainly be punished, but the specific measures need further consideration."

"However, Heather may not think so," Tavren shook his head, opening the second letter, "Don't forget, the church's arbitration is her responsibility."

"I will explain it to her."



After a while, the old bishop finished reading the letter in his hand, and said incredulously, "Timothy's militia ambushed the church in Longsong Stronghold and then slaughtered the entire envoy group? Has he lost his mind?!"

The content of the second letter actually came from two sources. One was a report from the Stronghold's agent, Peter, and the other was intelligence from local believers. Putting it all together, there indeed was a militia force from outside the Western Region that had ambushed the Stronghold and plundered the church. They not only consumed the Fury Pills themselves, but their target was also the drugs stored in the church… So the first judgment wouldn’t be too far off. This force was either from the new King Timothy or from Queen Grace of Clearwater. Between the two, the former was obviously more likely.



As for the latter point, Mayne always felt there was something odd. If, according to Peter's report, the enemy burned down the church and immediately withdrew from the Stronghold, disappearing without a trace, then how did they intercept the members of the envoy group? By that time, the envoy should have already arrived at Border Town, and the two parties should not have met at all.



Seeing Mayne silent, Tavren quickly realized this point as well. He picked up the first letter and read it again, the wrinkles on his forehead stacking into deep furrows, "Could it be... Roland Wimbledon eliminated the envoy group and then pinned it all on his brother Timothy Wimbledon?"



"Let's speculate," the Archbishop spoke after a moment of silence, "Roland intends to obtain this batch of cheap labor, so he assigned witches to treat the demonic plague and transported all the refugees back to the Western Region. Before this, to avoid the delegation noticing that he was harboring witches, he sent knights to raid the delegation's camp, preventing them from even releasing a carrier pigeon, and then blamed the attackers from the stronghold. After all, Agent Peter ascended to his position with Roland's support, so it's natural for him to assist in fabricating this story. Of course... this is all speculation, but the disappearance of the delegation is indeed too suspicious, and we currently lack the energy to dispatch another delegation."



"In that case, we should immediately dispatch troops to punish his arrogant actions," Tefren said coldly. "Even if the delegation's disappearance has nothing to do with him, those witches heading to the Western Region deserve to be eradicated."



Mayne did not respond but pointed to the third letter, "You should read the last letter before making any decisions."



Tefren looked at him with confusion and unfolded the letter. Soon, his hand began to tremble, and he almost couldn't hold onto the thin sheet of paper, "A large number of witches have appeared in the Fjords and destroyed all the churches? So this letter is..."



"From Sea Dragon Bay, it's also the last church to fall," Mayne closed his eyes, leaned back in his chair, and suddenly his tone was filled with fatigue, "It's impossible for a large group of witches to emerge in the Fjords out of nowhere. There's only one possibility: they have migrated from the mainland." The letter also mentioned the Transcendents—in the church's laws, it's clearly stipulated that if traces of Transcendent witches are found, the God's Punishment Army must be dispatched to capture them as a priority. But the Fjord Islands are simply too far away, and with the intense situation at the Wolfheart battlefield, he simply has no time to attend to matters across the strait.



"Should we consult His Holiness the Pope?" Tefren asked.



Mayne shook his head slightly, suppressing the feeling of powerlessness welling up inside him. This might be the trial that the Divine is putting the church through, and only by braving thorns can one see the truth of the Divine. He opened his eyes, regaining his composure, "I will leave the Holy City of Hermes to you and Hestia."



"Do you intend to head to the Fjords?" the old bishop exclaimed.



"I will lead one hundred of the God's Punishment Army and the Purifiers remaining in the church to thoroughly sweep the Western Region of Greycastle and then find an opportunity to deal with the witches of the Fjords."



"But the laws state—" 

Mayne cut him off, "That's under the circumstance that extraordinary individuals appear in the four major kingdoms. Now they are far across the sea and cannot impact our plans. Don't forget, our ultimate goal is to acquire more land and population and continue to expand the scale of the God's Punishment Army. It's obvious that the fourth prince of Graycastle poses a greater obstacle to us."



"But..." Just as Tavlin was about to argue, the sound of hurried footsteps came from outside the circular hall. Both men were slightly startled and turned to look at the door in unison.



The door was pushed open with a bang, and a priest rushed in, flustered, "It's bad, Lord Bishop, it's very bad!"



"Calm down!" Mayne shouted, "What happened, speak slowly."



"Urgent intelligence from Lady Heather's entourage," the priest said anxiously, "A huge fleet has landed on the coast of the Kingdom of Everwinter, a large group of enemies is besieging the capital, and the situation is precarious. The enemy ships all fly black sails, and the flag on the mast is a green base with a galleon and crown pattern." The priest looked extremely worried, "When the message was sent out, both city gates had already been lost, and Lady Heather is leading her followers in a desperate resistance, but the number of enemies is vast, and they are also using Fury Pills!"



"What?" Mayne couldn't believe his ears for a moment. Black sails, a galleon with a crown pattern...



The enemy turned out to be Queen Clearwater's Black Sail Fleet!
