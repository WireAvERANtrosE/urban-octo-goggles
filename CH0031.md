## "Our" friend
Roland sat in front of his desk in a daze, not expecting that someone would actually dare to attack the castle. If not for Nightingale's timely discovery, he might have already been poisoned.



Who was it this time? His three royal sisters or another sibling? Was there such a hurry? The struggle for the throne was set for five years, and only a few months had passed. Roland slapped the table in irritation. This was utterly unreasonable. Could he not have a peaceful winter?



Footsteps approached from outside the door, and the Chief Knight, Carter Lannis, entered. "Your Highness, we have identified the bodies. Seven of the eight dead were former members of the patrol team, and one's identity is unknown. Of the two who are still alive, one was treated by Miss Pine... no, the witch, and has yet to wake up. The other has been thrown into the dungeon and is under close watch."



The patrol team? Roland thought bitterly. He knew he couldn't trust the force raised by the former lord. Out of ten people, eight had betrayed them. Deciding not to let these men join the militia was indeed the right choice.



"Keep a close eye on the one locked up, and remind your men not to let him commit suicide by taking poison like last time!"



"Last time... like that?"



"Cough, it's nothing," Roland shook his head, realizing he was still muzzy from being woken up by Nightingale in the early hours, "In any case, I want to know everything from him—who instigated this, who made contact, who was bribed. Leave the investigation to you."



"Yes, Your Highness," Carter said and did not leave immediately, but instead knelt on one knee, "It was my negligence that allowed the assassin to infiltrate the castle, please punish me as you see fit."



"That's enough, you were not in the castle at the time, it has nothing to do with you."



"So..." Carter hesitated, "Could you tell me who exactly stopped the assassination attempt? From what I saw at the scene, they..." The knight swallowed, "It seemed like they were all killed by the same person, and they had no power to fight back."



"You can tell that?" Roland asked curiously.



"If it had been an evenly matched fight, the scene wouldn't have been so clean, and the wounds would have varied," Carter said in a low voice. "Everyone was lying in a small warehouse, and aside from blood and bodies, there was almost no damage to the items that were stored there. The large boxes used for storing salted meats didn't even have a mark on them. This means that person did not rely on any cover and moved around in a small open space. Forgive my directness, Your Highness, but this is simply inconceivable."



"I see." Roland nodded, understanding the implication. Theoretically, no matter how strong one is, being surrounded would put them at a severe disadvantage—in real combat, it wouldn't be like in movies where it looks like a surround, but people still come at you one by one. Attacks from blind spots would be particularly deadly. Therefore, when facing multiple opponents, the correct strategy is to rely on the terrain and environment to always face the enemy head-on.



However, Nightingale was not an ordinary person.



"Regardless, go and do what you need to do. This person cannot show themselves for now. When the time is right, I will tell you," Roland said.



Although the Chief Knight was loyal and reliable, and knew that Anna and Nana were witches, Roland still chose to conceal the existence of Nightingale. Because unlike the other two witches, she did not belong to him; her reason for staying in the town was solely for Anna. Behind her was the Witch Cooperation Association, and she would leave one day.



Carter left with a look of dejection.



Roland understood his thoughts. As a man who bore a sword, he had been practicing the swordsmanship that had been summarized and accumulated over hundreds of years and regarded it as the truth. But when faced with a scenario that he could not comprehend, he would inevitably doubt himself—if swordsmanship could be so exquisite, what then was his own pride worth?



"I thought you would call me out." Nightingale revealed herself, still sitting at the corner of the desk with her legs crossed.



"I was thinking the same. Why don't you just settle down here and become my shadow guard? I'll pay you two Gold royals a month, twice as much as Anna. Would you consider that?" Roland began to tempt her again. "A house with a garden, two days off a week, and paid leave every year—uh, that means you get paid while resting."



To his surprise, she didn't flatly refuse this time but smiled ambiguously, "I can't just abandon my companions."



"Then bring them all over. Once winter is over, Border Town is going to have a construction boom, and there'll be room for everyone. Plus... witches can walk the streets without discrimination, not seen as evildoers."



"Let's talk about that when you achieve it," Nightingale shrugged.



Alright, promoting takes time, and these things can only be done gradually. Roland changed the subject, "Nana has been safely sent back, right?"



"Uh-huh, she was pretty scared."



The prince sighed. When Nightingale woke him up at midnight and he saw the scene, he almost threw up. After a brief explanation of what happened, Roland instructed her to secretly bring Nana out. The little girl, who had only healed chickens before, fainted at the sight of a bloodied living person. After a lot of commotion, she finally managed to heal the patrol captain with tears all over her face.



To prevent her family from noticing, Nightingale also had to take responsibility for bringing her back.



By the time everything was settled, dawn was almost upon us.

"What do you make of this affair? Can you guess which of my dear brothers or sisters might be behind it?" 

Nightingale shook her head. "They were all from the patrol team, and the only exception had no identification on him that could be linked to his identity. If it was a case of bribery, anyone could have managed it... But I feel that this matter may have nothing to do with your siblings."

"Why do you think so?"

"Because it's too sloppy. A multi-person operation with infighting within the team. They didn't immediately commit suicide after the failure, leaving at least two alive. Plus, their behavior was far from professional at the time, more like street thugs. It's not in the style of your siblings; it seems more like a scheme concocted by amateurs. I think even if I hadn't been there, the assassination would have had no chance of success... Don't forget, Anna was sleeping just downstairs from you."

Nightingale picked up Roland's cup and took a sip of water nonchalantly, then continued, "Regardless, your knight has already gone to the dungeon to interrogate them for their testimony. I bet he'll get to the truth soon enough—compared to the pawns laid out by your sister, that guy was far inferior, he was even kneeling and begging me not to kill him earlier."

"The severely injured patrol captain... I seem to have summoned him before."

"Really?" Nightingale tilted her head. "I think you ought to thank him. If he hadn't single-handedly tied up the others, I wouldn't have discovered the rats sneaking into the basement so quickly. Although I'm not sure why he did it, the enemy of our enemy is our friend, right?"

Yes, Roland thought, but the point wasn't whether he was a friend or foe, but rather what Nightingale had said.



— "Our" friend.
