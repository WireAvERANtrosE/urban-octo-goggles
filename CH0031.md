## "Our" friend
Roland sat at his desk, lost in thought. He had not expected someone to actually dare to attack him in his own castle. If it hadn't been for Nightingale's timely discovery, he might have already fallen victim. 

Who could it be this time? His third royal sister, or one of his other siblings? They were being too hasty. The struggle for the throne was supposed to last five years, yet only a few months had passed. Roland slapped the table in frustration. This was absolutely outrageous. Couldn't they even let him spend the winter in peace?



Footsteps sounded from outside the door, and Chief Knight Carter Lannis entered the room. "Your Highness, we have identified the bodies. Of the eight corpses, seven were former patrol team members. The identity of the eighth is unknown. Among the two who are still alive, one is under the care of Miss Pine... no, the witch Pine, and has not yet awakened. The other has been imprisoned and is being closely guarded."



Patrol team? Roland gritted his teeth in anger. He knew he couldn't rely on this team, which had been nurtured by the previous lord. Eight out of ten had defected, proving that it was the right choice not to let them join the militia.



"Keep a close eye on the one in the dungeon. Don't let him commit suicide by poison like the last time."



"The... last time?"



"Ah, it's nothing," Roland shook his head. It seemed that being woken up by Nightingale in the early morning had left him confused. "In any case, I want to know everything from him. Who instigated this, who contacted, who bribed. I leave this investigation to you."



"Yes, Your Highness," Carter did not leave immediately after speaking, but knelt on one knee. "I failed in my duty by allowing the assassin to infiltrate the castle. I ask for your punishment."



"Enough. You were not in the castle at the time. This has nothing to do with you."



"So..." Carter hesitated, "Could you tell me who exactly thwarted the assassination attempt? From what I saw at the scene, they..." The knight swallowed, "They all seemed to have been killed by the same person, and they were unable to fight back at all."

"You could tell that?" Roland asked curiously.

"If the powers were evenly matched, the scene would not have been so clean, and the wounds would vary," Carter spoke in a low voice, "Everyone fell in a small warehouse, and except for the blood and bodies, there was hardly a damaged item. Even the large boxes used for storing pickled meat didn't have a scratch on them. This means that the person did not use any cover, but moved around in a small open space. Forgive me for being blunt, Your Highness, but this is simply incredible."

"I see." Roland nodded, understanding the other's meaning. Theoretically, no matter how strong a person is, when surrounded, they would fall into a very unfavorable situation—in actual combat, it wouldn't be like in the movies where it seems like you're surrounded, but people still come one after another. Attacks from blind spots can be particularly deadly. Therefore, when facing multiple opponents, the correct strategy is to rely on the terrain and environment, so that you can always face the enemy head-on.

However, Nightingale is no ordinary person.

"Anyway, you should go and do what you need to do. This person cannot show up for the time being, I will tell you when the time is right."

Although the chief knight is loyal and reliable, and knows that Anna and Nana are witches, Roland still chose to conceal the existence of Nightingale. Because unlike the other two witches, she doesn't belong to his side, she stays in the small town simply for Anna. Behind her is the Witch Cooperation Association, and she will leave here sooner or later.

Carter left with a disappointed look on his face.

Roland could understand his feelings. As a swordsman, he has been practicing the art of the sword, which was summed up and accumulated over hundreds of years, and considers it the truth. But when he sees an incomprehensible scene, he would inevitably doubt himself—if the art of the sword could reach such a level, what did his pride count for in his daily life?



"I thought you would call me out." Nightingale appeared, still sitting at the corner of the desk, dangling her legs as she spoke.

"I thought so too. Why not just settle down here, serve as my shadow guard, with a monthly salary of two Gold royals, twice as much as Anna. Would you like to consider it?" Roland started to persuade her again, "The house comes with a garden, two days off per week, and paid leave every year—uh, that means you get paid while you rest."

To his surprise, she did not flatly refuse this time but smiled ambiguously, "I can't just abandon my companions."

"Then bring them all over. As soon as winter passes, Border Town will start a major construction, there will be room for everyone. And... witches can walk on the streets without being discriminated against, no one will regard you as evil."

"Let's talk about it when you achieve that." Nightingale shrugged.

Well, the promotion depends on the product, and these things have to be taken slowly. Roland changed the subject, "Nana has been safely sent home, right?"

"Uh-huh, she was quite frightened."

The prince sighed. He was woken up by Nightingale at midnight and almost threw up when he saw the scene. After a brief explanation, Roland instructed her to secretly bring Nana out. The little girl, who usually only treated chickens, fainted immediately when she saw a bloodied man. After a lot of chaos, she healed the patrol captain tearfully.

To avoid her family's suspicion, Nightingale also had to take her back home.



When everything was done, dawn was approaching.



"What do you make of this? Can you guess which of my dear brothers or sisters might have done this?" 



Nightingale shook her head, "They were all patrolmen. The only exception didn't carry any identification related to his identity. If it's a matter of bribery, anyone could have done it... But I think, this matter may have nothing to do with your siblings."



"Why?"



"Because it's too sloppy. An operation involving multiple people, yet there was infighting within the team. They didn't commit suicide immediately after their failure, leaving at least two survivors. And at that time, their performance was far from professional, they were like street hooligans. This doesn't seem like the style of your siblings, but rather like the plotting of amateurs. I think even if I hadn't been there, this assassination attempt would probably have failed...Don't forget, Anna was just sleeping downstairs."



Nightingale picked up Roland's cup, took a sip of water without caring, then continued, "Anyway, your knight has gone to the dungeon to interrogate them. I bet he will find out the truth soon—compared to the pieces your sister has placed, that guy is much inferior. He was even begging me not to kill him."



"That seriously injured patrol captain...I seem to have met him before."



"Is that so?" Nightingale turned her head, "I think you should thank him. If it hadn't been for him holding off the others, I wouldn't have discovered the rat in the basement so quickly. Although I'm not sure why he did it, the enemy of our enemy is our friend, right?"



Yes, Roland thought, but the point wasn't whether he was a friend or an enemy, but what Nightingale had said.



—— "Our" friend.
