## Western Region Security Bureau
Back in the castle hall, Roland took his seat at the head of the room, looking down at the subjects gathered below.

In his memory, the fourth prince had exercised the right of judgment only once when he first arrived at Border Town. After falling out with the nobles and having a series of displeasing days, he had handed all affairs over to Barov and hadn't inquired since.

Seeing that everyone had arrived, Roland declared the start of the trial.

First, the parties were to state their cases, and then Roland would pose questions—with Nightingale's covert assistance, he didn't need to discern who was lying or speaking insincerely, nor did he need the meticulous mind of a Grim Reaper grade-schooler. Determining responsibility became easy and straightforward.

The truth of the matter quickly came to light.

Koya Havis, resentful of being stripped of his knighthood and tired of the tedious bureaucratic work at the town hall, vented his frustrations on the refugees. He took advantage of distributing porridge to deliberately charge the refugees and incited tension between them, claiming that it was because the serfs did not hand over all their grain that there was not enough wheat stock to distribute for free.

In reality, Koya had been collecting porridge fees for several days. Since he wore the distinctive town hall uniform, the refugees, fearing retaliation from officials, mostly kept silent, which only emboldened him further. It wasn't until today that a refugee named Ved stood up to protest against his actions, sparking an uproar and bringing the issue to light.

After understanding the situation, Roland breathed a sigh of relief.

An organization in its growth phase should be vibrant and full of energy. Although corruption and rigidity are inevitable once stability is achieved, those issues should only arise after the unification of Greycastle. If such problems emerged at the beginning, then the organization was doomed to not go far.



Now it seems that it was just Koya Harvis's personal actions that didn't involve more officials from the City Hall. And the matter was limited to extortion, not the most worrisome issue of colluding with serfs to resell and privately sell grain.



Of course, he himself was also responsible. The City Hall was desperately short of staff. Without any screening or training, he had simply warned them and then stuffed all the surrendered knights to Barov. As it turned out, not everyone could accept the job without complaints and endure the huge psychological gap from knight to civilian.



Roland called Barov to his side and asked in a low voice, "How would a lord usually deal with such a situation?"



"Your Highness, it depends on two scenarios," the latter respectfully replied, "If the offender is a noble, they can avoid any punishment after paying a few Gold royals, whereas for a commoner who attacks a noble, the crime can be big or small, ranging from amputation to flogging."



"But Koya is no longer a noble," the prince shrugged, "I stripped him of his title."



"Yes, Your Highness. In that case, the punishment is entirely up to the lord's mood."



"There's no set rule?"



Barov shook his head.



He frowned. To depend entirely on mood implied that however one dealt with commoners didn't matter; in the eyes of the nobles, they were not considered 'people' who needed to be treated with respect.



"Are there any more common punishments besides chopping off hands, cutting off legs, whipping, and pulling out fingernails? Like imprisonment."

"Imprisonment?" Barov was taken aback, "You mean just locking them up? What kind of punishment is that? The prison is only a temporary place for holding criminals, sooner or later they have to be brought out for trial. If you keep them locked up, you still have to provide them with food, I'm afraid in some people's eyes, this is already a kind of reward."

Alright, it seems that the commonly used fixed-term imprisonment of later generations is not applicable here, Roland thought for a moment, then decided to follow the rules of Greycastle. He stood up, his gaze sweeping across the entire hall, "I now pronounce the sentence."

"Koya Havis, for dereliction of duty and extorting refugees, is hereby stripped of all his positions in the City Hall, sentenced to ten years of labor in the mines, and fined three times the income he extorted."

"Vader, for initiating the attack on City Hall personnel, is sentenced to ten lashes."

"The rest of the refugees and serfs involved in the brawl are fined two Silver royals, or five lashes."

"The distribution of barley porridge will continue to be free, and all the money previously extorted will be returned." He looked to the chief official of the City Hall, "You are to carry out these verdicts and announce the results to the people of the temporary residential area."

"As you command, Your Highness." Barov bowed.

Returning to his office, Roland leaned back in his chair and stretched. Then he felt a pair of hands rest on his shoulders, gently kneading them.



He closed his eyes, enjoying this moment of leisure.

This matter made Roland realize that with the continuous increase in the number of subjects, the authority of the City Hall was expanding rapidly, and it was perhaps time to face the issue of internal supervision.

However, he did not want to establish an institution akin to a procuratorate, and even less did he wish to implement the independence of the public prosecution and law in this era. The former would require a large number of literate personnel, and it could easily become a political body prone to mutual attacks and shirking responsibilities, hindering the implementation and development of policies. The latter would be an indirect way of weakening the lord's power. It seemed better to keep the powers of legislation, interpretation, and adjudication in his own hands.

He needed a simple and effective system that could play a supervisory role without the need for too many people.

Roland grasped the hand on his shoulder.

Nightingale dissipated the fog, took the prince's hand, and sat back down at the table, tilting her head and asking, "What's wrong?"

Her slender legs swung back and forth by the edge of the table, her high-top deerskin boots, and tight leather pants forming a perfect curve.

Roland coughed twice, "I plan to establish a new department to oversee the City Hall and to apprehend other individuals or groups that might endanger the stability of the Western Region. This department will be solely responsible to me, completely independent of the City Hall and the First Army," he said deliberately, "I temporarily name it the 'Western Region Security Bureau', and I want you to be the director."

"Me?" she blinked.



"Indeed, only you can easily discern the truth from falsehood, and any deceitful tricks are meaningless in front of you," Roland nodded, "What do you say? If you're willing, I can offer you an afternoon tea with ice cream exclusively in the winter, and also..."

Nightingale pinched his hand gently, "Even without those offers, I would agree to help you—whatever you want to do."

"..." Roland suddenly felt somewhat embarrassed.

She smiled and did not let the silence linger, "But what should I do?"

"Well, the supervision part is simple," the prince adjusted his emotions, "I will set up a whistleblower box at the entrance of the castle district, and you will just need to verify the letters of accusation inside."

To resolve this issue with the least effort, undoubtedly, the best way was to mobilize public supervision and let the City Hall monitor itself, just like during the last year's Evil Months when spies infiltrated Border Town.

The difficulty with this method in later generations was that it required a significant amount of effort to verify both the target of the accusation and the accuser themselves, not to mention the instances of false reporting, errors, and deliberate framing. However, these drawbacks were non-existent in the face of Nightingale's abilities, as verifying information became effortless, simply by asking in person—if the accusation was accurate, a reward would be given; if it was false or a lie, punishment would follow. Based on these two points, the whistleblower system would undoubtedly be highly efficient.

"As for maintaining the stability of the Western Region, eliminating threats and hidden dangers, it's more like an internal intelligence system. I will gradually expand your manpower until your gaze can extend across the entire Western Region."
