## True Feelings
North Slope Mine, the backyard of the smelting area.
Nightingale picked up the glass goblet placed on the table and lifted it above her head. The crystal-clear cup shimmered in the light, without a hint of impurity to be seen.

She knew that this type of cup was called a crystal goblet, and the process and formula for making it had always been the royal alchemical workshop's most closely guarded secret. Just the high-stemmed goblet in her hand was worth around one Gold royal. Crystal glassware coupled with exquisite silver tableware had always been the favorites of nobles and wealthy merchants to show off their wealth.

And now, these crystal containers, brought from the palace, were soon to be transformed into raw materials for smelting.

"Your Highness, you're not burning cups, you're burning Gold royals," Nightingale remarked.

"I don't have time to study how to turn sand into colorless glass, so I have to make do with this method for now," Roland said, throwing a beautifully crafted crystal pitcher into the furnace made of Anna's black fire—Nightingale remembered the prince had once used it to serve barley beer, filling cups for the sisters at afternoon tea in the castle garden and at the Evil Months' victory banquet. She couldn't help but feel a tinge of regret.

Under the stable high temperature, the pitcher quickly softened and then turned into a sticky paste.

"Turn sand into glass?" Anna asked, "Are they the same substance?"

"Yes, the main components are pretty similar, but sand contains a lot of impurities, which makes the glass mostly brown or green, and not fit for use."

"So you're saying that glass is made from pure sand?" Roland smiled, "You could think of it that way. Once I write this part of knowledge into a book, you'll understand after reading it, how those tiny spheres make up matter."

I won't understand anyway... Nightingale pouted. Besides, the different colors of the glass don't affect its function as a container, and since you're not using it as a drinking cup, why insist on making it with transparent crystal. She walked over to Anna, looking over the glassware that had been recast.

Although they still appeared colorless and transparent, they looked very different from the previous crystal cups.

Some looked like tubes, round at the bottom, thin and long. Others resembled bottles, large at the bottom like a kettle, with only a thumb-thick bottleneck at the top.

The strangest was a tube bent into the shape of a horseshoe, open at both ends, barely even serving as a container.

"What do you plan to do with these crystal glassware?" Nightingale could not help but ask.

"It's not for me, but for the future alchemists of Border Town," Roland stirred the viscous liquid in the black fire with a glass rod, "They can use these vessels to extract some acids and alkalis, to produce the chemicals needed for manufacturing new weapons."

Acids? Alkalis? Chemicals? Nightingale blinked, realizing she didn't understand a word the prince was saying, which made her feel somewhat frustrated. But to ask about each one would seem too ignorant, and she did not want to reveal this side of herself in front of Anna, so she focused her attention on the only noun she could understand.

"Where in the town is there an alchemist? Even in Longsong Stronghold, there's no alchemy workshop. You can only find an alchemist in Redwater City, and I've heard that their salaries are higher than those of a lord's ministers; they can't be recruited with just Gold royals alone."
"You seem to know quite a lot," Roland responded with a smile. "That's indeed the case. The people I've sent are already on their way to Redwater City, and we should have news in about two weeks. But I'm not recruiting them with Gold royals, rather with some secrets of alchemy. As for whether I can recruit them or not, I'm not sure, but I have to try."

The prince's initial words of praise instantly dispelled Nightingale's gloom, and she returned to the center of the courtyard contentedly, picking up a piece of pastry from the round table and stuffing it into her mouth.

Ever since Roland moved the main experiment site from the castle's backyard to the burning room on the northern slope, the afternoon tea had also been relocated there.

The round table was laden with court snacks specially made by the chef at the prince's behest.

Take this snack called a "steamed bun," for example. Its skin is made from ground wheat flour that has been processed in some way, becoming incredibly soft and sticky. Inside is a filling of minced meat, chopped into fine bits, full of juice... not like salted meat that is hard and difficult to swallow. As soon as you bite into it, the minced meat and the juice blend together.

Nightingale sucked each of her fingers clean and reclined in a lounge chair, feeling a wave of sleepiness wash over her.
Had she been getting lazier lately?

The afternoon sun bathed her in a watery warmth, enveloping her gently. The rustling of the leaves in the spring breeze brought a profound sense of tranquility to her heart. She kicked off her shoes, curled up her legs, and lay down on her side.

This perspective allowed a view of the side door in the backyard leading to the gunpowder workshop, with a gauze curtain still hanging at the entrance, probably a measure His Highness had taken to guard against her sneaking in. Thinking of this, Nightingale couldn't help but find it amusing. Whether it was the dividing wall of the yard or the exterior wall of the workshop, for her, they were as good as flat ground she could freely traverse. She had also once entered that mysterious room, quietly staying aside and listening while His Highness explained the production method, only she never took away any finished gunpowder.

Yet the other party thought he had done everything without being noticed, completely unaware that he was the one who was kept in the dark.

Nightingale shifted her head, looking towards Anna.

She was holding a freshly made flat-bottomed cup, talking about something with His Highness, her expression serious and focused.

Nightingale felt a deep admiration for this woman who came from a common family but was brimming with genius.

That the sisters of the Witch Union could escape their destitute fates and free themselves from the torment of magic backlash was largely due to Anna—if she hadn't changed the prince's view of witches, none of the subsequent turning points would have happened.

If His Highness was really going to marry a witch, Anna was almost the only choice Nightingale could think of.

Despite the flicker of hope in her own heart, Nightingale chose to bury it deep within. Most of the time, just being by His Highness's side was enough to fill her with contentment.

She closed her eyes, and an image involuntarily emerged in her mind.

Roland ascended to the throne in the grand hall of the palace, wearing a golden crown and holding a jeweled scepter, he walked towards the castle balcony to accept the admiration and cheers of the people.

Beside him, the woman in a white silk dress, arm in arm with him, was Anna. She too wore a glittering crown on her head, her face veiled, smiling and waving to the citizens.

Lightning circled in the sky, scattering bright red rose petals, and from the distance, the bell tower of the capital tolled melodiously.

She stood alongside her sisters, applauding and sending their blessings.

An increasing drowsiness spread throughout her body, and her consciousness began to blur.

Roland turned around, lifted the woman's veil, and lowered his head to kiss her on the lips.

The final scene became very blurry, and as the veil fell to the ground, Nightingale faintly saw that the woman with closed eyes... was herself.

She curled her lips into a smile and fell into a deep sleep.
