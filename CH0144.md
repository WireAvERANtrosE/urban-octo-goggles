## True Feelings
North Slope Mine, the backyard of the smelting room.



Nightingale picked up the glass goblet placed on the table and lifted it above her head. The crystal-clear body of the goblet shone brightly under the light, without a hint of impurity to be seen.



She knew that this type of goblet was called a crystal cup, and the manufacturing process and formula had always been a closely guarded secret of the royal alchemy workshop. Just the goblet in her hand was worth around one Gold Royal. Crystal glassware paired with exquisite silver tableware had always been the favorites of the nobility and wealthy merchants to show off their wealth.



And now, these crystal containers brought from the palace were soon to be turned into raw materials for melting.



"Your Highness, you're not burning cups, you're burning Gold Royals," Nightingale remarked.



"I don't have time to study how to make colorless glass from sand, so I have to make do with this method for now," Roland said as he tossed a beautifully shaped crystal pitcher into the furnace made of Anna's Blackfire—Nightingale remembered the prince had once used it to serve barley beer, filling cups for the sisters during afternoon tea in the castle garden and at the celebration banquet for the Evil Months, and she couldn't help feeling a bit of regret.



Under the stable high temperature, the pitcher quickly softened and then turned into a puddle of sticky paste.



"Using sand... to make glass?" Anna asked, "Are they the same substance?"



"Mm, the main components are similar, but sand contains a lot of impurities. The glass produced is mostly brown or green, which does not meet the requirements for use."



"So you're saying glass is made from pure sand?"

Roland laughed, "You could think of it that way. Once I write down this knowledge into a book, you'll understand after reading it once how these tiny spheres constitute matter."

I won't understand anyway... Nightingale pouted. Besides, the different colors of glass don't affect their function as containers. After all, you're not using them as drinking cups, so why insist on making them with transparent crystal glass? She walked over to Anna and examined the glassware that had been recast.

Though they still appeared colorless and transparent, they looked very different from the crystal cups before.

Some looked like tubes, round at the bottom and long and thin. Others resembled bottles, with a bottom as large as a kettle and an opening only as thick as a thumb at the top.

The strangest was a tube bent into the shape of a horseshoe, open at both ends, hardly serving as a container at all.

"What do you plan to do with these crystal glass containers?" Nightingale couldn't help asking.

"It's not for me to use, but for the future alchemists of Border Town," Roland stirred the sticky substance in the black fire with a glass rod, "They can use these containers to extract certain acids and alkalis, to produce the chemicals needed for my new weapons."

Acids? Alkalis? Chemicals? Nightingale blinked, finding herself completely unable to understand what His Highness was talking about, which was a bit frustrating. However, asking about each term seemed too ignorant, and she didn't want to expose that side of herself in front of Anna, so she decided to focus on the only noun she could understand.



"Where in the town would there be an alchemist? Even the Longsong Stronghold doesn't have an alchemy workshop. You can only find alchemists in Redwater City, and I've heard that their salaries are even higher than those of the lord's ministers. It's very difficult to recruit them with just Gold Royals."

"You seem to know quite a lot," Roland responded with a smile. "That's right. The people I've sent are already on their way to Redwater City, and we should have news in about two weeks. However, I'm not recruiting them with Gold Royals, but with some secrets of alchemy. As for whether I can recruit them or not, I'm not certain, but I have to give it a try."



The first half of the Prince's praise immediately dispelled Nightingale's gloom, and she returned to the center of the courtyard contentedly, picking up a piece of pastry from the round table and stuffing it into her mouth.

Ever since Roland moved the main experimental site from the backyard of the castle to the burning chamber on the North Slope Mountain, afternoon tea had also been relocated there.

The round table was laid with specially made palace snacks ordered by His Highness.

Take, for example, this snack called "baozi." Its skin is made from ground wheat flour and had been processed in some way, making it incredibly soft and glutinous. Inside was a ball of meat filling, minced into tiny bits, containing juices... It wasn't like salted meat that was hard and difficult to swallow. With just one bite, the minced meat would blend with the juices.

Nightingale sucked on her fingers one by one and leaned back in the lounger, a hint of drowsiness washing over her.

Had she become lazier recently?

The afternoon sun cast warm, water-like beams over her, enveloping her slowly. The rustling sound of the spring breeze fluttering through the leaves brought a profound sense of tranquility to her heart. She kicked off her shoes, curled up her legs, and lay down on her side.



This perspective allowed a view of the side door to the backyard that led to the gunpowder workshop, with a gauze curtain hanging at the doorway, probably a precaution His Highness had taken against her sneaking in. Thinking of this, Nightingale found it somewhat amusing. Whether it was the courtyard's dividing wall or the outer wall of the workshop, for her, both were as easily traversable as flat ground. She had also entered that mysterious room before, quietly standing aside and listening while His Highness explained the manufacturing process, only she never took any of the finished gunpowder.



Yet he thought he had been stealthy and unnoticed, completely unaware that he was the one being kept in the dark.



Nightingale shifted her head, looking towards Anna.



She was holding a freshly fired flat-bottomed cup, talking about something with His Highness, her expression serious and focused.



Nightingale felt a profound admiration for this woman, who came from a common family yet overflowed with talent.



The sisters of the Witch Cooperation Association were able to escape their destitute fates and free themselves from the torment of magic backlash largely because of Anna—if it were not for her changing the prince's view on witches, none of the subsequent changes would have been possible.



If His Highness were truly to marry a witch, then Anna was almost the only choice Nightingale could think of.



Despite the slight hope in her heart, Nightingale chose to bury it deep inside. Most of the time, just being by His Highness's side was enough to make her content.



She closed her eyes, and involuntarily, an image formed in her mind.



Roland ascended to the throne in the royal palace's grand hall, wearing a golden crown and holding a gem-encrusted scepter, he walked towards the castle terrace to receive the admiration and cheers of the people.

Beside him, clad in a long white satin dress, walking arm in arm was Anna. She too wore a sparkling diadem on her head, covered by a veil, smiling and waving to the people in greeting.

Lightning circled in the sky, scattering bright red rose petals, and from afar, the bell tower of the royal capital tolled with resonant chimes.

She stood alongside her sisters, clapping and sending their blessings.

An increasing feeling of drowsiness spread throughout her body, and her consciousness began to blur.

Roland turned around, lifted the woman's veil, and lowered his head to kiss her on the lips.

The final scene became very blurry, and as the veil fell to the ground, Nightingale faintly saw that the woman with her eyes closed... was herself.

She curved her lips into a smile and fell into a deep sleep.
