## Escape
I don't know how long it was, but when Nightingale woke up, she found her hands tied behind her to a wooden stake, her waist and feet also bound with ropes. She struggled a bit, but her body was pressed tightly against the pole, unable to move at all.



She tried to use her powers, but the familiar sensation did not appear—her connection with magic seemed to have been cut off. Nightingale looked down and saw a transparent, faceted stone hanging around her neck.



"You're awake," Cara walked in front of her, "How does it feel to be poisoned by petrification venom? To be honest, I had high hopes for you, Nightingale. However, you have disappointed me."



"..." Nightingale took a deep breath, "You actually have a God's Punishment Army's lock, Cara, do you realize what you're doing?" The shackles originally used by the church to suppress witches were now being used by their mentor against her own kind! What angered her even more was that the crowd around her had an indifferent expression, as if they saw nothing wrong with this. Damn it, Nightingale shouted in her heart, don't you realize that you are becoming the very type of person that witches once hated the most?!



"It's just a tool, and occasionally there are some naughty children who don't listen to teachings and need to be punished," Cara said nonchalantly, "And you, Nightingale, are the one who needs to be punished. Or should I call you Veronica? A woman born into a noble family who has fallen to become a witch, still thinking of climbing to a high position?"



"I don't understand what you're talking about."



"You disappoint me so much. When Wendy rescued you from the clutches of the nobility, I thought you would firmly stand by the side of the Witch Cooperation Association. Look at what you've done now. Just when everyone is about to find the Holy Mountain, you want to ruin this great situation!" Cara shook her head and sneered, "Leading the sisters to seek refuge with a prince? Either you have been domesticated for too long, with servility ingrained deep within, needing to find a master to know how to live; or... you want to sell them all to the nobles, to regain your former status!"



"Everything I have done is for the sisters of the Witch Cooperation Association," Nightingale suppressed her anger, as cursing out loud was meaningless now, "I hope they no longer suffer from the torment of the Awakening Day, and that they can live a life without worrying about food and clothing. I have no intention of stopping your plans; the sisters should have the freedom to choose their own way of life. Border Town is undergoing earth-shattering changes, and the steam engine blueprint I brought is one of them. It can operate on its own and is incredibly powerful. With such a machine, water can be hoisted directly from the gully, sparing people from the daily trouble."



Cara let out a cold laugh, "Is this what you're talking about?" She turned around, took a stack of parchment scrolls from another witch behind her, and waved them in front of Nightingale, "Although I can't understand what all these drawings are, do you expect me to believe that a pile of cold iron pieces can move on its own like a living being? Do you think we are all three-year-old children?"



She walked to the brazier and threw the scroll into the burning charcoal.



"No!" Nightingale cried in vain, watching helplessly as the design turned to ash in the brazier.



"My patience has run out. Now I'll give you one last chance," Cara pulled a red-hot iron spike from the brazier, "If you confess to all the sisters of the Witch Cooperation Association that you were bewitched by the nobility, I can spare your life. However, the whipping cannot be avoided, as a lesson for your gullibility. If you continue to be delusional, I will have to drive this spike through your heart and nail your body to the stake as a warning to others." She spoke slowly and deliberately, "Do not miss my final act of mercy, make your decision."



Nightingale stared at the iron spike as it inched closer, feeling the burning heat from its tip. If she were still the timid girl she used to be, she would have admitted her wrongs by now. But she had left her past behind and was no longer that cowardly girl. She was Nightingale, a powerful witch, and even death could not make her yield.



She closed her eyes, waiting for the final moment to arrive. For some reason, the image of Roland appeared in Nightingale's mind.



"Stop!" someone shouted, and she was startled, opening her eyes. Wendy walked out from the crowd and said to Cara, "Teacher, look at the white cloth wrapped around your arm. We have already experienced so many farewells. Do you really wish to add another?"



"What, have you been deceived by her as well? Wake up, Wendy, those are all lies!"



"I don't know," Wendy shook her head, "I don't intend to go with her to Border Town, but there is one thing I think she's right about—we sisters should have the freedom to choose our own way of living."



She turned back and asked loudly, "Is there anyone else who wants to leave with her?"



The crowd remained silent, with no one answering, and the scene fell into a hush.

"So just let her leave on her own," Wendy said. "She hasn't done anything to harm the Witch Cooperation Association, I can't just watch you kill her."



At this point, Nightingale had completely understood Wendy's intention. A wave of sorrow couldn't help but rise in her heart. Even Wendy did not fully trust her. That's why she kept silent when she needed her help to convince everyone. But she was still the kind-hearted witch who cared for everyone, even if she disagreed with her views, she would still reach out to help.



After Wendy spoke these words, murmurs spread through the crowd, and then a few more people stood up.

"Yes, since she wants to return to the secular world, let her go."

"The Church and illnesses have already taken so many of our sisters, Your Excellency, please think it over."

"Shut up, all of you!" Cara burst out in rage, "Just letting her go like this, what if a second or third Nightingale appears? If she sells the location of our camp to the Church, we will have nowhere to escape!" Before she could finish her sentence, she thrust out the iron spike in her hand, but Wendy was quicker, conjuring a gust of wind that blew Cara away.



Then she tossed a coin, waving her hand, and a rapid current of air enveloping the coin whooshed towards Nightingale. The airflow vanished instantly when it approached Nightingale, but the coin, still carrying its inertia, hit precisely against the God's Punishment Stone on her neck.



The clear, faceted stone shattered upon impact.



"Traitor!" Cara screamed as she climbed up from the ground. She extended her left and right hands towards Wendy and Nightingale, and two snake shadows appeared out of thin air. One opened its mouth wide and bit viciously onto Wendy's hand, while the other lunged and missed its target.



The rope fell to the ground, still in the shape it had been when used to bind, but Nightingale had vanished.



Realizing her opponent's ability, Cara broke out in a cold sweat. She summoned all her magic power, and the magic snakes, flickering with various colors, swarmed out from her chest to form a wall of snakes, while she herself quickly retreated—



However, Nightingale was faster.



With just one step... merely one step forward, she had already appeared behind Cara. Reaching out with both hands, the iron spike that should have pierced Nightingale's heart instead went straight through Cara's body.
