## Shadow Islands
"The bay has countless islands; no one has ever reached the edge of these seas," said a tall man with a rugged and unrestrained appearance. "The further east you go, the more unpredictable the climate becomes, and so do the islands. It's hard to imagine just how strange they can get."



"Even you haven't reached the end?" Tilly asked curiously. "They say you're the most outstanding explorer of the bay, and that aside from you, hardly anyone dares to cross Scorched Island and continue eastward."



"Hahaha," he laughed heartily. "That's just exaggerated praise. In fact, every year there are brave baymen who venture east, but it's rare to make any new discoveries. Violent hurricanes and sudden fogs make it impossible for ships to make any progress."



He was Thunder, Ashes thought, the explorer who first discovered the Shadow Islands. But since he disappeared in a shipwreck two years ago, many thought he had perished. Unexpectedly, he appeared on Sleeping Island and even reached an agreement with the fifth princess—opening up new routes for Sleeping Island, charting the seas, and searching for more relics. Tilly, in turn, sent witches to assist him in his explorations. As for the two missing years, he hadn't mentioned them, and Tilly kept silent, but Ashes felt that Her Highness must know what happened, or else they wouldn't have such an understanding. This made Ashes slightly uncomfortable.



"Like the hurricane yesterday?"



"Exactly, it came in the blink of an eye and was gone just as quickly," Thunder shook his pipe, scattering the ashes into the sea before refilling it with some leaves and lighting it. "If it weren't for that incredible witch—"



"Her name is Molly." Ashes reminded him stiffly.



"Ah, right, look at my memory," Thunder didn't mind, scratching the back of his head and smiling. "If it weren't for Molly, we probably would have capsized. Her abilities are simply amazing. I often think that perhaps witches are the most suitable explorers."



"We already have one, don't we," Tilly said with a slight smile, "…a witch who has inherited the title of the most outstanding explorer."



"Uh..." Thunder took a deep puff from his pipe, exhaling a long stream of smoke, "Let's hope so."

Here we go again, Ashes frowned, unable to understand the conversation between the two men. She decided to leave the bow and walked to the stern to calm her emotions. Princess Tilly seemed to be very eager to explore the ruins, immediately preparing for a sea voyage after clearing the cathedral in the fjord. What surprised her was that Her Highness insisted on going personally, and no amount of persuasion from her could change the princess's mind.

Moire was sitting at the stern, her magic servitor holding a fishing rod, learning to fish from the sailors. Although the sailors were somewhat resistant to witches when they first boarded the ship, their attitudes had changed dramatically since the hurricane the day before—Moire's summoned magic servitor had expanded rapidly, enveloping the middle part of the sailboat within itself, impervious to the fierce winds and torrential rain. Though the boat rose and fell with the waves, it remained stable. Now, every sailor regarded the witch as a bringer of luck, even saying they would not dare go to sea without a witch accompanying them.

"Ashes, look at the big fish I caught!" Moire pointed to a bucket behind her, in which lay a scaleless sea fish with a sharp-pointed snout, very different from the river fish they saw in Greycastle.

"What is this?"

"A swordfish, it likes to follow ships, and sometimes its sharp snout can puncture the bottom of the boat," a sailor answered, "But it's very delicious to eat, especially the meat in the belly, which melts in your mouth like ice," he smacked his lips, "Tonight everyone will enjoy the fresh taste of boiled swordfish."

"I think I've got another fish on the line!" Moire exclaimed excitedly.

A shadow appeared under the green water, growing larger as the magic servitor pulled up the rod, soon about to surface.

"This... this is," the sailor was stunned, "No, throw the fishing rod away!"



Before the words had even finished, a strange creature leaped out from the water, opening its wide mouth and aiming straight for Molly. It seemed about to swallow its prey whole, but Ashes was faster. With her left hand, she scooped up the little girl and with her right, she swung her great sword, smacking it down onto the attacker's head.

The beast let out a pained shriek, smashed down from the air, its six legs scratching frantically, trying to flee back into the water. But Ashes did not give it the chance. She set down Molly and with both hands drove her sword downward, nailing the creature to the deck.

It twitched for a moment, blowing out a string of white bubbles from its mouth, and soon lay motionless.

"What is this?" It was only now that Ashes had the chance to take a closer look at the monster before her—it somewhat resembled a fish, but with short legs like a crab's, a round mouth that opened nearly as wide as its body, lined with dense, matted teeth. The most nauseating part was the pair of furry arms on either side of its mouth, ending in five-fingered hands, looking eerily human.

"A mutated Sea Ghost!" A sailor patted his chest, still shaken, "They often disguise themselves as fish, grabbing fishermen with their bite and dragging them into the water. And it's said that only Sea Ghosts that have eaten humans will grow hands!"

"That last bit is just a rumor." Someone spoke up from behind. Ashes turned to find that both Thunder and Tilly had approached.

"Captain Sir!" The sailor stuck out his tongue and promptly made way.

"The more sensational the tale, the less accurate it is," Thunder said, stepping forward to kick the creature on the ground, "In fact, it has a name that you might be more familiar with."



"What?" Ashes asked.

"Evil beasts." He enunciated each word.

"Thunder, the fog is coming!" the lookout suddenly shouted.

"All hands, be sharp!" Thunder ordered loudly, "Lower the sails, we are entering the Shadow Islands!"

Ashes noticed that the sky, which was clear just a moment ago, had suddenly darkened, and the emerald sea had turned ink-green, as if a blot of ink was spreading beneath the water. In no time, the ship was enveloped in a thick fog, and standing at the stern, she could no longer see the figures at the bow clearly.

"What's going on?" Tilly couldn't help but grab Ashes's arm.

"It proves we're on the right course," Thunder said with a smile. "When the Shadow Islands emerge from the sea, this area will be shrouded in thick mist. Of course, what's actually happening is that the tide is receding, about thirty feet or so, and the significant drop generates a lot of vapor. Plus, with reefs everywhere, it's easy to run aground and sink. I need your witches to help prevent the ship from being wrecked."

The group made their way to the bow, and, as they did when facing a storm, Molly had her magic servants envelop the bow, trying to swell up as much as possible, with part of their bodies sinking into the water, so that if there were underwater reefs, the servants would sense them first.

"If we didn't have witches, what would you do?" Ashes asked.



"Then we can only rely on patience and luck," Thunder sighed. "The fleet will send out small boats to scout ahead and ensure the path is clear before the larger ships follow. But the sea in this region is not calm, just like the demonic beasts you saw before. The closer we get to the Shadow Islands, the more numerous they become. Fog, reefs, monsters... That's why many explorers come here, but few can find the entrance to the ruins."



After sailing for about an hour, the fog gradually lifted, and Ashes saw more and more islands around them, but with scarce vegetation—only glowing green moss or algae, and many shellfish creatures climbing over them. "Are all these islands submerged underwater?"



"That's right, just like Sleeping Island, but here the intervals between high and low tide are much shorter, occurring about once every half month," Thunder answered. "And the speed of the rise and fall is extremely fast, almost as if there's a huge hole underneath, crazily swallowing the surrounding sea water. I even suspect that the changes in the sea level of the entire fjord are related to this place. If we're lucky, we might even witness the main island rising from the seabed."
