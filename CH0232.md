## Shadow Islands
"The Fjords have countless islands, and no one has ever reached the border of these islands," said a tall man with a rough and hearty appearance. "The farther east you go, the more unpredictable the climate becomes, and so do the islands. It's hard to imagine how strange they can ultimately get."



"Have you never reached them either?" Tilly asked curiously. "They say you're the most outstanding explorer of the Fjords, and aside from you, hardly anyone dares to cross Scorched Ridge to continue eastward."



"Ha ha ha," he laughed heartily. "That's all exaggerated praise. In fact, every year there are brave people from the Fjords who venture east, but it's rare to find anything new. The raging hurricanes and sudden fog make it difficult for ships to make any progress."



He was Thunder, Ashes thought, the explorer who first discovered the Shadow Islands. But since he went missing in a shipwreck two years ago, many thought he had met with misfortune. Unexpectedly, he appeared on Sleeping Island and reached an agreement with the fifth princess—tasking him with opening new sea routes for Sleeping Island, charting the seas, and seeking more new relics. Tilly had sent witches to assist him in his explorations. As for the missing two years, she had not heard him mention it, and Tilly also kept silent about it, but Ashes always felt that Her Highness knew the inside story, otherwise the two would not be so in sync. This made Ashes feel slightly displeased.



"Like the hurricane yesterday?"



"Exactly, it appeared in the blink of an eye and vanished just as quickly," Thunder said, shaking his pipe to sprinkle the ashes into the sea before refilling it with some leaves and lighting it again. "If it hadn't been for that amazing witch—"



"Her name is Molly," Ashes interjected stiffly.



"Ah, right, look at my memory," Thunder said, unabashed, scratching the back of his head with a smile. "If it hadn't been for Molly, I'm afraid the ship would have capsized. Her abilities are simply incredible. I often think, perhaps witches are the most suitable explorers."



"There already is one, isn't there," Tilly said with a slight smile, "…the witch who inherited the title of the most outstanding explorer."



"Uh..." Thunder took a deep draw from his pipe, expelling a long stream of smoke, "Let's hope so."



Here we go again, Ashes thought, frowning. She couldn't understand a word the two men were saying. She simply left the bow and walked to the stern to calm her emotions. Princess Tilly seemed very eager to explore the ruins; after clearing the bay's church, she immediately began preparing to set sail. What surprised her was that the princess insisted on going personally, and no amount of persuasion could dissuade her.



Molly was sitting at the stern, her magical servant holding a fishing rod, learning to fish with the sailors. Although the sailors were somewhat resistant to witches when they first boarded, their attitudes changed drastically after yesterday's hurricane—Molly's summoned magical servant rapidly expanded, enveloping the midsection of the sailboat, impervious to the violent winds and rain. Despite the boat's heaving on the waves, the hull remained stable. Now, every sailor regarded the witches as a lucky charm, even saying they wouldn't dare to set sail without a witch in the future.



"Ashes, look at the big fish I caught!" Molly pointed to a bucket behind her, in which lay a scaleless sea fish with a sharp, pointed snout, very different from the river fish seen in Greycastle.



"What is this?"



"Swordfish, they like to follow ships, and sometimes their pointed snouts can puncture the bottom of the boat," the sailor replied, "But they are very delicious, especially the meat from the belly. It melts in your mouth like ice," he smacked his lips, "Tonight everyone will get to enjoy fresh boiled swordfish."



"I think I've got another bite!" Molly exclaimed with delight.



A dark shadow appeared beneath the green water, growing larger as the magical servant worked the rod, and was about to surface.



"This... This is," the sailor hesitated, "No, quickly throw away the rod!"



Before the words were finished, a bizarrely shaped creature leaped out of the water, opening its huge mouth, and aimed straight for Molly.

Just as it was about to swallow its target whole, Ashes was faster. She scooped up the little girl with her left hand, and with her right, she swung her greatsword, smacking it down on the attacker's head.

The monster let out a pained screech, forcibly smashed down from the air, its six legs flailing wildly, attempting to escape back into the water. But Ashes did not grant it that chance. She set Molly down and with both hands drove her sword downwards, nailing the creature directly to the deck.

It convulsed for a moment, spitting out a string of white bubbles from its mouth before quickly becoming motionless.

"What is this?" It was only now that Ashes had the opportunity to take a closer look at the monster before her—it somewhat resembled a fish, yet had short legs like a crab's. Its mouth, when opened, was circular and nearly as big as its body, filled with dense, matted teeth. The most repulsive thing was that, on either side of its mouth, it had a pair of furry arms, ending in five fingers, looking just like human hands.

"A mutated Sea Ghost!" the sailor said with a still trembling heart, patting his chest, "They often disguise themselves as fish, grab fishermen with their mouths, and drag them into the water. And it's said that only Sea Ghosts that have eaten humans grow hands!"

"The latter part is but a rumor," someone said from behind. Ashes turned around and saw that both Thunder and Tilly had come over.

"Captain!" the sailor stuck out his tongue and immediately stepped aside.

"The more sensational the rumor, the less accurate it is," Thunder stepped forward and kicked the creature on the ground, "In fact, it has a name that you might be more familiar with."



"What?" Ashes asked.

"Evil beasts." He articulated every word.

"Lord Thunder, the fog is rising!" the lookout suddenly shouted.

"Everyone, be alert!" Thunder ordered loudly, "Lower the sails, we are entering the Fogsail area!"

Ashes noticed that the sky, which had been fairly clear just a moment ago, had suddenly turned gloomy. The emerald green sea had turned into an inky green, as if a mass of ink was spreading underwater. In a short while, the ship was enveloped by a thick fog, and standing at the stern, she couldn't even see the figures at the bow clearly.

"What's happening?" Tilly couldn't help but grab Ashes' arm.

"It proves that we are going in the right direction," Thunder said with a smile, "When the Shadow Islands emerge from the sea, this area will be filled with thick fog. Of course, the correct term should be that the sea water is receding, about a dozen zhang in magnitude, and the huge drop will produce a large amount of water vapor. Combined with the reefs everywhere, it is easy to hit a reef and sink. I need your witches to help prevent the ship from being wrecked."

The group came to the bow of the ship, and just like when they were combating a storm, Molly had her magic servant wrap around the bow, trying to expand as much as possible, partially submerging into the water, so that even if there were hidden reefs, they would be sensed by the servant first.

"If there were no witches, what would you have done?" Ashes asked.



"We can only rely on patience and luck," Thunder sighed. "The fleet will send out small boats to scout ahead and ensure the passage is clear before the larger ships follow. But the sea in this region is not calm, just like the demonic beasts you saw earlier. The closer we get to the Shadow Islands, the more numerous they become. Fog, reefs, monsters... this is why many explorers come here but few can find the entrance to the ruins."



After sailing for about an hour, the fog gradually lifted, and Ashes saw more and more islands surrounding them, although they were mostly devoid of vegetation, covered in green moss or algae, with many crustaceans clinging to them. "Are all these islands submerged underwater?"



"That's right, just like Sleeping Island. However, the intervals between high and low tide here are much quicker, occurring about once every half a month," Thunder replied. "And the speed of the rise and fall is extremely fast, almost as if there's a huge hole in the seabed that's furiously swallowing the surrounding seawater. I even speculate that the changes in the sea level of the entire gulf are related to this place. If we are lucky, we might even witness the main island rising from the seabed."
