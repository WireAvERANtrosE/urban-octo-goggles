## Nightingale
"Please don't be impulsive, Your Highness. I have no intention to harm you; I am only here to talk with you."
Damn it, who keeps someone for a talk like this? Roland swallowed, slowly turning around. Under the threat of the dagger, he had no choice but to do as the other party said.

In the dim candlelight, Roland saw the other person—she was sitting at the edge of his bed, her whole body hidden under a robe, her head covered with a hood, making it impossible to see her true face. The candlelight cast her shadow onto the wall behind her, occupying most of the wall space.

"Who are you?"

"I have no name. My sisters call me 'Nightingale,'" she stood up, lifting the corner of her robe, and curtsied in a perfect noblewoman's gesture, "First of all, I would like to express my gratitude to you, Prince Roland Wimbledon."

Gratitude? Roland noticed that the pattern on the other party's robe shone uniquely under the firelight, with three triangles arranged side by side, resembling an eye... It seemed familiar.
— 'The pattern on the coin... the Sigil of the Holy Mountain and the Evil Eye, it's the emblem of the Witch Cooperation Association.'

Suddenly recalling Barov's words, he blurted out, "You... are a witch!?"

"Hehehe," she let out a series of light laughs, "Your Highness is indeed well-learned."

Upon hearing the other party admit her identity, Roland quietly breathed a sigh of relief. It was good that she wasn't an assassin sent by his siblings. "You came to this remote town for the witch from the North Slope Mine? Although I don't know where you got the news from, it's too late to come now. If I really wanted to hang her, she would have been dead by now."

"I know that. And if you had really done so, I wouldn't have just wanted to talk to you..." Nightingale sat back on the bed, "The Cooperation Association doesn't like it when someone interferes in mundane affairs, especially those related to royal power. But I'm not too keen on listening to them. Killing a prince for a witch might be too much, but I can still leave a lasting impression on you."

A naked threat. Roland actually felt more at ease, "She's alive and well."

"I know, and there's also a young girl named Nana," she nodded, "I arrived here a week ago, but I haven't met you in person. I've seen everything you've done, though I don't quite understand why you don't harbor the usual malice towards witches that common folks have. Regardless, I would like to express the Witch Cooperation Association's gratitude on their behalf."

"A week ago you were already..." Roland wiped his forehead, 'seen everything I've done?' Could it be that this person had been following him all along without his notice? "Well, you said you wanted to talk, but you didn't come just to say thanks, did you?"

"Aren't you tired of talking while standing?" she said as she took off her hood, "Please come over here. I'm not frightful to look at; I won't scare you, Your Highness."

Far from being unattractive, she was actually beautiful. As the hood fell, Nightingale's golden curly hair cascaded like a waterfall, with the candlelight slowly spreading golden speckles; her nose was high, her eyes lively. Unlike the somewhat youthful faces of Anna and Nana, her features exuded a mature charm. Although it was difficult to see clearly in the dim light, the well-placed shadows on her face were enough to prove her beauty.

Roland slowly walked over and sat down beside the bed. He wasn't lured by the other person's appearance to the point of forgetting the danger; he simply felt that the other party bore no ill will.
"Now you may speak."
"Indeed, you're not afraid of me," the woman's voice seemed somewhat pleased, "You are different from the others I have met... They hate us because they fear us. I can see the fear in their eyes, but you..." She couldn't help but reach out and gently stroke Roland's cheek, "You are only curious."
Roland coughed awkwardly twice and turned his head away. Hey, hey, let's not change the atmosphere so quickly, okay? It was just a moment of assassin's creed, and now it's suddenly turned into an overbearing president vibe.
Fortunately, the other party quickly reined in her emotions, "I am here to tell you that I want to take Anna and Nana away."
"No!" Roland was startled and blurted out. Then he worried that such a straightforward refusal would anger the other party, so he quickly added, "They are doing well here, no one can harm them. Besides, where do you plan to take them? No place could be safer than here."
"To the Witch Cooperation Association, that is where they belong," Nightingale didn't turn hostile because of the rejection; she continued in a calm tone, "All members of the Witch Cooperation Association are their companions, there is no discrimination, no persecution... and they no longer need to disguise themselves."
"Where is the Witch Cooperation Association located? You don't have a fixed place to stay, right? A month ago, my guards found your camp in the Misty Forest, and the tracks showed you were heading north... What's in the north? Nothing but endless mountains!"
"You are right, the Witch Cooperation Association is now somewhere in the Impassable Mountain Range, and it is absolutely safe for witches there."
"Living like savages in the mountains during winter, how is that safe? Is there clean drinking water? Enough food? Warm shelter? And the Demonic Month is approaching, the entire northwest will become a land of danger. What are you all thinking—" Roland suddenly paused, wait a second, what had Barov said? 'Only when witches go to the Holy Mountain, can they find true peace. The purpose of the Witch Cooperation Association is to gather the witches together to search for the Holy Mountain.' Damn it, could it be... "Are you planning to search for the Holy Mountain within the Impassable Mountain Range?"
"I cannot tell you that," Nightingale said with a wry smile, but her expression clearly told Roland that he had guessed correctly.
"In that case, I absolutely refuse," Roland rejected outright, "In two months, the whole Outland will be the domain of the demonic beasts. Even if you can avoid humans in the mountains, you can't escape the demonic beasts. How about this? The Holy Mountain can be searched for at any time; why not come to Border Town to spend the winter, and then continue your search after winter is over?"
This time it was Nightingale's turn to be stunned, "The Witch Cooperation Association move here? You... really are an interesting person," she pondered for a moment but eventually shook her head, "Your Highness, even if you are not afraid of witches, your people are. And once we expose ourselves to the public eye, the Church's henchmen will soon come knocking."
As long as the witches can help us safely get through the Demonic Month, my people will realize that they are not evil. But before Roland could speak, the other party stopped him, "Additionally, the reason I want to take them away is that Anna is about to come of age."
"Come of age?"
"Yes," sensing the confusion in Roland's heart, Nightingale calmly explained, "Coming of age is the first hurdle that all witches must overcome, and the earlier one becomes a witch, the harder it is to survive this threshold. Your Highness, do you know why we are seen as the incarnation of the devil?"
