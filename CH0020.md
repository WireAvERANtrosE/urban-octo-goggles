## Nightingale
"Please don't act rashly, Your Highness. I have no intention of harming you; I am here only to talk with you."

Damn it, who would hold a conversation like this? Roland swallowed, slowly turning around. Under the threat of the dagger, he had no choice but to do as the other party said.



In the dim candlelight, Roland saw her—she was sitting on the edge of his bed, her whole body enshrouded in a robe, with a hood covering her head, making it impossible to see her true face. The candlelight cast her silhouette against the wall behind her, occupying most of the wall space.



"Who are you?"



"I have no name, my sisters call me 'Nightingale'," she rose to her feet, lifting the hem of her robe and curtsying in a perfect noble's gesture, "First of all, I would like to express my gratitude to you, Prince Roland Wimbledon."



Gratitude? Roland noticed that the patterns on her robe shimmered uniquely in the light of the fire, three triangles in a row, resembling an eye... It seemed familiar.

—'The pattern on the coins... the mark of the Holy Mountain and the Demon Eye, it's the emblem of the Witch Cooperation Association.'



Suddenly recalling Barov's words, he asked, "You... are a witch!?"



"Hehehe," she let out a series of light chuckles, "Your Highness is truly well-learned."



Hearing the other party admit her identity, Roland breathed a sigh of relief. It was good that she was not an assassin sent by one of his siblings. "You came to this remote town for the witch from the Northern Slope Mine? Although I don't know where you heard the news, it's too late now. If I really wanted to hang her, she would have been dead already."



"I am aware of that. And if you had really done so, my reaction would not have been limited to just wanting to talk to you..." Nightingale settled back onto the edge of the bed, "The Witch Cooperation Association doesn't like interference in mortal affairs, especially those related to royal power. But I'm not particularly keen on listening to them, and killing a prince for a witch might be too much, but I can certainly leave a lasting impression on you."



A naked threat. Roland, on the other hand, felt reassured, "She's alive and well."



"I know, there's also a young girl named Nana," she nodded, "I arrived here a week ago but just haven't met you in person. I've seen everything you've done, and although I don't quite understand why you lack the common malice towards witches, I would like to express my gratitude on behalf of the Witch Cooperation Association."



"A week ago..." Roland wiped his forehead. 'So she's seen everything I've done?' Could it be that she has been following him all this time without his awareness? "Alright, you said you wanted to talk, but surely it's not just to say thanks?"



"Aren't you tired of standing while talking to me?" she said as she slipped off her hood, "Please come this way to talk. I'm not so frightening in appearance that I would scare Your Highness."



It's more than just not being ugly, she's actually quite beautiful. The moment the hood fell, Nightingale's golden curly hair cascaded down like a waterfall, with golden specks slowly spreading out in the candlelight; her nose was high and sculpted, her eyes sparkled with vitality. Unlike Anna and Nana's somewhat youthful faces, her features exuded a mature charm. Although under the dim light it was hard to see the details, the well-placed shadows on her face were enough to prove her beauty.



Roland slowly walked over and sat beside her on the bed. He wasn't so much drawn by her appearance as to forget the danger, he just genuinely felt no malice from her.



"Now you can speak."



"Indeed, you are not afraid of me," the woman's voice sounded somewhat pleased, "You are different from the others I have met... They hate us because they fear us. I can see the fear in their eyes, but you..." She couldn't help but reach out, gently caressing Roland's cheek, "You are only curious."



Roland coughed awkwardly and turned his head away. Hey, hey, let's not change the atmosphere so quickly, okay? It was just like in Assassin's Creed, how did it suddenly become like a domineering CEO vibe?



Fortunately, the other party quickly regained composure, "I came here to tell you that I am taking Anna and Nana away."



"No!" Roland blurted out in shock. Then, worried that such a blunt refusal would anger her, he quickly added, "They are doing very well here; no one can hurt them. Moreover, where do you plan to take them? There is no place safer than here."



"The Witch Cooperation Association is where they belong," Nightingale didn't get upset because of the refusal, she still spoke in an even tone, "The members of the Witch Cooperation Association are their companions, with no discrimination, no persecution... They won't need to disguise themselves anymore."



"Where is the Witch Cooperation Association? You don't have a fixed foothold, do you? A month ago, my guards found your camp in the Misty Forest, and the tracks showed you were heading north... What's in the north, only endless mountains!"



"You are right, the Witch Cooperation Association is currently somewhere in the Impassable Mountain Range, and for witches, it is absolutely safe."



"Living in the mountains like savages during the winter, how is that safe at all. Is there clean drinking water? Is there enough food? Is there warm shelter? Moreover, the Evil Months are approaching, and the whole northwest will become a land of danger, what on earth are you thinki—" Roland suddenly stopped, wait a minute, what had Barov said? 'Witches can only find true peace by going to the Holy Mountain. The purpose of establishing the Witch Cooperation Association was to gather witches to search for the Holy Mountain together.' Damn it, could it be... "You are planning to search for the Holy Mountain in the Impassable Mountain Range?"



"Please forgive me, I cannot disclose that," Nightingale smiled bitterly, but her expression clearly told Roland that he had guessed correctly.



"Given that, I will absolutely not agree," Roland flatly refused. "In two months, the entire wilderness there will be dominated by demonic beasts, and even if you can avoid humans in the mountains, you won't be able to hide from the beasts. How about this instead—you all come to Border Town to spend the winter, and it wouldn't be too late to search for the Holy Mountain after the winter is over."



This time, it was Nightingale's turn to be stunned. "Us moving here? You... are truly an interesting person," she pondered and eventually shook her head. "Your Highness, even if you aren't afraid of witches, your people are. And once we are exposed to the public eye, the Church's claws will quickly come knocking at our door."



As long as the witches help us smoothly get through the Evil Months, my people would realize that they are not evil beings. However, before Roland could speak, the other party stopped him, "Also, there's another reason why I want to take them away—Anna is about to come of age."



"Come of age?"



"That's right," Nightingale calmly explained, sensing the confusion in Roland's heart, "Coming of age is the first major hurdle that all witches must overcome. Generally, the earlier one becomes a witch, the harder it is to endure this hurdle. Your Highness, do you know why we are regarded as the incarnations of the devil?"
