## The abrupt beginning
Three days quickly passed, and the defensive line was essentially complete.



Roland stood on the high platform behind the position, just like when Evil Months confronted the demonic beasts, inspiring all the soldiers of the First Army with his presence on the battlefield.



Nightingale, due to her special mission, had already taken Echo to infiltrate the battlefield, and the witch who took over the protection duty by his side was Anna.



Roland himself was also wearing coated armor, with two revolvers tucked at his waist. Unless the defensive line completely collapsed, it would be difficult for any lucky stragglers to pose a threat to him.



"The enemy is about ten kilometers away from here, coo!" A giant pigeon descended from the sky, landing on his shoulder.



"Well done, continue monitoring." Roland took out a piece of beef jerky from his pocket and held it to Maggie's beak. She pecked and swallowed the jerky in a few bites, then spread her wings and flew off to the east.



With Lightning and Maggie's alternating reconnaissance, he had a clear understanding of the enemy's movements, which allowed him to arrange the battlefield with composure.



Facing the berserk warriors high on drugs, forming a thin battle line was not secure, especially after Lightning's report that the several hundred short spears carried by the enemy were of particular concern to him. If he was not mistaken, those were likely the enemy's weapons for a pre-emptive strike.



The range of general throwing weapons would not exceed fifty meters, but that was for ordinary people. Roland was not very clear how far the militia, after taking the pills, could throw their short spears, but once it exceeded a hundred meters, it would pose a threat to the musketeer battalion. So he simply chose to lay down a number of bunkers, implementing urban warfare tactics, using buildings to block paths, muskets to seal roads, and artillery to suppress the enemy, constructing an almost insurmountable defensive line.



With an adequate supply of cement, building bunkers quickly was even easier than erecting city walls. Although the single-layer brick bunkers appeared somewhat fragile in structure, they were already impregnable fortifications for the militia who did not carry heavy siege equipment.



Ten bunkers were arranged in a diamond shape on both sides of the road, forming interlocking fields of fire. Each bunker was staffed with twenty-four soldiers, half veterans and half recruits, with the skilled veterans responsible for shooting and the recruits for loading ammunition. Soraya had also painted the bunkers with "optical camouflage." From a distance, the bunkers blended almost seamlessly with the surrounding environment, making it difficult to distinguish any difference between them.



Behind the front line was the artillery corps, with twenty cannons lined up in a row. The firing sequence remained the same as the last time, adjusting the cannon's firing angle and loading the corresponding ammunition according to Lightning's signal.



There was also an emergency force of about a hundred men standing around the artillery position, armed with flintlock guns, to protect the artillery and His Highness the Prince in the rear.



Looking at the spirited and high-moraled soldiers on the defensive line, Roland felt somewhat emotional. The subjects, who had initially been frail and enlisted for the sake of an egg, had undergone the trials of the Months of Demons and the town's defense battle and were now capable of shouldering the responsibility of defending their homeland.



"Your Highness, the enemy is only two kilometers away from us," reported the little girl Lightning, who had just flown back.



"Good, leave the surveillance to Maggie. You can enter the forest above and signal for the artillery fire," Roland nodded, then turned and said to the Chief Knight, "Pass down my command, all members of the First Army, take battle positions and prepare to meet the enemy!"



"Yes!" Carter saluted.



Raymond felt his hand growing heavier by the minute.

It was a searing pain just two days ago, but now it was almost numb. His swollen and bruised arm could no longer fit into the armor, and the spot hit by the hammer bore a dark red mark. The skin looked shiny, as if covered in a layer of oil, somewhat translucent and gleaming.

It must be a broken bone, he thought; without treatment, this arm would be lost. The painkillers scavenged from the church could ease the pain but wouldn't mend a broken bone. He decided that as soon as the battle was over, he would immediately return to the capital. There, the best apothecaries and alchemists of Greycastle should be able to heal this damn internal injury.

"Sir Raymond, your hand... are you sure it's alright?" Leven asked with concern.

"It looks worse than it is," he said nonchalantly, "Besides, we don't need to lift a finger to attack Border Town; we just need to watch from the sidelines."

"I hope the pain in your arm hasn't clouded your judgment, my lord," Dorn scoffed, "Have you thought about how we're going to attack the town?"

Raymond frowned at the tone, but now was not the time to quibble over such trivialities, "According to information gathered from the Wolfheart and Elk nobles, they mainly rely on a long-range weapon to halt the knights' charge. This weapon can attack before the knights gain speed, accompanied by flames and a loud boom, similar to a large crossbow, but the projectiles it fires are much faster than bolts."

"In other words, despite its immense power, it can't fire continuously, right?" Leven quickly grasped the key point.

"Exactly, the faster we approach their defense line, the less we'll be attacked," Raymond nodded, "Additionally, numbers are very important. As I understand it, the Knights of the Duke of Lion, together with the conscripted noble knights, totaled no more than two hundred men, and they were just one step away from breaking through the defense line. However, we have a full fifteen hundred. These fools, after taking the medicine, can run almost as fast as horses, so the outcome will be completely different from last time."



"Or none of this will happen," Dorn said dismissively. "Roland Wimbledon might still be in the castle waiting for the envoy's visit. We just need to walk into the castle boldly and chop off his head."



"No, he must have noticed us," Leman said decisively. "Haven't you realized that we haven't encountered any caravans in the past three days? Merchants leaving from Longsong Stronghold might have chosen to stay put or turn back after seeing the tail of a large force, but not seeing any caravans leaving from the town is unusual. This can only mean that the prince has sealed off the border."



"Now do you understand why His Majesty chose Sir Leman to be the captain instead of you?" Levin mocked.



"Alright, it seems your head is still working fine," Dorn shrugged. "That's good, killing those lowly people who dare to resist His Majesty Timothy is obviously more interesting than just killing the prince."



"Sir Leman, we have spotted the forces of Border Town ahead," the knight in charge of scouting reported back.



"Let's go take a look," Leman urged his steed forward. At this moment, the outline of the town's castle was faintly visible, and there seemed to be figures moving at the end of the road. He pulled out his telescope and observed the defensive line the other side had set up. "Those things with wheels should be the long-range attack weapons mentioned in the intelligence, but there seem to be many more of them."



"Should we have everyone charge directly?" Levin asked.



"This road is a bit narrow, I'm afraid it won't accommodate all the militia," he looked towards the woods on the right. "We can split off some men to go through the forest, it doesn't matter if they are slower. If we can form a pincer attack from the side, this defensive line won't last long."



Just as Leman was about to give the order to adjust the formation, something white caught his eye from the corner of his vision.



He was stunned for a moment. Was this an illusion caused by his severed arm? Turning his head, to his surprise, it was a woman. She wore a hood and her entire body was shrouded in a white robe. Before he had the chance to speak, a burst of firelight suddenly appeared in her hands.



Raymond only felt as though his head had been fiercely struck by a hammer, and the world spun into darkness.
