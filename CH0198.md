## The sudden opening
Three days passed quickly, and the defensive line was essentially constructed.

Roland stood on a high platform behind the position, inspiring all the soldiers of the First Army with his presence on the battlefield, just like Evil Months against the demonic beasts.

Nightingale, due to her special mission, had already taken Echo to infiltrate the battlefield, and the witch who took over the protection duty by his side was Anna.

Roland himself was also wearing coated armor, with two revolvers tucked at his waist. Unless the defensive line completely collapsed, the few that managed to slip through would hardly pose a threat to him.

"The enemy is about ten kilometers away from this place, coo!" A giant pigeon descended from the sky, landing on his shoulder.

"Good job, continue monitoring." Roland took out a piece of beef jerky from his pocket and held it to Maggie's beak, who pecked and swallowed it in a few bites, then spread her wings and flew eastward.

With Lightning and Maggie taking turns scouting, he had a clear understanding of the enemy's movements, allowing him to calmly arrange the battlefield.

Facing the drug-fueled berserk soldiers, forming a thin battle line was not secure, especially since Lightning's report mentioned hundreds of short spears carried on their backs, which particularly caught his attention as a probable preemptive strike weapon.

The range of general thrown weapons wouldn't exceed fifty meters, but that was for ordinary people. Roland was not sure how far the militiamen could throw the short spears after taking the pills, but once it exceeded a hundred meters, it would pose a threat to the musketeers. So he simply chose to set up a number of bunkers, implementing urban warfare tactics, using buildings to block paths, muskets to seal roads, and artillery to press the formation, constructing an insurmountable defensive line.



With sufficient cement, constructing bunkers quickly is easier than building city walls, and although the single-layer brick bunkers appear somewhat fragile in structure, they are impregnable fortifications against militias without heavy siege equipment.

Ten bunkers are arranged in a diamond formation on both sides of the road, creating crossfire. Each bunker is staffed with twenty-four soldiers, half new recruits and half veterans, with the skilled veterans responsible for shooting and the recruits for loading ammunition. Soraya has also painted "optical camouflage" on the bunkers, making them blend almost seamlessly with the surrounding environment when viewed from a distance, making it difficult to distinguish any difference between them.

Behind the front line is the artillery, with twenty cannons lined up. The firing sequence remains the same as last time, adjusting the firing angle and loading the corresponding ammunition according to the signals from Lightning.

Around the artillery positions stands an emergency unit, about a hundred strong, armed with flintlock guns to protect the artillery and His Highness the Prince in the rear.

Looking at the spirited and high-moraled soldiers in the defensive line, Roland felt somewhat emotional. The initially frail serfs who enlisted for the sake of an egg, after the trials of the Evil Months and the town defense battle, were now capable of shouldering the responsibility of defending their homeland.

"Your Highness, the enemy is only two kilometers away from us." This time, the report comes from the little girl Lightning.

"Good, let Maggie take over the surveillance task. You can enter the airspace above the forest to release the artillery signals," Roland nodded, then turned to the Chief Knight and said, "Pass my order: all members of the First Army, take battle positions and prepare to meet the enemy!"

"Yes!" Carter saluted.



Raymond felt his hand growing heavier by the moment.

It had been a fiery pain two days before, but now it was almost numb. The swollen, bruised arm could no longer fit into the armor, and the spot where the hammer had struck bore a dark red mark. The skin looked as if it were coated with a glossy sheen, slightly transparent and shiny.

The bone must be broken, he thought, and without treatment, the arm would be lost. The painkillers scavenged from the church could ease the agony but would not mend broken bones. He decided that once the battle was over, he would immediately return to the capital. There, the best apothecaries and alchemists of Greycastle should be able to treat this damnable internal injury.

"Sir Raymond, your hand... are you alright?" Levin asked with some concern.

"It looks worse than it is," he said nonchalantly. "Besides, we don't need to lift a finger in the attack on Border Town. We just have to watch."

"Let's hope the pain in your arm hasn't muddled your thinking, my lord," Dorn scoffed. "Have you figured out how to attack the town?"

Raymond frowned at the tone, but now was not the time for petty squabbles. "According to the information gathered from the nobles of the Wolf and Elk families, their main defense against the knight's charge relies on a long-range offensive weapon. This weapon can attack before the knights gain speed, accompanied by fire and thunder, similar to a large crossbow. However, the projectiles it fires are much faster than crossbow bolts."

"So, in other words, although it's powerful, it can't fire continuously, right?" Levin quickly grasped the key point.

"Exactly. The faster we close in on their line of defense, the less we will be attacked," Raymond nodded. "Numbers are also crucial. According to what I know, Duke Ryan's knights, combined with the conscripted nobles, amounted to no more than two hundred men, and they were just one step away from breaking through the defense line. We, on the other hand, have fifteen hundred men. These fools, after taking the drugs, can run almost as fast as horses, so the outcome will be completely different this time."



"Or maybe none of this will happen," Dorn said dismissively, "Roland Wimbledon might still be in the castle waiting for the delegation to visit. We just have to walk into the castle and chop off his head."



"No, he must have noticed us by now," Leiman said decisively. "Haven't you noticed that we haven't encountered any caravans in the past three days? It's not strange for the merchants coming from Longsong Stronghold to stop or turn back after seeing the tail of a large army, but not seeing any caravans from the towns is unusual. This can only mean that the prince has sealed off the border."



"Now do you understand why His Majesty chose Sir Leiman as the captain instead of you?" Levin mocked.



"Alright, it seems your head is still working fine," Dorn shrugged, "This is better. Compared to just killing the prince, it's obviously more interesting to take out those lowlifes who dare to resist His Majesty Timothy."



"Sir Leiman, scouts have spotted the troops of Border Town ahead," reported a knight responsible for reconnaissance.



"Let's go have a look," Leiman spurred his mount forward. The outline of the town's castle was faintly visible, and there seemed to be figures moving at the end of the road. He took out his spyglass and carefully observed the defensive line set up by the other side, "Those things with wheels must be the long-range attack weapons mentioned in the intelligence reports, but there seem to be many more of them."



"Should we charge directly with everyone?" Levin asked.



"This road is a bit narrow, I'm afraid it won't fit all the militia," he looked towards the woods on the right, "We can split off some men to go around through the forest. It doesn't matter if they're slower. If we can form a pincer attack from the side, this defensive line won't last long."



Just as Leiman was about to order an adjustment to the formation, a flash of white in the corner of his eye suddenly caught his attention.



He was stunned for a moment, was this... an illusion caused by the severed arm? Turning his head, it was actually a woman. She wore a hood and was enveloped in a white robe. Before he had a chance to speak, a burst of flame suddenly appeared in her hands.



Raymond only felt as though his head had been fiercely struck by a hammer, the world spun as he fell into darkness.
