## Theater Conflict
Longsong Stronghold, theater auditorium.



As the audience's whistles and cheers continued unabated, the curtain slowly fell. May wiped the sweat from her forehead and looked at Irene, who was watching her with excited and expectant eyes, and gave a slight nod.



This affirmation made Irene cheer out loud, and as soon as the curtain hit the ground, she couldn't help but rush forward and give May a big hug.



"Hahaha, did I really perform okay?"



Annoyed, May rolled her eyes and pushed her away, "You've made some progress, enough to perform on stage alone."



"Miss May, what about me?" another witch actress, Rosia, asked cautiously.



"You're still far from it," she said without hesitation, "Your expression is stiff, your movements are slow, your lines lack emotion, you made two mistakes in the second act, one in the fourth, which are typical signs of not knowing the script well."



"Haha, Miss May is really strict," Carter said, scratching the back of his head, "But the audience response seems pretty good, listen, the applause hasn't died down yet."



"Most of these people have never been to a theater before, the play is a novelty to them," May stated bluntly, "If it were a regular performance, those mistakes would have been enough for the nobles to boo." She paused, "If you want to pursue a career as an actor, don't be satisfied with temporary success. Only by constantly improving yourself can you stand firm on the stage."



"Yes, thank you for your guidance!" Everyone bowed in unison.

May sighed, here it came again, even though she was not really a drama tutor for these people. But she was too lazy to fuss over such trivial matters, "Alright, keep up the good work. 'The Witch Diaries' has been scheduled through September, and we have several more rounds of performances to go. This is a rare opportunity, don't miss it."

"Yes!"

May had received a notice from the Ministry of Education a month ago, requesting the entire troupe to perform at Longsong Stronghold. The so-called entire troupe was actually a few ragtag actors who had followed her to the frontier, plus Irene Hilt.

Perhaps it was an agreement reached between His Highness the Prince and the agent, Peter, that a series of slots had been specifically cleared at the theater for the troupe to perform the ‘The Witch Diaries’ trilogy. Thus, this group of actors, unpolished in their craft and not even considered newcomers, were grandly stepping onto the stage of the stronghold theater. Normally, they would hardly be chosen even for a cameo role as an extra, but now they were appearing on stage in significant roles, and even performing alongside May, the star of the Western Region. It was hard not to marvel at the fickleness of fate.

Backstage, May couldn't help but frown.

She saw a group of people in the dressing room making a commotion, seemingly arguing about something. When they saw May and her group appear, more than a dozen people, led by a woman, crowded around.

These were the theater's actors, and May recognized the woman leading them, Bella Dean, a somewhat famous actress who belonged to a different troupe. Some nobles had considered her the biggest competitor to the star of the Western Region, but in reality, whether in terms of acting skills or reputation, May had always firmly surpassed her.

"Guess what I saw?" Bella circled around May, step by step approaching Irene, "A bunch of lousy actors who ran away from some backwater place."



"What did you say?" Irene asked in confusion, while Gait and Rosia's expressions stiffened, and they couldn't help but take two steps back.



"Pfft," Bella covered her mouth and said, "Look, she still doesn't know her own status." Her words provoked a burst of laughter from everyone. "Well then, let me be blunt, a big city like Longsong Stronghold is not a place for you, and the Stronghold Theater does not welcome such lowly and vulgar third-rate performances. What 'Witch's Diary'? It's nothing but the struggles and wails of a few lost dogs. Who would be interested in watching such nauseating plays? You might as well roll back to Border Town where you belong."



"You—" Irene's face flushed with anger, "What do you mean by third-rate performance? Didn’t you hear the cheers from the audience?"



"Ha, the audience?" Bella sneered disdainfully, "You call those people who deal with mud, hoes, and kilns every day an audience? Don't make me laugh! Even if a few monkeys were put on stage to prance around, they would cheer loudly as well! Would they have spare money to watch your performance if the tickets weren't free?"



"I…" Irene opened her mouth but didn't know how to retort.



"The theater has arranged your performances three times a week, and the income has already dropped several times, affecting even us—if our plays are scheduled together with yours, the nobles simply won't come to watch!" Bella raised her voice, "Who would want to sit on chairs covered with mud and grease? If it were me, I wouldn't want to step into a theater in disarray after a bunch of country bumpkins' revelry."



The other party was obviously here to pick a fight, May thought. The sudden insertion of the small town troupe indeed squeezed out many people's chances to perform, but Bella Deen was not much affected. From the news she gathered from some acquaintances, after she left Longsong Stronghold, the theater intended to make her the new star of the Western Region, so it was impossible to cancel the plays she starred in.



Thus, Bella's actions had a clear purpose. She seemed to be scolding Irene and the others, but in reality, she was targeting herself—if these people backed down, she wouldn't be able to continue performing 'Witch's Diary' on her own, and could only return to Border Town in disgrace. In this way, it would be as if Bella had defeated her in a direct confrontation, while also restoring the opportunities for other actors to perform, inevitably raising her prestige and establishing her status as the new star of the Western Region.



But she would never let herself be someone else's stepping stone.



"The revenue of the theater has decreased, are you serious?" May turned around, speaking casually, "You come to such a naive conclusion because the theater is running at a loss due to the waiving of ticket fees. It's undeniable that the theater operator has reached an agreement with His Highness the Prince and Lord Peter. The missing funds will naturally be covered by the Border Town City Hall. This is a commercial contract, not child's play. You really should use your brain, instead of shouting and screaming here based on your wild guesses."

"You... what nonsense are you talking about!"

"Furthermore, it's only you bunch of poor-performing, motley actors whose income has decreased," she smiled slightly, "I once performed at the open-air theater in King's City, the Abel Theater. It happened to drizzle on the day of the performance, yet the nobles still filled all the seats. So you're saying it's because of the commoners that they're unwilling to come and watch the performances? No, they just don't particularly enjoy making a special trip to watch a group of monkeys perform."

"..." A strange silence fell over the scene, and not only did no one step forward to accuse her, there wasn't even anyone who offered an explanation.

"One last point, you say 'The Witch Diaries' is lowbrow and vulgar, the struggle and wailing of a lost dog?" May's lips curled, her voice turning ice cold, "Perhaps I forgot to tell you, the script for this story was written by His Highness Prince himself. Are you trying to say that His Highness's ideas are lowbrow and vulgar? Insulting the royal nobility is punishable by the cutting out of the tongue. Do you still intend to stick to your view?" She looked towards the crowd behind Bella, "Or is there anyone among you who wants to try?"

Under her gaze, more than a dozen actors began to back away.

"Enough!" Bella gritted her teeth, "Since you went to Border Town, you shouldn't have come back! You think I don't know, May! The reason you went to that broken place wasn't to see that idiot Irene, but for Dawn—"

"Slap!"

Her voice stopped abruptly, a bright red palm print appeared on her left cheek, and Bella touched her face in disbelief, "You, you dare to hit, hit..."



Sigh, I was still too impulsive, May took a deep breath. This might bring some trouble for her.

Sure enough, two male actors walked out from behind Bella, "Miss May, what you did was a bit much."

"Don't you know how important appearance is to an actor? I think you at least owe her an apology."

Apology? Wouldn't that be admitting she was wrong? May sneered inwardly. Impulsive as she might have been, she didn't think she had anything to apologize for.

She glared at the two slicked-up men, and couldn't help but recall what Carter Lannis had said.

"Don't think that just because men are strong, they don't have weaknesses. Their eyes, throat, if attacked, can render them powerless in an instant, and of course... there's between the legs. If you're agile and decisive, it's not impossible to bring down a man much stronger than you."

Although she wasn't quite sure how she had ended up discussing this with him, she was ready to kick out, just waiting for the men to come a little closer...

Just then, the door to the dressing room was violently pushed open, and a knight clad in armor walked in, followed by several warriors holding long spears. As they entered the room, they had already pointed their spear tips at the crowd.

"I heard someone here was slandering Prince Roland, even harboring malice towards His Highness's crew?"



May couldn't help but freeze, she blinked her eyes, thinking she was seeing an illusion. However, everything remained unchanged, and she saw the smile that the other party stealthily revealed to her—the knight before her was indeed Carter Lannis.
