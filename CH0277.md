## Theater Conflict
Longsong Stronghold, the theater auditorium.



As the audience's whistles and cheers continued unabated, the curtain slowly fell. May wiped the sweat from her forehead and looked at Irene, who was looking at her with excitement and anticipation, and nodded slightly twice.



The affirmation made Irene cheer out loud. As soon as the curtain touched the ground, she couldn't help but rush forward and hug May tightly.



"Hahaha, did I really perform okay?"



Annoyed, May rolled her eyes and pushed her away, "You've made some progress, enough to perform on your own."



"Miss May, what about... me?" another witch performer, Rosia, asked cautiously.



"You are still far from it," she said without hesitation, "Your expressions are stiff, movements slow, lines lack emotion, you made two mistakes in the second act, and one in the fourth act. It's typical of not having memorized the script well."



"Haha, Miss May is really strict," Gatro said, scratching the back of his head, "But the audience's response seems quite good, listen, the applause has not even died down yet."



"These people are mostly commoners who have never been in a theater before; drama is a novelty to them," May said bluntly, "If it were an ordinary performance, those few mistakes would have been enough to elicit boos from the nobility." She paused, "If you want to continue on the path of acting, don't be satisfied with momentary success. Only by continuously improving yourself can you stand firm on the stage."



"Yes, thank you for your guidance!" Everyone bowed their heads in unison.



May sighed. Here it came again. She wasn't even really a drama tutor for this group of people. But she couldn't be bothered to quibble over such a trivial matter. "All right, keep up the good work. 'The Witch Diaries' has been scheduled until September, and we still have several rounds to go. This is a rare opportunity, don't miss it."



"Yes!"



May was notified by the Ministry of Education a month ago to have all members of the troupe perform at Longsong Stronghold. The so-called full members were the motley crew of actors who had followed her to the border, plus Irene Hilt.



Perhaps Prince His Highness and the agent, Petro, had reached an agreement, the theater specially cleared a series of slots for the troupe to perform the 'The Witch Diaries' trilogy. Thus, this bunch of actors, who were awkward in performance and couldn't even count as newbies, grandly took to the main stage of the fortress theater. Normally, they would hardly be chosen even as a supporting role that showed their face, but now they were appearing on stage in important roles, and even performing alongside herself, the star of the Western Region, which made one marvel at the fickleness of fate.



Backstage, May couldn't help but frown.



In the lounge, a group of people were making a racket, seemingly arguing about something. Upon seeing May and her party appear, more than a dozen people, led by a woman, surrounded them.



These people were all actors from the theater, and the woman leading them, May recognized, was Bella Dean, an actress with a bit of fame, belonging to a different troupe than her own. Some nobles had once thought her to be the biggest competitor to the star of the Western Region, but in reality, whether in terms of acting skills or fame, May had always firmly overshadowed her.



"Guess what I saw?" Bella walked around May, step by step, approaching Irene, "A bunch of lousy actors who sneaked back from some backwater place."



"What are you saying?" Irene asked with a puzzled face, while Gatro and Rosia's expressions stiffened, involuntarily taking two steps back.

"Pfft," Bella covered her mouth, "Look, she doesn't even know her own status." This remark elicited a burst of laughter from the crowd, "Then let me put it straight, a big city like Longsong Stronghold is not a place for you, and the stronghold's theater doesn't welcome such lowly and vulgar third-rate performances. 'The Witch Diaries' is nothing more than the struggles and wails of some destitute dogs. Who would be interested in watching such nauseating drama? You'd better roll back to Border Town sooner rather than later."

"You—" Irene's face turned red, "What do you mean by third-rate performance? Didn't you hear the cheers from the audience?"

"Ha, the audience?" Bella sneered dismissively, "You call those who deal with mud, hoes, and kilns every day the audience? Don't make me laugh! They'd cheer just as loudly if you put a few monkeys up there to parade around. Would they have the spare money to watch your performance if the tickets weren't free?"

"I..." Irene opened her mouth but didn't know how to rebut.

"The theater has arranged three shows a week for you, and the income has already dropped by several percentages, affecting even us—if our plays are scheduled together with yours, the nobles simply won't come!" Bella raised her voice, "Who would want to sit in a chair full of mud and grease? If it were me, I wouldn't want to step into a theater that's been trashed after a bunch of country bumpkins' revelry."

The other party was clearly looking for trouble, May thought. The sudden inclusion of the town theater troupe indeed squeezed out many people's opportunities to perform, but Bella Deane hadn't been too affected. From what she had learned from some acquaintances, after she left Longsong Stronghold, the theater intended to turn her into the new star of the Western Region, and naturally, they wouldn't cancel the plays she starred in.

Thus, Bella's purpose was very clear. She seemed to be chastising Irene and the others, but in reality, she was targeting herself—if these people backed down, she couldn't go on with 'The Witch Diaries' alone, and would have to return to Border Town in disgrace. In doing so, Bella would have defeated her in a direct confrontation, while also restoring the opportunities for other actors to perform, inevitably raising her prestige and establishing her status as the new star of the Western Region.

But she would never let herself become a stepping stone for others.



"The income of the theater has dropped, are you serious?" May turned around, speaking nonchalantly, "You think just because they've waived the ticket fee that the theater is running at a loss, how naive. The theater operator has undoubtedly reached an agreement with His Highness the Prince and Lord Petrov, and the shortfall will naturally be made up by the Border Town's municipal hall. This is a business contract, not child's play. You should really use your head instead of shouting your baseless assumptions here."



"You... What nonsense are you spouting!"



"Moreover, the only ones whose income has decreased are you bunch of actors with poor acting skills," she said with a slight smile. "I once performed at the open-air theater in King's City, the Averlon Theater. Unfortunately, it began to drizzle on the day of the performance, yet the nobles still filled all the seats. So you're saying it's because of the commoners that they're unwilling to come watch the play? No, they just don't fancy coming all the way to watch a bunch of monkeys perform."



"..." The place fell into an eerie silence, no one stood up to accuse her, and not even a single person retorted.



"And finally, you said 'The Witch Diaries' is vulgar and crude, the struggles and wails of a lost dog?" May's lips curled up, but her voice was icy cold, "Perhaps I forgot to tell you, the story of this play was written by His Highness the Prince himself. Are you suggesting that the Prince's ideas are vulgar and crude? Insulting the royal nobility can be punished by the severing of the tongue, do you still intend to stand by your opinion?" She looked towards the crowd behind Bella, "Or perhaps someone among you would like to try?"



Under her gaze, more than a dozen actors backed away.



"Enough!" Bella gritted her teeth, "Since you went to Border Town, you shouldn't have come back! You think I don't know, May! The reason you went to that broken place wasn't to see the idiot Eileen, but for Dawn—"



"Slap!"



Her voice stopped abruptly as a bright red handprint emerged on her left cheek. Bella touched her face in disbelief, "You... you dare to hit... hit..."



Sighing, May took a deep breath, realizing she had acted impulsively. This could bring her some trouble.



Sure enough, two male actors stepped forward from behind Bella. "Miss May, what you've done is a bit too much."



"Don't you know how important looks are to an actor? I think you at least owe her an apology."



Apologize? Wouldn't that mean admitting she was wrong? May sneered inwardly. Impulsive she might have been, but she didn't think she had anything to apologize for.



She glared at the two slick-looking men, recalling Carter Lannis's words.



"Men might be strong, but they have many weaknesses too. Their eyes, throat, and the area between their legs—if struck, can render them powerless in an instant. If you're agile and decisive, it's not impossible to take down a man much stronger than yourself."



She wasn't quite sure how she ended up discussing this with him, but she was ready to kick, just waiting for them to come a bit closer...



Just then, the door to the dressing room was violently pushed open. A knight clad in armor strode in, followed by several warriors carrying long spears. As they entered, they pointed their spear tips at the crowd.



"I hear someone here has slandered Prince Roland and harbors ill intentions towards His Highness's drama troupe?"



May could not help but freeze, blinking her eyes, thinking she was seeing an illusion. However, nothing changed, and she caught the smile that was secretly directed at her—the knight before her was none other than Carter Lannis.
