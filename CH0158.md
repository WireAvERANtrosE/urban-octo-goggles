## Ashes (Part 2)
"The most elite warriors of the Church, they are also the secret weapon against extraordinary witches," Ashes said, "They have strength and speed not inferior to mine, and..." She hesitated, "It seems they have no consciousness. When I fought with one of the God's Punishment Army, I cut off his right hand, but he immediately tried to gouge out my eyes with his left, and even when I turned to run, his actions were barely affected—this has nothing to do with willpower. Even the strongest person would struggle to maintain their fighting spirit after losing an arm, as the balance lost from an arm cannot be adapted to quickly."



"I have only heard of the Church's Judgement Army," Wendy murmured, "If they have such powerful warriors, why have they never appeared during the witch hunts?"



"I don't know," Ashes said slowly, "Even the name God's Punishment Army, I only learned after I returned to the old Holy City and heard it from some people."



"You... went back?" Wendy asked in surprise.



"Mhm, how could I easily let go of those scum," she stood up and walked to the window, "Later, I attacked several small churches and a Judgement Army outpost. There happened to be a Bishop there, and I thought they really were fearless of death." In the face of death and torturous pain, the other side didn’t fare much better than commoners, showing signs of fear, and even begging for mercy. "From his mouth, I learned the name God's Punishment Army. They are all Judgement Army soldiers transformed through a ceremony, and only the finest warriors can receive this honor. The transformation must be voluntary, and it seems the success rate is greatly related to whether the will is firm. In other words, the God's Punishment Army is different from witches, they are not naturally formed or because of special talents, but artificially transformed."



"..." Wendy was so shocked by the news that she couldn't speak.



"I guess they can't deploy the God's Punishment Army in combat like they use the Judgement Army, perhaps because of the side effects of the transformation. A warrior who has lost their consciousness, in a sense, is no different from a monster." Ashes sighed, "During that time, I hid in sewers or deep wells during the day and attacked church followers at night, until the Church launched a city-wide search, and I was forced to withdraw from the old Holy City. The day I left, the blood staining my clothes and skin stuck together, making me look ferocious. Perhaps in the eyes of others, I too was a beast that had lost its mind."



She felt a hand on her shoulder, "It's okay now, here you can live like a normal person, His Highness the Prince is very kind to the sisters. After going through the Evil Months and Duke Ryan's attack, most of the townspeople have also accepted the existence of witches. This town is the holy mountain we were searching for."



Ashes looked at the woman leaning beside her against the window sill. In her memory, the children living in the convent were all thin and frail, with dim eyes that showed no brightness. It was hard to imagine Wendy's childhood appearance now, whether in physique or looks, she was very different from the children of that time, and the natural tenderness in her tone also brought her a sense of peace and tranquility.



However, there were some things she had to say, "I will not stay here, nor did I come for this." She paused, "I want to take all of you with me, to a truly safe place. Border Town is not a place to stay for long."

"You won't stay here..." Wendy was stunned for a moment, "Why?"

"As long as one lives on this continent, they will always be threatened by the Church. Tilly has already gathered most of the witches of the Kingdom of Greycastle and is heading to the Fjords, planning to build a nation for witches there."

"But aren't there also churches in the Fjords?"

"Because of the special geography of the archipelago, the islands are separated from each other, and their influence can only be maintained within a small area. And..." Ashes lifted the corner of her mouth, "there is no God's Punishment Army on the islands."

It was time to let them witness the thunderous wrath of witches. One island after another, uprooting the Church's power, just as they eradicated witches.

"You and your sisters must leave, Wendy," she continued to persuade, "Spreading rumors to recruit companions is a mistake. I can hear this news, and so can the Church. They will never allow a witch organization to expand its scale at will. I think it won't be long before the Church's army will march across Greycastle to exterminate you. Faced with the invincible God's Punishment Army, do you think the Fourth Prince will still protect you? No secular lord will be willing to share life and death with witches. Right now, he may treat you well, but when the moment of crisis comes, he will abandon you without hesitation."

Wendy was silent for a while before saying, "I don't know what the other sisters think, but I will not leave Border Town."

"This place is already on the edge of a cliff," Ashes frowned, "The longer you stay, the greater the danger."



"If we abandon His Highness the Prince and leave the town just to avoid the danger that's about to come, how is that any different from him abandoning us? I don't want to be that kind of person, and..." she took a deep breath, "I don't think His Highness would succumb to the church's pressure as you've said. Nightingale once asked him the same question, and His Highness's answer was that he would spare no effort to allow every witch in his territory to live like a normal person, even if it means making enemies with the church."

"..." Ashes didn't respond. She didn't know what to say for a moment. She had seen too many broken promises, and even if he was willing to shelter the witches to the end, what was the point? It would only lead to more sacrifices in the face of overwhelming power.

However, she had now gained a clear understanding of the Witch Cooperation Association's situation. After the death of the Serpent Witch Cara, the remaining members had been essentially taken in by the Lord of Border Town. Tassa, who had gone to spread the word in Silver City, probably wasn't just a civilian who happened to rescue a witch but a personal guard of the lord. Although she didn't know what cunning means he had used to gain the witches' trust, she was sure that his carefully constructed facade would quickly crumble under the threat of her great sword.

"I would like to have a talk with your lord, Roland Wimbledon," Ashes finally said in a deep voice.

...

She met the fourth Prince His Highness the next morning.

Ashes was led into the office by Nightingale and once again saw the disagreeable man.

Although she didn't want to admit it, he indeed shared the same bloodline as Tilly. His gray hair, simply tied back with a hairband, emitted specks of silver light in the morning sun, a symbol of the Greycastle royal family. His eyebrows and nose also bore some resemblance to Tilly, but the more similar they were, the more she disliked him. Unlike the usual attire she had seen at the court, his dressing was unusually clean, with no ornaments—no earrings, necklaces, rings, or bracelets. He sat simply in his chair, giving off a sense of looking down upon her.

The aura of a superior.



She couldn't help but think this to herself.

Well, judging by the looks, there indeed has been some improvement, Ashes thought coldly in her heart, wondering how long you can maintain this facade.

"Welcome, I heard your name is Ashes?" The other party took the initiative to speak, "You are the messenger sent by my sister, right?"

"No, I decided to come to Border Town on my own."

"But you are a messenger, aren't you?"

"..." Ashes frowned, what was the significance of emphasizing the word 'messenger'? She didn't want to get entangled in trivial matters, "Suppose so."

"Very well, Messenger Ashes," he revealed an ambiguous smile, "I heard you want to take away my witch?"
