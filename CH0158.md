## Ashes (Part 2)
"The most elite warriors of the Church, they are also the secret weapons used against the extraordinary witches," Ashes said. "They possess strength and speed not inferior to mine, and..." She hesitated, "it seems they lack any sense of consciousness. In a confrontation, I severed a God's Punishment Army warrior's right hand, yet without any hesitation, he used his left hand to gouge at my eyes. Even when I turned to flee, his actions were hardly affected—this has nothing to do with willpower. No matter how tenacious a person is, they can't adapt to losing the balance of an arm in a short period of time."



"I've only heard of the Church's Judgement Army," Wendy murmured. "If they have such powerful warriors, why haven't they appeared during the previous witch hunts?"



"I don't know," Ashes said slowly. "Even the name God's Punishment Army was something I only learned after returning to the old Holy City and inquiring among some people."



"You... went back?" Wendy exclaimed in surprise.



"Mhm, how could I easily let those scumbags off," she stood up and walked to the window. "Later, I attacked several small churches and a Judgement Army outpost. There happened to be an Archbishop there, and I thought they really weren't afraid of death." In the face of death and torment, the other side did not show much more bravery than ordinary people; they too showed fear and would beg for mercy. "From his mouth, I learned the name of the God's Punishment Army. They are all transformed from the Judgement Army through a ritual. Only the most excellent warriors can receive this honor, and the transformation must be voluntary, seemingly with a high correlation with the strength of will. In other words, unlike witches, the God's Punishment Army is not formed naturally or due to special talents; they are artificially altered."



Wendy was too shocked by the news to speak.



"I guess they can't deploy the God's Punishment Army in combat like they would use the Judgement Army, perhaps because of the side effects of the transformation. Warriors who have lost their consciousness, in a sense, are no different from monsters." Ashes sighed, "During that time, I hid in sewers or deep wells during the day and attacked the Church's believers at night, until the Church started a city-wide search, and I was forced to retreat from the old Holy City. The day I left, the blood that stained me clung to my clothes and skin, making my appearance fierce. In the eyes of outsiders, I too was a beast that had lost its consciousness."



She felt a hand on her shoulder, "It's alright now. You can live here as a normal person. His Highness treats all the sisters well. After going through the Evil Months and Duke Stronghold's attack together, most of the townspeople have also accepted the existence of witches. This town is the Holy Mountain we once sought."



Ashes looked at the woman leaning beside her on the windowsill. She remembered that the children in the monastery were all thin and frail, with dull eyes that lacked luster. It was hard to imagine Wendy as she looked during her childhood. Whether it was her figure or her appearance, she was very different from the children of that period. Moreover, the natural tenderness in her tone brought peace and tranquility to her.



However, there were some things she had to say, "I will not stay here, nor did I come for this reason." She paused, "I want to take you all away, to a place that is truly safe. Border Town is not a place to stay for long."



"You won't stay here..." Wendy was stunned for a moment, "Why?"



"As long as we live on this continent, we will always be threatened by the Church. Tilly has already gathered most of the witches of the Kingdom of Greycastle and has gone to the Fjords, intending to build a nation for witches there."



"But aren't there Church forces in the Fjords as well?"



"Due to the unique geography of the archipelago, the islands are separated from each other, and their influence can only be maintained within a very small area. And..." Ashes curled her lips into a smirk, "there are no God's Punishment Army on the islands."



It was time for them to witness the thunderous wrath of the witches. Island by island, they would uproot the Church's influence, just as they had purged witches.



"You and your sisters must leave, Wendy," she continued to persuade, "Spreading rumors to recruit companions is a mistake. If I can hear these messages, so can the Church. They will never allow a witch organization to expand its scale at will. I think it won't be long before the Church's army crosses Greycastle to exterminate you. Faced with the invincible God's Punishment Army, do you think the Fourth Prince will protect you? No secular lord will be willing to share life and death with witches. He might be good to you now, but in times of crisis, he will abandon you without hesitation."



Wendy was silent for a while before she spoke, "I don't know what the other sisters will think, but I will not leave Border Town."



"This place is already on the edge of a cliff," Ashes frowned, "Every day we stay, we are in more danger."



"If we abandon Prince Roland and leave the town just to avoid the impending danger, how would that be any different from him abandoning us? I do not wish to become that kind of person, and..." she took a deep breath, "I do not believe that His Highness would yield to the church's pressure as you suggest. Nightingale once asked him the same question, and the prince's answer was that he would spare no effort to allow every witch in his territory to live as normal people, even if it means becoming an enemy of the Church."



...



Ashes did not respond. She did not know what to say for a moment. She had seen too many instances of promises being broken, and even if the other party was willing to shelter witches to the end, what significance would it have? Against overwhelming power, it would only lead to more sacrifices.



Nevertheless, she had now gained a clear understanding of the Witch Union's situation. After the Snake Witch Cara's death, the remaining members of the Union had essentially been taken in by the lord of Border Town. Theo, who had gone to Silver City to spread the news, was probably not just a civilian who happened to rescue witches, but rather the lord's personal guard. Although she did not know what cunning methods he used to gain the witches' trust, under the threat of her greatsword, his carefully constructed façade would soon crumble.



"I would like to speak with your lord, Roland Wimbledon," Ashes finally said in a heavy tone.



...



Ashes met with the Fourth Prince the following morning.



Nightingale led her into the office, where she once again saw the detestable man.



As much as she did not want to admit it, he indeed shared the same bloodline as Tilly. His gray hair, simply tied at the back with a hairband, emitted specks of silver light in the morning sun, a symbol of the royal family of Greycastle. His brows and nose also bore some resemblance to Tilly, but the more similar they looked, the more it displeased her. Different from the appearance he usually had in court, his attire was exceptionally clean, without any ornaments—no earrings, necklaces, rings, or bracelets. He sat in his chair with simplicity, yet he exuded a feeling of looking down upon her.



The aura of a superior.



The thought involuntarily popped into her head.

Well, judging by appearances alone, there indeed has been some improvement, Ashes thought to herself with a silent sneer, wondering how long you can keep up this facade.

"Welcome, I hear your name is Ashes?" The other party took the initiative to speak, "You are the envoy sent by my sister, aren't you?"

"No, I decided to come to Border Town on my own."

"But you are an envoy, aren't you?"

"..." Ashes frowned slightly, what was the importance of stressing the word 'envoy'? She didn't want to get entangled in trivial matters, "Suppose so."

"Very well, Envoy Ashes," he revealed an ambiguous smile, "I hear you want to take away my witch?"
