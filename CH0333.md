## The Defense Battle of the New City Wall
As the bell rang, the entire camp seemed to boil over with activity.

Vanner rushed out of his tent, quickly following the crowd to the top of the wall and into his combat position. This entire process had been rehearsed countless times, and even without someone directing, everyone knew what they had to do next.

Just like the previous Evil Months, only a few patrol teams were arranged on each section of the wall during the heightened alert state, and the scattered demonic beasts could be dealt with by two or three people. The alarm would only sound if the watchtower spotted a large-scale demonic beast attack.

A dark shadow was approaching on the horizon, and Vanner roughly estimated the number of enemies to be about a thousand or so—had this been a year ago, what followed would definitely have been a grueling battle. As a spearman responsible for buying time for the musket team to reload, he had to alternate with the reserve troops to last until the end.

But now, the town's strength had undergone an earth-shattering change.

Cat's Paw lifted the cannon cover, shaking off the snow, and Rodney checked the field cannon's barrel to ensure there were no foreign objects before beginning to load the ammunition. The walls had been rebuilt with earth, but their height and width had both increased, and there was a cannon platform every hundred meters, significantly enhancing the defensive firepower.

The passageway was wide enough for four people to walk abreast, with the first row during the battle being musketeers and the second row being new recruits who acted as loaders, responsible for filling the cartridges and passing them to the soldiers in front.

"Don't they ever get tired of it?" Rodney yawned. "Every Evil Months they rush over here like mad, even if they break into the town, it doesn't do them any good, does it?"

"It's good practice for us," Nelson laughed. "Beating demonic beasts is more interesting than shooting at stationary wooden targets, after all."



"Speaking of shooting, I recently heard an interesting rumor related to our artillery battalion," said Peel with a mysterious look on his face.

"What rumor?"

"I heard from the other cannon crews that those who are accurate shooters will be selected for an elite artillery team to take on a brand-new mission," he paused, "Does anyone know more about this?"

"Elite artillery team?"

"Even you, who claims to be well-informed, don't know, how could we possibly know more?"

"Maybe it's just someone who was bored and made it up."

Only Van'er remained silent upon hearing Peel's words. He frowned, surprised that someone was bragging about this matter.

Iron Axe had approached him a week ago and told him that His Highness the Prince planned to develop a new type of cannon, completely different from the field guns currently in use, which would not be handed over to the First Army. Instead, it would be mounted on ships to create vessels capable of long-range attacks. The operators for the new cannons would be selected from the best members of the artillery battalion, and anyone interested in joining could apply to Iron Axe.

Van'er had, of course, agreed without hesitation, seeing it as an opportunity to advance further in the military. According to Iron Axe, the Prince had high hopes for this new branch of the military, which might even become a completely new army separate from the First Army. If one were to make significant contributions, future newly-built warships might even be named after those with outstanding merits.



What an honor it would be! If there were a warship named after him, the Fanner, he would be satisfied for life. Looking back, he started as a mere laborer in a mine, always thinking himself above his station, but in the end, in the slums of the fortress, he couldn't even save his own brother's life. Now, he no longer needed to boast—his army was well-fed and warmly clothed; even when he returned to his neighborhood, the neighbors could call out his name.



All this change was brought by His Highness.



Thinking back, his decision to join the militia for an egg was indeed the wisest choice of his life.



Moreover, Iron Axe had also asked him if he had any suitable candidates to recommend, who could then apply as well. In other words, these young lads all had the chance to stand out, but they were too frivolous, better wait until they were more stable. And if they were to achieve great merit, would the warships then be named the Peeling or the Claw? That would be too ugly... Rodney or Nelson might be worth considering, though.



As for the matter of someone not being able to resist revealing this information to his subordinates, he still needed to report and explain to Iron Axe. After all, it was made very clear in the regulations class that any news of the First Army must not be spread without explicit orders from a superior.



"Stop the chatter and focus on the battlefield," Fanner coughed twice, interrupting the gun crew's discussion, "Don't forget what Lord Iron Axe emphasized over and over in class, that any mistake could lead to irreparable failure."



"Yes!" they all replied in unison.



Due to the low efficiency of the solid iron balls, they would wait for the demonic beasts to get close and then use buckshot. When the ferocious wolves crossed the one hundred meter line first, the bombardment began.



The heat wave swept up the snow beneath the muzzle, and the huge roar made Fanner's ears ring with pain. A cloud of black blood mist suddenly rose in the distance, and the demonic beasts fell in droves. Neither the wild boars nor the bear beasts had fur capable of withstanding the close-range impact of the iron pellets.



"There's a big one over there," Cat's Claw pointed towards the front left, "A Redskin Wolf!"

A group of people swiftly moved the cannon cart, adjusted the muzzle towards the target direction, and reloaded for firing—Theoretically, there was no need to aim with buckshot; as long as they fired towards the front, they could always take down a swath of enemies. Moreover, the newly built mud walls were higher than the stone walls, making it impossible for the demonic beasts to threaten the top of the wall. Prioritizing such agile evil beasts was merely for target practice purposes.

Next, it was finally the turn of the long-awaiting gunner squad; to ensure accuracy, they always waited to shoot until the target was about fifty meters away.

The sound of the revolving rifles was not as unified as that of the flintlock guns, but rather dense and continuous. Puffs of white smoke rose from the battlements, and the pungent smell of gunpowder came drifting over, making him sneeze uncontrollably.

"These idiots, despite their low power, produce more smoke than anyone when they shoot," complained Pine.

"But in the end, it's the artillery that determines the outcome of the battle," Rodney agreed, "It's true against knights, and it should be the same against evil beasts."

Just then, the urgent ringing of the bell from the lookout post signaled the warning of a mixed breed evil beast sighting.

Van'er narrowed his eyes, looking ahead, only to see two massive dark silhouettes slowly advancing through the smoke. Judging by their size, they should be Siege Beasts with thick armored shells.

"What were you saying just now?" he grinned, "Now it's our time to shine. Switch to the pointed solid shot."



To deal with enemies with higher defense, the Arsenal developed a new type of shell that could penetrate the enemy's shell at about two hundred meters. If attacking the demonic beast wolves was just a warm-up, now it was time for the real shooting.

"Do a good job," Vanner clapped his hands and said, "Let the other gun crews see who the most elite artillerymen are."
