## From the Mist
The person who replaced the previous one only managed to catch two of Brian's swords before his weapon was directly knocked away.

Rather than saying they were also members of the patrol team, it would be more accurate to say that they were just a bunch of thugs, Brian angrily thought. Apart from extortion and blackmail, what had these people ever done? He and Greyhound had been meticulously carrying out the tasks entrusted by the lord, yet they had become the odd ones out in the team.

But... it was precisely these worthless scum, these degenerates who, in order to curry favor with the stronghold, did not hesitate to bring disaster upon the town, who had killed Greyhound, using the most despicable means.

Unforgivable!

He swung his sword at the neck of his opponent, who wore a face of terror—

Just at that moment, a dark shadow lunged from beneath the target, closing in on Brian's heart in the blink of an eye. The strike was too covert; by the time he noticed, it was already too late to block.

In a moment of desperation, he forcefully stamped on the ground, propelling his body backward as a sharp pain shot through his chest.

After rolling twice and quickly getting to his feet, Brian immediately took up a defensive stance. The sneak attack had only pierced through his coat and skin; fortunately, it was not serious. The critical point was the person who had made the strike! He did not remember anyone in the patrol team having such swordsmanship.

"Huh? You actually dodged it." The man pushed his disarmed comrade aside and walked forward step by step.



By the light of the fire, Brian found that he did not recognize the man at all—his stature was not tall, yet his arms were excessively long, almost reaching his knees when hanging down. His face was also unfamiliar, and Brian swore he had never seen this man before.

"You're not from the patrol...who the hell are you?"

Although he did not interact much with the five men next door, he could still recognize them. The guy before him had clearly taken the place of one of them and had blended into the team to infiltrate the castle. It was not surprising that he had not noticed during the midnight journey, but Scarface and the others could not have possibly missed it. Since they were not surprised by it, there was only one explanation: this guy was deliberately brought in by Scarface.

"You've already guessed the answer, so why bother asking me?" He smiled indifferently. "After all, you're going to die soon."

"Damn it, he's wounded me!" Scarface cursed bitterly. "Snake, chop off his limbs, I want to drain his blood slowly!"

"Unfortunately, Mr. Hill, I must prioritize completing the task given by Lord Count first."

Before his words had finished, the man known as Snake lunged forward. His attacks were from tricky angles and with his excessively long reach, Brian was immediately put on the defensive, forced to retreat continuously without a chance to counterattack.

He had been careless! Brian felt a surge of anxiety. He had been fighting in the underground passage for so long, surely the people above must have noticed by now?

He had intended to personally avenge Grayhound, but now he could only hope to hold out a little longer, waiting for His Highness's Royal Guards to come and surround these villains.



"You seem to be expecting something," Snake suddenly paused his attack and said, "I guess you're waiting for the prince's men to come save you? Unfortunately, this stone-built castle is different from the taverns and inns you are used to. Those buildings made of wooden frames will creak all over when people are indulging in pleasures. Here, as long as the door is closed, even if you scream your throat hoarse, no sound will be heard above."



Brian was taken aback by the remark, which was exactly what Snake had been waiting for. While maintaining a posture of holding his sword downward to numb his opponent, Snake slightly raised his other hand, triggering the trigger of the hand crossbow hidden in his sleeve.



A crossbow bolt only the length of an index finger shot out from the cuff, and Brian only heard the light hum of the bowstring before the arrow had buried itself in his lung.



An unbearable sharp pain exploded in his chest, and Brian threw his longsword at the rapidly approaching Snake and turned to run away. But the blood seeping from his lungs quickly filled his airway, making it difficult to breathe. He didn't get far before he tripped over the threshold and stumbled heavily to the ground.



Snake quickly caught up, intending to finish off his opponent, but was blocked by Scarface.



"Let me do it," he said through gritted teeth, "I want this guy to know what happens when he wounds me!"



A cold glint flashed across Snake's face, but he eventually stepped aside, "Make it quick, and don't forget our main business."



Scarface grabbed Brian's hair and growled at him, "Believe me, you're going to die in agony."



Brian really wanted to spit a mouthful of blood in the other's face, but his strength was draining away like water, and he knew he didn't have long to live. Regrets from the past flooded his mind, such as the wife he had yet to meet, and the unfulfilled dream of becoming a knight. But the greatest regret was... not being able to avenge Grayhound.



Wait, what is that?

He blinked, and on the box in front of him sat a woman. Although her appearance was not clear under the dim light, her exquisite figure left no doubt that she was a woman.

Damn, is this an illusion...? When he crashed into this room, he had not seen anyone inside. Could it be that the gods above had heard his complaints and specially created an illusion to comfort him?

"Hey, you're making quite the commotion on someone else's turf, and you plan to kill someone right in front of me, that doesn't seem quite proper, does it?"

Bryant only felt Scarface's hand tremble, suddenly releasing his hair. The sound of weapons being drawn echoed around, several fierce shouts rang out simultaneously, "Who are you!?"

Their reaction is too much... Wait, Brian thought hazily, could it be that what he saw wasn't an illusion?

"Of course, I belong here." The woman jumped down from the barrel, bending over to pat the dust off her robe. In the dim firelight, Brian saw an unusual pattern embroidered on her robe—three triangles arranged side by side and a large eye embedded in the center. The outline of the eye reflected flecks of gold in the light of the fire.

"And you? Rats that snuck in from the gutter?" Her voice was crisp and pleasing, yet devoid of any emotion. This was not normal... Any person witnessing a scene of murder should not be so calm.

Snake also realized this and with a solemn expression, he slowly moved to her side and suddenly thrust his sword at her.



The woman didn't even turn her head, she casually waved her hand, and the venomous snake didn't even see her weapon, only feeling a cold breeze brushing past his body.

With a scream, Scarface stared in disbelief, as he saw the venomous snake rush forward and quickly retreat, where once was the hand that held the sword, now there was nothing.

His arm, along with the sword, fell to the ground.

Fear instantly seized Scarface's throat. Others might not know, but he was very clear about the venomous snake's background. "Ruthless, cunning, and dangerous," was the Earl's assessment of him. Anyone who caught the eye of the Earl and was recruited by him was definitely not to be underestimated; even Brian couldn't last half a minute under his assault. But now, he was casually disarmed by a woman, severing his entire arm with a single strike.

"What are you dawdling for, go and kill her!" the venomous snake shouted as he clutched his wound.

Brian, losing too much blood, began to have a blurry vision. He heard footsteps all around him, the clashing of weapons, and... the dull thud of bodies hitting the ground. What exactly was happening? He struggled to move his eyeballs, looking forward—

And then the patrol captain saw a scene he couldn't comprehend.

The woman's figure was like a ghost, she walked among the encirclement of people, appearing and disappearing intermittently. With each strike, she pierced through the enemy's vitals. It was less of a fight and more of a dance; he had never seen anyone wield a weapon so rhythmically lethal, her sword danced up and down, tracing unimaginable trajectories. Compared to her, the others were just a bunch of clumsy clowns. They futilely fought back, and just as futilely fell... In the end, only she stood proudly alone in the center.

That was also the last scene Brian saw before he lost consciousness.
