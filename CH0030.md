## From the Fog
The man who replaced Brian could barely parry two of his strikes before his weapon was directly knocked away. Rather than calling them members of the patrol team, it would be more accurate to say they were just a bunch of hooligans, Brian thought angrily. What else have these people done besides extortion and blackmail? He and Greyhound were meticulously carrying out the tasks assigned by their lord, yet they were the odd ones out in the team. But it was these worthless trash, these scum who had killed Greyhound by resorting to the most despicable means in order to ingratiate themselves with the stronghold, even if it meant wreaking havoc in the town. Unforgivable! He swung his sword towards the terrified opponent's neck—Just then, a dark shadow stabbed out from the target. In the blink of an eye, it was approaching Brian's heart. The strike was too covert; it was too late for him to block when he noticed it. Out of desperation, he pushed hard against the ground, his body bounced backward, and a sharp pain came from his chest. After rolling twice, Brian sprang to his feet and immediately took a defensive position. The sneak attack had only pierced his coat and skin, thankfully, it was not serious. The key was the person who had made that stab! He didn't remember anyone in the patrol team having such swordsmanship. "Eh? You actually dodged it." The man pushed away his weaponless teammate and slowly walked forward.

By the firelight, Brian found himself completely unfamiliar with the other party—his stature was not tall, but his hands were overly long, almost hanging down to his knees when dropped. The face was also unfamiliar, Brian swore he had never seen this face before. 
"You're not from the patrol... Who exactly are you?" 
Although he didn't interact much with the five guys next door, he could recognize people. The guy in front of him had obviously replaced one of them and snuck into the castle with the team. It was not surprising that he didn't notice him during the night march, but Scar and the others could not possibly have overlooked him. Since they were not surprised at all, there was only one explanation, this guy was specifically arranged by Scar. 
"You've already guessed the answer, why bother asking me?" He laughed indifferently, "After all, you're about to die." 
"Damn it, he hurt me!" Scar grumbled, "Viper, quickly chop off his hands and feet, I want to drain his blood slowly!" 
"Unfortunately, Mr. Hills, I must prioritize the task given by the Count." 
As soon as he finished speaking, the man known as Viper rushed up. His angle of attack was tricky and strange, coupled with his extremely long arm span, Brian was caught in a tough battle for a while, being forced to retreat continuously, without any chance to counterattack. 
He was careless! Brian was a bit anxious in his heart, after fighting for so long in the underground passage, shouldn't the people above have noticed by now? 
He had originally planned to avenge Greyhound himself, but now he only hoped to hold on a bit longer, waiting for His Highness’s personal guard knights to come and wipe out these villains.

"You seem to be expecting something," the Viper suddenly paused his attack, "I guess you're waiting for the prince to come to save you? Unfortunately, this stone castle is different from the taverns and inns you're used to. Those wooden shacks, when people are reveling, the whole floor will creak. Here, as long as the door is closed, even if you shout till your throat breaks, no one above will hear anything."

Brian was taken aback by the Viper's accuracy in reading his thoughts, and that was the opportunity Viper was waiting for. He maintained his sword-down posture to numb his opponent, and his other hand slightly raised, triggering the crossbow hidden in his sleeve.

A crossbow arrow about the length of a finger shot out from the sleeve. Brian only heard a slight hum of the bowstring, and the arrow had already entered his lungs.

Unbearable severe pain immediately exploded in his chest. Brian threw his long sword at the charging Viper and turned to run. But the blood seeping from his lungs quickly filled his airway, making it difficult for him to breathe. He didn't get far before he tripped over the door threshold and fell heavily to the ground.

The Viper quickly caught up, intending to finish off his opponent, but was stopped by Ferocious Scar.

"Let me," he gritted his teeth, "I want this guy to know the consequences of hurting me!"

A flash of coldness crossed the Viper's face, but he eventually stepped aside, "Be quick, and don't forget our main task."

Ferocious Scar grabbed Brian's hair and growled at him, "Trust me, you're going to die painfully."

Brian wanted to spit blood in his face, but his strength was draining away like water. He knew he didn't have long to live. Past regrets flooded his mind, like an as yet unknown wife, and an unfulfilled dream of being a knight. But his biggest regret was... not being able to avenge Greyhound.

"Wait, what is that?"
He blinked, and there was a woman sitting on a crate in front of him. Although her features were indistinct in the dim light, her shapely figure left no doubt that she was a woman.
Damn, is this a hallucination...? He didn't see anyone when he stumbled into this room. Could it be that the gods in the heavens had heard his complaints and created this illusion to comfort him?
"Hey, you guys are making quite a ruckus on someone else's territory and planning to kill in front of me, isn't that inappropriate?" 
Bryant only felt a tremor in his scarred hand, and he abruptly let go of his own hair. Around him, the sounds of weapons being drawn echoed and several angry shouts rang out at the same time, "Who are you!?"
Their reaction was a bit... Wait, Bryant thought groggily, was what he was seeing not an illusion?
"Of course, I belong here." The woman jumped down from the barrel, bent over, and brushed off the dust on her robe. In the dim firelight, Bryant saw a peculiar pattern embroidered on her robe - three triangles arranged side by side, and a large eye set in the middle. The contour of the eye shone with flecks of gold under the firelight.
"And you? Are you rats who sneaked in from the gutter?" Her voice was clear and pleasant but devoid of any emotion. It was illogical... No one should be this calm upon witnessing a murder scene.
Snake also noticed this and his expression became serious. He slowly circled to the side of the woman and suddenly thrust his sword.

The woman didn't even turn her head, dismissing the danger with a casual wave of her hand. The Viper didn’t even see her weapon, he only felt a chilling wind sweep past his body. 

With a scream of horror, Scarface stared in disbelief. He watched as the Viper charged forward, only to quickly retreat, the place where he had held his sword now empty. His arm, along with his sword, had fallen to the ground.

Fear instantly choked Scarface. Others might not know, but he understood the Viper's strength all too well. "Ruthless and cunning," was how the Count had evaluated him. Anyone recruited by the Count was definitely not to be underestimated. Even Brian would have difficulty lasting half an hour under his attack. But now, he had been casually disarmed by a woman, his entire arm severed.

"What are you all standing around for, go kill her!" The Viper shouted, clutching his wound.

Brian, losing blood rapidly, found his vision blurring. He could hear the chaos of footsteps around him, the clash of weapons, and the thud of bodies falling. What was happening? He strained his eyes to look ahead—

And then the patrol captain saw something he couldn't comprehend. 

The woman moved like a ghost, appearing and disappearing amidst the crowd. Each strike was lethal, piercing vital points. It was less a fight and more a dance. He had never seen anyone wield a deadly weapon with such rhythm. Her sword danced in her hands, tracing an incredible path. In comparison, everyone else was just a clumsy clown. They retaliated in vain, and fell just as hopelessly... In the end, only she remained standing.

That was the last thing Brian saw before he lost consciousness.
