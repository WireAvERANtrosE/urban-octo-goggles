## Father and Son
The castle's dungeon was not as damp and dark as the prison in Border Town; it seemed the Duke did not want his basement to become a haunted house, or to be greeted by a disgusting stench upon descending the stairs. Overall, the dungeon was relatively clean. The cells varied in decoration; some were bare, while others were not only furnished with beds but also wardrobes, desks, and chandeliers. It seemed that the Duke had originally intended this place for detaining certain nobles, so basic amenities were ensured.

Roland even found a particularly special cell in a corner, with a large bed occupying half the room's area and chains hanging from the ceiling, though the cuffs attached to the chains were wrapped in sheepskin, and various whips hung on the walls. It appeared that Duke Ryan had his interests in certain areas, he thought; it was a pity that he would be leaving soon and wouldn't have time to ponder on this further.

As the most valuable captive, Sharif Hellmond was naturally kept in the best cell. If one ignored the iron bars around it, it looked more like a luxurious bedroom. Sharing the cell with him were the viscounts from the Maple Leaf and Running Wolf families, the eldest son of the Wild Rose family, and the second son of the Elk family. These families, together with the Lion of Ryan, made up the six great houses of the Longsong Stronghold—of course, Ryan's faction had already been dismantled by Roland, with his wife and children locked up next door.

Seeing Prince Roland appear in the dungeon, the nobles all stood up. Before they could speak, Roland addressed them first, "Count Hellmond, you may come out now. As for the others, once the ransoms are delivered, I will naturally release you."

"Father," Pello was relieved to see the count's rosy complexion; he glanced at his friends and then looked at Roland, "Your Highness, I did not see the name of the Earl of Elk on the list. If he died on the battlefield, their eldest son should still be in the capital, and their family lacks someone to take charge. Could we release Reynold Medde first to arrange his own ransom? I am willing to vouch for him."

"The eldest son of the Elk family, you mean York Medde?" Roland shook his head, "He has returned. Not only has he returned, but he also visited the castle yesterday. However... I don't think he intends to pay the ransom."

Hearing this, Reynold pressed himself incredulously against the bars, "Why?"

"He said that you failed to protect your father on the battlefield, that you are the executioner who killed Earl Medde."

"Why would he say such a thing? The one who killed my father was clearly—" Reynold suddenly closed his mouth.

Roland said nonchalantly, "You mean to say that it was I who killed the Earl, right?" He walked up to the cage, "Before the Evil Months, your father sent men to infiltrate my castle, trying to burn the provisions. Now, he has followed the Duke and led a large group of knights to attack my territory. All I did was retaliate and repel the invaders. So, am I the murderer? Compared to the instigator, Duke Ryan, and his accomplice, Earl Mayne, who should be more condemned? Moreover, if it weren't for Hill's testimony indicating you knew nothing about the burning of the provisions, you would have been dead by now."
"..." Rayne was at a loss for words.
"Your Highness," Petro asked anxiously, "if no one is willing to pay the ransom, will you execute him?"
"I wouldn't do that. I am always merciful," Roland smirked, "I'll probably just take him back to Border Town and have him work in the North Slope mine for twenty years to atone for his sin."
"How much... is the ransom?"
"As a second son, he has no chance of inheriting the title, so naturally, his price is not as high as Earl Silverflame's. Just a thousand units of supplies will suffice." Roland looked at him with interest, "Why, are you thinking of paying the ransom for him?"
"What unit, a thousand Gold royals?" the Earl, released by the guards, interjected.
"Your son will tell you," the prince gestured, "Let's go, there's nothing for you here. As for the matter of the second son of the Mayne family, there's no need to rush. You can take your time to consider it on the way back."
The group left the dungeon and reached the castle gate when the Earl suddenly stopped, "Your Highness, I know that Duke Ryan's actions are unforgivable, but... his wife and son are innocent."

"Perhaps," Roland said unequivocally, "I never planned to sentence them to exile or hanging. I'll just take them back to Border Town and imprison them there." Until the day I ascend to the throne, he thought. Now was not the time for misplaced mercy. Releasing them without charges would do nothing but further muddle the waters of Longsong Stronghold—the eldest son has the legal right of inheritance.
...
"What did you say!?" Shalla Hermon's eyes widened in disbelief as she stared at Petrov, "His Highness doesn't plan to reside in Longsong Stronghold, and he's going to leave you in charge of the city?"
Back at the Earl of Silverflower's residence, Petrov immediately recounted in detail everything that had happened over the past three days. When the subject of the proxy contract came up, the Earl could no longer contain himself. After receiving a confirmation from his son, he stood up and paced around the study, his emotions clearly complex.
"Father, are you alright?" Petrov asked with concern.
"It looks like our main opponents are outside the Elk family. Apart from them, the other three families, whether in terms of foundation or strength, are all inferior to us."
"What?" He was momentarily confused.
"Opponents, opponents!" the Earl exclaimed, "You disappoint me so much. His Highness has given you such a great opportunity, and you still haven't figured out who your opponents are?"
"Eh, aren't you surprised?"

"It's strange why His Highness the Prince insists on returning to Border Town. Of course, it's strange," the Earl stroked his beard, "but what does that have to do with us, as long as this contract is genuine."

That's true, thought Petro. His Highness wouldn't go through all this trouble just to amuse himself. As for his reasons for favoring Border Town, those could be pondered later. But he hadn't expected his father to be so accepting of the situation.

"Have you heard that the Mead boy is your friend?" Sir Shalafi suddenly stopped and said, "Get him out tomorrow."

"You agree to spend a thousand gold royals to redeem him?" Petro was taken aback.

"Think about it. Earl Elk died, and his eldest son is not willing to redeem his younger brother. In this battle, aside from a few knights, there are virtually no losses. Once Jack Mead inherits the title, he will certainly hinder you from... no, from managing the Longsong Stronghold," the Earl explained. "Why doesn't Jack want to redeem Reyn? Because he's afraid Reyn will threaten him."

Alright, so that was the reason, Petro thought with a bitter smile. But he knew his father was right. Reyn had always loved longswords and lances since he was young, and he was very close to the knights of the territory. Unlike the eldest son Jack, who thought physical combat was beneath the dignity of nobility, preferring the romantic pursuits of the capital. Even though Reyn repeatedly showed that he wanted to be a knight, that was when he had no inheritance rights. Now, without the Earl's constraints, who knew if he would gather his knights and simply eliminate his older brother? Jack's decision to not pay to redeem someone who made him uneasy was very decisive and ruthless.

"My friend would not do such a thing," he said confidently.

"Perhaps, but after you redeem him, whether or not he has planned to do so, Jack will be very troubled," Sir Shalafi continued, "As for the thousand gold royals' worth of goods, we can choose craftsmen with higher values."

"When preparing your ransom, I have already transferred some craftsmen. If we add more, there won't be enough left for the territory."

"Don't worry, do you know that the Northern Region is now in chaos?" the Earl confidently said, "The allied forces of the four major kingdoms have all been annihilated at Hermes, and the lords are forcibly conscripting the people into their armies, resulting in a large number of refugees. We can take this opportunity to take a bigger bite, and in the future, we'll even save on the materials that we have to hand over every month."

It was then that Pero realized that his father was also a master of commerce—at least much more adept at it than he was on the battlefield.
