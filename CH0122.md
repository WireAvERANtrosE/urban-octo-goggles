## Father and Son
The castle's dungeon was not as damp and dark as the prison in Border Town, perhaps the Duke did not want his basement to become a haunted house, or to be greeted with a disgusting stench as soon as one walked down the stairs. Overall, the dungeon was relatively clean. Different cells had different levels of decoration; some were empty, while others not only had beds, but also wardrobes, desks, and chandeliers. It seemed that the Duke had originally intended this place for the imprisonment of certain nobles, so basic civility was still ensured.



Roland found a particularly special cell in the corner, where a large bed took up half of the room's area. Chains hung from the ceiling, but the iron cuffs at the end were wrapped in sheepskin, with various styles of whips hanging on the wall. It seemed that the Duke of Lion had explored certain areas of study, he thought, it's a pity that he would have to leave here in a few days and would not have time to ponder it further.



Count Shalafi Helmann, as the most valuable captive, was naturally kept in the best cell. If one ignored the iron bars outside, it would seem like a luxurious bedroom. Sharing the cell with him were viscounts from the Maple Leaf and Wild Wolf families, the eldest son of the Wild Rose family, and the second son of the Moose family. These families, together with the Lion of Longsong Stronghold, formed the six major houses—of course, Lion's side had already been dissolved by Roland, with his wife and son locked up next door.



Upon seeing Prince Roland appear in the dungeon, the nobles stood up one after another. Before they could ask any questions, Roland spoke first, "Count Helmann, you may come out now. As for the others, when the ransom arrives, I will naturally let you go."



"Father," Peter, relieved to see the Count's ruddy complexion, glanced at his friends and then looked at Roland, "Your Highness, I didn't see the name of the Count of the Moose family on the list. If he died on the battlefield, their eldest son should still be in the capital, and there is no one at home who can take charge. Can we let Rene Mead out first so he can go back and arrange the ransom himself? I am willing to vouch for him."



"The eldest son of the Moose family, you mean Jack Mead?" Roland shook his head, "He has returned. Not only has he returned, but he also visited the castle yesterday. However... I don't think he intends to pay the ransom."



Hearing this, Rene incredulously pressed against the bars of the cage, "Why?"



"He said that you failed to protect your father on the battlefield, that you are the executioner who killed Count Mead."



"Why would he say such a thing, the one who killed father was clearly—" Rene suddenly closed his mouth.



Roland said nonchalantly, "You mean to say that it was me who killed the Earl, right?" He walked up to the cage. "Before the Evil Months, your father sent men to sneak into my castle, attempting to burn my grain stores. Now, he has followed the Duke and led a cavalry squadron to attack my territory. I merely retaliated and repelled the invaders. So, am I the murderer? Compared to the instigator, the Duke of Lion, and his accomplice, Earl Mead, who deserves more condemnation? Furthermore, if it weren't for Hils' testimony indicating your ignorance regarding the grain-burning incident, you would already be dead."



Rene was at a loss for words.



"Your Highness," Peter asked with concern, "if no one is willing to pay the ransom, will you execute him?"



"That I will not," Roland cracked a smile, "I am always merciful. Probably just take him back to Border Town and have him mine in the northern slopes for twenty years to atone for his sins."



"How much... is the ransom?"



"As a second son with no chance of inheriting the title, his price naturally cannot compare with Earl Honeysuckle. Just a thousand units of materials will suffice." Roland looked at him with interest. "Why, are you thinking of paying the ransom for him?"



"What unit, a thousand Gold royals?" the Earl, who had been released by the guards, interrupted.



"Your son will tell you," the prince gestured invitingly, "Let's go, there's nothing good to stay here for. As for the matter of Earl Mead's second son, there's no need for haste. You can take your time to think it over on your way back."



As the group left the dungeon and arrived at the castle gates, the Earl suddenly stopped, "Your Highness, I acknowledge that the Duke of Lion's actions are unforgivable, but... his wife and son are innocent."



"Perhaps," Roland said noncommittally, "I have no intention of sentencing them to exile or hanging, only to take them back to Border Town and imprison them there." Until the day I ascend to the throne, he thought. Now was not the time for womanly kindness; releasing them without charges would do nothing but further muddy the waters of Longsong Stronghold—the eldest son has a legal right to inherit.

...

"What did you say!?" Shalafi Helmann’s eyes widened in disbelief as he stared at Peter, "His Highness doesn't plan to stay in Longsong Stronghold, and he's even going to leave you in charge of the city?"

Upon returning to the Honeysuckle Earl's Mansion, Peter meticulously recounted everything that had happened over the past three days to his father. When the conversation turned to the acting contract, the Earl could no longer contain himself. After receiving a confirmation from his son, he stood up and started pacing around the study, visibly conflicted.

"Father, are you alright?" Peter asked with concern.

"It seems that our main opponents are the Moose family, apart from them, the other three families are both in terms of foundation and strength, not as good as us."

"What?" He was taken aback for a moment.

"Your opponents, your opponents!" the Earl exclaimed, "You have disappointed me so much. His Highness has given you such a great opportunity, and you still haven't figured out who your opponents are?"

"Uh, don't you find it strange?"



"It's strange why His Highness the Prince insists on returning to Border Town. Of course, it's strange," the Earl stroked his beard, "but what does that have to do with us? As long as this contract is real, that's all that matters."



That's true, Peter thought. His Highness would not go through all this trouble just to tease himself. As for his fondness for Border Town, he could think about that slowly. But he did not expect his father to be so accepting.



"Have you heard that the Mead kid is your friend?" Shalafi suddenly stopped and said, "Tomorrow, you go bail him out."



"You agree that I spend a thousand gold royals to redeem him?" Peter was taken aback.



"Think about it, with Earl Elk dead and his eldest son unwilling to redeem the second son, there were almost no losses in this fight except for a few knights. Once Jack Mead inherits the title, he will inevitably hinder your control... no, your stewardship of Longsong Stronghold," the Earl explained. "Why does Jack not want to redeem Rene? Because he fears the other poses a threat to himself."



Alright, it's for that reason, Peter thought to himself with a bitter smile. But he knew his father was right. Rene had always been fond of longswords and spears from a young age and was very close to the knights in the territory. Unlike the eldest son Jack, who thought physical combat was beneath the nobility's dignity and preferred the romantic lifestyle of the capital. Although Rene repeatedly showed that he was more interested in becoming a knight, that was when he had no right to inherit. Now without the Earl's constraints, who knew if he would gather his knights and simply get rid of the eldest son? To spend money to redeem someone who made himself uneasy, Jack's decision was very straightforward and ruthless.



"My friend wouldn't do that," he said firmly.



"Maybe, but after you redeem him, whether he plans to do it or not, Jack will have a big headache," Shalafi continued. "As for the thousand gold royals' worth of materials, we can choose craftsmen who are worth more."



"When I was preparing the ransom for you, I had already transferred some craftsmen. If we put in more, there won't be enough left for the territory."



"Don't worry, do you know that the Northern Territory is now in chaos?" The Earl confidently said, "The allied forces of the four major kingdoms have all been annihilated at Hermes, and the lords are forcibly conscripting the people to enlist, resulting in a large number of refugees. We can take this opportunity to swallow up more territory, and then we won't even have to pay the monthly tribute of supplies."



It was at this moment Peter realized that his father was also a master of commerce—certainly much more skilled than him on the battlefield.
