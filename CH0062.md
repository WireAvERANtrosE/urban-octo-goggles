## Oath
Today's events made Roland lose any desire to continue assembling the steam drill. For dinner, he specifically asked the chef to prepare an especially rich meal—unlimited servings of black pepper pork chops and fried eggs, which left Anna and Lightning with their bellies bulging. Nana tried her best to maintain her manners, but in the end, her little mouth was still chewing with a shiny gloss. In addition to the dining room portion, he also had the maids prepare insulated porcelain containers filled with tenderly stewed meat strips and wheat porridge to be sent to Nightingale's room. As long as they woke up, they would be able to eat warm food.



After dinner, the next task was to arrange the rooms. Thankfully, the previous lord of Border Town had been quite particular about appearances. A town born from mining and early warning, its castle was still built to the standards of a medium-sized town. In Roland's familiar terms, it was a standalone villa with a living area of nine hundred square meters, three stories high, including a mezzanine, with watchtowers and arrow towers at the four corners. It also came with a front courtyard and a backyard garden.



Roland arranged Lightning’s room opposite Anna's, and the room next door was intended for Wendy after her recovery. Seeing Nana sticking to Anna like glue as she entered the room, he couldn't help but shake his head with a smile.



Back in his office, Roland poured himself a glass of barley wine. Plans never keep up with changes; he originally thought that through Nightingale, he could recruit a large number of witches and light up all branches of the technology tree such as chemical, agricultural, and biological sciences. However, he did not expect the leaders of the Witch Cooperation Association to harbor such great hostility towards the noble class. Neutrals like Nightingale and Lightning were actually in the minority. As for Wendy... according to Lightning, she didn't actively want to leave the Witch Cooperation Association; she was only forced to bring her here after being attacked by the Witch Cooperation Association's founder, the Serpent Witch Cara, in an attempt to save Nightingale.



Two is still better than none, he thought as he drained the glass of wine in one gulp.



During the meal, he asked Lightning about her and Wendy's abilities and learned that the young girl could fly freely in the air like a bird, while Wendy could manipulate the power of wind. These abilities were not particularly useful for climbing the technological ladder, but if used wisely, they could still be very beneficial in the upcoming war.



He also casually inquired about the abilities of other witches in the camp and found that their abilities were diverse and without any pattern. Some effects could be barely explained with scientific theories, while others were completely beyond comprehension.



For example, the Witch Cooperation Association's founder, the Serpent Witch Cara, could condense magic into snake forms—these snakes were not illusions; they could be touched and could attack enemies. Different snake patterns represented different toxins, and from what Lightning had seen so far, there were at least paralytic and lethal effects.



However, Roland noticed that, whether it was Anna or Cara, the witches' magic mostly had effects only at close range. For instance, Anna’s green fire would suddenly disappear five meters away. Cara's poisonous snakes could not stray too far from her body. Nightingale and Lightning's abilities had an even shorter range of effect; to influence external objects, they had to make contact for their abilities to work.



So when they faced the church's army equipped with crossbows and God's Punishment Stones, they had no choice but to scatter and flee.

After working in the office until midnight, the light from the fireplace gradually dimmed. Roland sneezed and decided to go back to his room to sleep.

As he pushed open the bedroom door, he realized something was amiss—the scene before him seemed familiar. A woman sat at the head of his bed, half of her figure shrouded in darkness, with the firelight casting her silhouette on the wall like a painting. Yet there were many differences; she was not wearing the unchanging long robe but had changed into ordinary casual clothes. Her appearance was no longer the unfamiliar one he had seen at first sight; it was so familiar that he could identify her at a glance.

Nightingale.

Roland immediately became a bit nervous. This posture—could it be... was his luck about to turn?

Nightingale also saw the prince and got up, slowly walking over. Having rested for only half a day, her complexion was much better than when he first saw her, with rosy cheeks replacing the paleness, and her hair was no longer dull and lusterless. It had to be said, the self-healing ability of witches was indeed astonishing.

"You've worked hard," Roland coughed, breaking the silence, "Why not rest a bit longer? Lightning has already told me everything."

Nightingale shook her head.

Roland faintly felt that something was not right. Her expression was solemn, and there was an indescribable determination in her eyes. She had made up her mind, Roland realized, and this resolute look was rare to see even among men, making him put aside other emotions and focus on waiting for her next words.



However, Nightingale did not speak; she took a deep breath, then knelt on one knee, holding up a short sword with both hands, her head slightly bowed—this was a standard knightly salute, a gesture often performed by nobles when swearing fealty to their superiors.



"Prince Roland Wimbledon, in the names of Nightingale and Veronica, I swear to you," she said crisply, "as long as you treat witches well, I am willing to be at your disposal, whether as a steadfast shield against demons or a blade that cuts through the night, fearless and without regret, until the last moment of my life."



So that's how it is, Roland thought, the actions of the Witch Cooperation Association must have deeply disappointed her, hence she placed her hopes of leading the witches forward onto himself. As a transmigrator, he should have refused; he was more accustomed to hiring or cooperating in a joint effort, and if it went a step further, those with common ideals and ambitions would be comrades.



But he knew that sometimes emphasizing equality and freedom was pointless without suitable soil for growth, and even if seeds were sown, they would still decay. As a prince, he could not stray from his own class before unifying the entire kingdom.



Roland fell silent for a moment, then following the court's etiquette, took the short sword and lightly tapped her shoulder with the flat of the blade three times, "I accept your allegiance."



Nightingale's shoulders trembled slightly, as if she had finally relaxed.



He then extended his right hand towards her.



Nightingale took his fingers and lightly kissed the back of his hand. With that, the entire ritual was complete.



Although it was highly unconventional for a witch to perform the rite of fealty, the fact that she could perform the entire sequence indicated that Nightingale was not of common birth. And the name she had just mentioned, Veronica... "Is that your real name, with no surname?" Roland asked, pulling her up.



"Yes, Your Highness. I have no intention of hiding anything from you. Five years ago, I severed ties with the Grant family, and that surname no longer has anything to do with me," Nightingale candidly stated, as she let down her last guard and simply recounted her past to Roland.



She was born in Silver City, a city named for its rich silver mines. Her father was a viscount, and her mother was a commoner. Such marriages were uncommon, but the two got along very well. In addition, Nightingale had a younger brother named Hide. She spent her childhood in Silver City, which was also the most joyful time of her life.
