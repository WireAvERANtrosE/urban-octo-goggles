## The Church's Invitation
On the fourth day, Roland summoned all the nobles, big and small, from the stronghold and its vicinity to the castle hall.

Although most people were already aware of the news, he felt it was necessary to emphasize in person once more—the Western Region had a new master.

When he declared that he would return to Border Town and leave the stronghold in the care of the eldest son of the Honeysuckle Family, the crowd immediately burst into discussion. Of course, no one wished to be the first to express their objections at this time. The duke's head was still hanging high at the city gates, and the news of Timothy's crushing defeat left speculators without any external support to rely on.

Apart from the knights of the Honeysuckle Family who were ransomed back, all other captured knights were not to be ransomed. Along with the mercenaries, they would all be escorted back to Border Town. In Roland's plan, the mercenaries were to be sent to work in the mines for reformation through labor, while the knights, after their repentance was assessed, would be employed at his discretion—after all, most knights were literate and could serve as teachers to promote education. Of course, they would never be allowed to bear arms again in their lifetimes.

In this way, the power of the Honeysuckle Family would firmly suppress that of the other four major houses. The armed forces in their hands would be sufficient to defend the Longsong Stronghold and their own earldom, Roland thought. As for the undercurrents stirring in the shadows, that was something for Peter to worry about.

During these days, he also took the time to dispatch his personal guards to capture a number of officials who caused the starvation and freezing deaths of the residents of Border Town two years ago. Among them was the Minister of Finance, Ferreno. They would face the people's trial in Border Town. The only regret was that Earl Hightower Mead, the main culprit who attempted to burn the food supplies and kill the Ashen Wolves, did not undergo trial and died directly on the battlefield.

Now, with the traffic between Longsong Stronghold and Border Town fully restored, in the coming week, more than a dozen ships would be transporting a continuous flow of resources to Border Town every day. Roland guessed that Barov would certainly be overwhelmed, both with receiving the coins plundered from the duke and with settling a large number of immigrants. He wondered whether the temporary wooden shacks entrusted to Karl for construction had been completed.

Thinking of this, he could not help but want to return to Border Town as soon as possible to oversee the upcoming farming endeavors.

After hosting a luncheon for the nobles, Roland planned to take a nap when a special guest arrived at the castle.



High Priest Thylo of the Longsong Stronghold church.



Roland immediately lost all desire to sleep.



Unlike Border Town, the church had long been rooted in this place, not only building a church but also dispatching a High Priest to be stationed here. This was also the main reason why the prince decided to return to Border Town and focus on its development—under the long-term indoctrination and influence of the church, any civilian could potentially become their informant. His plans to involve the public would be hindered at every turn, and the risk of the witches being discovered would increase manifold. Unless he uprooted the church entirely, his reforms would be extremely difficult to implement.



For the church to pay close attention to the change of the lord of the stronghold was quite normal, and Roland was actually surprised that they had waited until today to send a representative to deal with him. However, the identity of the visitor was not simple—the followers who served as High Priests were already high-ranking members of the church, responsible for overseeing a region, similar to the secular rank of a duke.



He received the other party in the hall as usual.



High Priest Thylo was a middle-aged man, dressed in the church's standard white robe with blue edges, about forty years old, both his attire and appearance were very neat, and his manners were like those of a courteous nobleman. If it wasn't for the fact that he was sitting on the side of the witches and the royal family, probably anyone would find pleasure in conversing with such a person.



The High Priest surely carried high-quality God's Punishment Stones with him, and to avoid accidents, Roland had specifically instructed Nightingale to stay away from the area where the other party was before the meeting.



After Thylo saluted, Roland invited him to sit down and ordered the servants to serve tea.



No matter what he thought inside, he still had to show proper etiquette on the surface.



"Respected Prince, I bring blessings from the Holy City," Thylo said with a smile, "You have truly become the lord of the Western Region, may the deities bless you."

"Thank you," Roland replied in a relaxed tone, "It seems that you don't care at all that I killed the Duke of Lion and took over Longsong Stronghold."

"We rarely interfere in secular disputes, as long as the people can live better lives, that is what makes a wise monarch. It does not matter which family he was born into, or whether he comes from the royal family; these are not the concerns of the Church. In fact, the Church does not consider one's status when promoting someone. I was once just a farmer's son, and now I can serve as High Priest within the Church," he laughed, "Forgive my frankness, Your Highness, but I'm afraid no farmer's son could become a Duke, right?"

If he started a rebellion to overthrow the royal family, he himself could even become king. Roland thought to himself, but didn't argue out loud, instead, he changed the subject, "So, did you come here today just to offer blessings?"

"Blessings are only a part of it, I also bring a proposal for cooperation."

"Cooperation? Cooperation on what?"

"We can offer you help within our power in expanding your territory and influence."

"Wait a minute..." Roland frowned, "You just said that the Church rarely interferes in secular disputes."

"Rarely interfering does not mean never interfering," the High Priest continued calmly, "The current struggle between your brother Timothy and the Third Princess Grace has already made life miserable for the people of the Southern Territory. I have said before, as long as one can provide the people with a stable and peaceful life, the Church will recognize him as a monarch worthy of respect. And you, Your Highness, are just such a person."



Roland was startled, was the other party indicating that they wanted to help him compete for the throne? He asked subconsciously, "Why?"



"You led the people of Border Town to fight against the demonic beasts and safely got through the Evil Months, which proves your courage and ability. The large amount of food purchased from Willow Town shows that you do not want your people to starve or freeze, which is a display of compassion. Possessing these three noble qualities, while also being of royal blood, is the reason we have chosen you."



Roland didn't believe in the reasons given by the other party, but at least these words proved that even when Border Town was in a state of isolation due to heavy snow, the Church was still watching over this remote land.



"How do you plan to help, by sending the Judgement Army to fight for me?"



"We also wish to quell the chaos as soon as possible, but doing so would provoke the resentment of most of the nobles, so we can only offer material support," the High Priest took out two pills from his bosom, one red and one black, "These are from the Holy City's God's Prayer Room—equivalent to the drugs produced by your alchemy workshop. The red pill can temporarily give your subordinates great strength, while the black pill can increase their endurance to pain, severe cold, and scorching heat by several times. With these drugs, your army will be unstoppable. And the Church only charges the basic cost of production," he paused, "five Gold Royals per pill. As for these two pills, they can be considered as samples given to you to prove that my words are true."



"What do you ask for in return? To expand the congregation and build churches in every territory?"



"That would certainly be good, but our main intention is to pacify the chaos. As long as the people settle down, they will naturally embrace God."



Roland accepted the pills, "It sounds miraculous, but I have no immediate plans to vie for the crown of Greycastle, whether it be Timothy or Garcia, they are my close kin, and I do not wish to harm them."



"I understand," the High Priest smiled, "but sometimes, kinship cannot stop the temptation of power, especially when you become a stumbling block on their path to seizing power. The pills are just the beginning, there is much more assistance we can offer. If you decide to take that step, you can always come to the church to find me." With that, he stood up, bowed, and said, "I have brought the Church's decision, may the deities be with you, Your Highness."
