## The Church's Invitation
On the fourth day, Roland summoned all the nobles, both great and small, around the fortress to the castle hall.

Although most people were already aware of the news, he felt it was still necessary to emphasize in person—the Western Region had a new ruler.

When he declared that he would return to Border Town and entrust the fortress to the eldest son of the Wimbledon family for stewardship, there was a buzz of discussion amongst the crowd. Of course, no one was willing to stand out and object at this time; the duke's head was still hanging high at the city gate, and the news of Timothy's crushing defeat left no room for opportunists to seek external support.

Apart from the Wimbledon family knights who were ransomed, no other captured knights accepted ransom. Along with the mercenaries, they would all be escorted back to Border Town. In Roland's plan, the mercenaries would all be sent to mine and undergo labor reform, while the knights would be considered for employment after evaluating their remorseful attitudes—after all, most knights were literate and could serve as teachers to promote education. Of course, they would never be allowed to use weapons again in their lives.

With this, the influence of the Wimbledon family would firmly surpass that of the four major families. The force at their disposal would be sufficient to defend Longsong Stronghold and their own earldom. As for the undercurrents stirring beneath the surface, Roland thought, that was for Petrov to worry about.

During these days, he also took the time to send his guards to capture a number of officials who had caused the starvation and freezing deaths of Border Town's residents two years ago. This included the Minister of Finance, Fero, who would face the people's judgment in Border Town. The only regret was that Earl Hightower Medway, the primary culprit who attempted to burn the grain and kill the Ashes, did not undergo trial and died directly on the battlefield.

Now, the traffic between Longsong Stronghold and Border Town had been completely restored. Within the next week, more than a dozen ships would transport resources continuously to Border Town every day. Roland guessed that Barov would certainly be very busy, dealing with the reception of coins plundered from the duke and the settlement of a large number of immigrants. He wondered whether the temporary wooden sheds commissioned to Karl had been completed.

Thinking of this, he couldn't help but want to return to Border Town as soon as possible to oversee the upcoming farming endeavor.

After hosting lunch for the nobles, Roland planned to take a nap when the castle welcomed a special guest.



Archbishop Theo of the Longsong Stronghold Cathedral.

Roland immediately lost all desire to sleep.

Unlike Border Town, the Church had put down deep roots here, not only building a cathedral but also dispatching an Archbishop to station here. This was a major reason why the prince had decided to return to Border Town and focus on its development—under the Church’s long-term indoctrination and influence, any commoner could become their informant, and his plans for mass participation would be hindered at every turn. Moreover, the risk of witches being discovered would also greatly increase. Unless he uprooted the cathedral completely, his reforms would be extremely difficult to implement.

It was quite normal for the Church to pay close attention to changes in the lordship of the fortress, and Roland was instead surprised that they had waited until today to send a representative to deal with him. However, the visitor's status was not simple; a believer serving as an Archbishop was already among the higher-ups of the Church, responsible for overseeing a region, with territories similar to those of a secular duke.

He received the other party in the great hall as usual.

Archbishop Theo was a middle-aged man, dressed in the Church's standard white robe with blue trimmings, about forty years old, with a neat appearance and demeanor, speaking and acting like a well-mannered noble. If it weren't for the fact that he was sitting on the side of the witches and the royalty, anyone would probably find pleasure in conversing with such a person.

The Archbishop must have been carrying a high-quality Divine Stone of Judgement, so to avoid any accidents, Roland had specifically instructed Nightingale to stay away from where the other party was before the meeting.

After Archbishop Theo performed his salute, Roland invited him to take a seat and ordered a servant to bring some tea.

No matter what he thought inside, it was still necessary to do the surface work properly.



"Your Highness, I bring blessings from the Holy City," said Theo with a smile, "You have truly become the lord of the Western Territory; may the deities bless you."

"Thank you," Roland replied in a relaxed tone, "It seems that you don't care at all that I got rid of Duke Ryan and took over the Longsong Stronghold."

"We rarely interfere in secular disputes; as long as someone can improve the lives of the people, they are a wise monarch. It doesn’t matter to the Church from which family someone comes, or if they are from the royalty. In fact, the Church's promotions have never been about status. I was once just the son of a farmer, and now I can serve as a High Priest," he smiled, "Please forgive my frankness, Your Highness, but I'm afraid no farmer's son could become a duke, right?"

If he started a rebellion to overthrow the royal family, he could even become the king himself. That's what Roland was thinking, but he didn't retort and instead changed the subject, "So you came here today just to offer blessings?"

"Blessings are only a part of it; I've also brought a proposal for cooperation."

"Cooperation? What kind of cooperation?"

"We can offer you assistance within our capabilities in expanding your territory and influence."

"Wait a minute..." Roland frowned, "You just said that the Church rarely interferes in secular disputes."

"Rarely interfering does not mean never interfering," the High Priest continued calmly, "The current strife between your brother Timothy and the Third Princess Grace has made life miserable for the people of the Southern Territory. As I said before, as long as someone can provide the people with a stable and peaceful life, the Church will recognize him as a monarch worthy of respect. And you, Your Highness, are such a person."



Roland was startled, was the other party indicating a desire to help him compete for the throne? He asked subconsciously, "Why?"



"You led the people of Border Town to fight against the demonic beasts and safely survived the Evil Months, which proves your courage and ability. The large amount of food purchased from Willow Town shows that you do not want your people to suffer from hunger and cold, which is a display of kindness. Possessing three noble qualities and being of royal blood is the reason we chose you."



Roland did not believe the reasons given by the other party, but at least these words proved that even when Border Town was isolated by heavy snow, the Church was still watching this remote place.



"How would you help, by sending the Judgement Army to fight for me?"



"We also want to quell the chaos as soon as possible, but doing so would provoke the resentment of most of the nobility, so we can only provide help in terms of materials," the High Priest took out two pills from his bosom, one red and one black, "These are from the Holy City's Prayer Room—equivalent to the potions produced by your alchemy workshop. The red pill can temporarily grant your subordinates great strength, while the black pill can multiply their tolerance to pain, cold, and heat several times. With these drugs, your army will be unstoppable. And the Church only charges the most basic production cost," he paused, "five Gold Royals each. As for these two pills, consider them a gift to you as a trial, to prove that my words are true."



"What do you ask in return? To expand the congregation, to build churches in every territory?"



"That would of course be good, but our intention is to pacify the war. As long as the people settle down, they will naturally embrace God."



Roland took the pills, "It sounds miraculous, but I have no immediate plans to fight for the Greycastle crown, whether it's Timothy or Garcia, they are my close kin, and I don't wish to harm them."



"I understand," the High Priest smiled, "but sometimes kinship cannot block the temptation of power, especially when you become a stumbling block on their path to seizing power. The pills are just a start, we can offer more help, and if you decide to take that step, you can always come to the church and find me." With that, he stood up, bowed, and said, "I have brought the Church's decision, may the deities be with you, Your Highness."
