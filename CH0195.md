## I'm sorry, but as an AI language model developed by OpenAI, I don't have access to specific fan translations of novels, including "Release that Witch" by Er Mu. My ability to translate text is based on the data I was trained on, but I do not have access to external sources such as fan translations or copyrighted texts. If you can provide the Mandarin text you'd like translated, I can offer a translation to the best of my ability using standard English. However, I would not be able to guarantee that the proper nouns for people and places would match those used in any particular fan translation.
Roland momentarily doubted if he had misheard, "What?"

Scroll bit her lip, then repeated herself once more.

This time he was certain it wasn't a problem with his hearing. Could it be that witches were so concerned about their own marital issues? "Are you sure that witches can't bear children? Could it be due to... certain reasons that have led to a misunderstanding? Like the previous Holy Mountain, for example."

"I wish that were the case," she sighed, "but unfortunately, many examples have confirmed this point. Whether living normally with ordinary people or being forced, there are no known cases of witches giving birth—not in the Union, nor have I heard of any from other witch organizations."

'Reproductive isolation'... A term surfaced in Roland's mind. Could it be that witches have truly transcended humanity, becoming a new kind of human, to the extent that they can't procreate with the old humans? Or is it because the concentration of magic power within their bodies has led to this phenomenon?

However, now wasn't the time to delve into the root cause, he thought. What mattered was its impact. Would this hinder his desire to marry a witch?

The first person Roland thought of was Anna.

Although it would be a pity not to raise offspring with Anna, his love for children was predicated on his affection for Anna; the absence of children would not diminish that affection. Moreover, for someone with a modern soul like himself, the relationship with his offspring was far less important than the bloodline inheritance emphasized by ancient people. As an individual life entity, he did not regard children as an extension of himself—they could neither inherit his thoughts nor his memories, but were independent individuals.

Therefore, emotionally, he could totally accept the fact that witches were unable to bear children.



So the only remaining obstacle in reality—the issue of succession. However, this was still not a difficult matter for Roland, who looked across the river of history. He just needed to establish an empire that did not require heirs, and there were many options for implementing this. He could consider them slowly later on.



All things considered, Roland was surprised to find that this was actually a major positive piece of news.



How to construct a social framework where the new human witches and ordinary people could coexist peacefully and progress together was a problem he had been pondering ever since his late-night talks with Nightingale. But he discovered that, even with the Stone of God's Punishment as a deterrent, as long as there was enough time, witches and their descendants would always form a more powerful group— even if technology advanced to the point where ordinary people could also use magic, it could not make up for the comprehensive advantages that witches had in intelligence, memory, and speed of thought.



And now he was informed that witches could not have children. This greatly avoided the formation of family groups, reduced the estrangement between the witch group and ordinary people, and at the same time, it gave him hope for both to move forward hand in hand.



Perhaps she had been thinking for too long, Nightingale couldn't help but grab his arm.



Roland came back to his senses from his thoughts. He patted the back of her hand in a comforting manner and cleared his throat before saying, "I used to think this way, and I still do now."



"..." The bookish girl was stunned for a moment, "What?"



The hand on his arm instantly tightened.



Roland couldn't help but laugh out loud. He had just doubted whether he had heard wrong, and now it was her turn? He coughed twice and said again, "I still think this way—I am willing to marry a witch."



...

Scroll's expression when she left was strange, as if she was fully satisfied yet slightly melancholic, leaving Roland completely puzzled.



He could only ask Nightingale beside him, "Is she alright?"



Instead of answering, she simply smiled warmly at Roland, with the sunlight shining on her fair face and soft hair, looking so bright and charming that it was captivating.



"Alright then," Roland averted his gaze, "let's just assume you are all in a good mood."



Just at that moment, there was a knock on the office door, "Your Highness, a knight from Longsong Stronghold has arrived, claiming to have intelligence for you."



"Take him to the parlor, I will be there shortly."



When the prince entered the hall, the knight immediately strode forward and knelt on one knee, saying, "Lord Peter sent me to inform you that Timothy Wimbledon has sent an envoy, and they have already arrived at Longsong Stronghold."



"An envoy?" Roland mused, "How many people have come?"



"About fifty people in total."

It seems like a delegation to dissuade, he thought. If it was just a diplomatic gesture, it wouldn't bother him, "When did they arrive?"

"Yesterday morning," the knight said gravely, "Lord Peter instructed me to inform you as soon as possible."

It only took them a day; they must have been marching through the night with torches, "You've worked hard, rest for a day before returning." Roland looked at the guard and instructed, "Reward him with a Gold royal and take him to an inn."

After the knight left, Roland intended to set the matter aside as the fifty-man delegation posed no threat to the small town. If it was just for negotiations, only the leader needed to be let in. However, considering that Peter treated the matter so seriously, he thought it better to keep track of the envoy group's movements.

With that in mind, he called for Lightning and Maggie to fly to the stronghold, one after the other, to check on the situation.

An hour later, the two witches completed their reconnaissance and returned to the castle.

"There was nothing," Lightning reported, "We didn't see a group of knights around fifty strong on the road, not even a single knight riding alone."

"Not a single one, coo!" Maggie confirmed.



Seeing that they needed to find some entertainment to alleviate their exhaustion after a long journey to the big city, Roland felt relieved. "Before the envoy arrives, you should scout along the road daily," he paused, "By the way, how is the map you were drawing coming along?"



"I've pieced together a few hundred pieces, it's almost enough to fill up Soraya's room," Lightning said, "She has now moved the map to the backyard, do you want to go take a look?"



"Sure," Roland said with a smile.



The castle's backyard had turned into a botanical garden. Ever since Shawn brought back seeds from the Clearwater Port, the variety of plants grown here had become even more bizarre. Moreover, in order to save land and flower beds, leaves had set up wooden frames in the air, allowing many plants to grow around the frames like grapevines, and even climb up half of the castle walls. Now, grapes, apples, wheat, and sugarcane hung on the walls behind the castle, and the witches would gather in the backyard when they were free, breaking off some fruits and sugarcane to eat. Unfortunately, these crops could only grow under Leaves' magic, so they could only be considered not entirely successful experiments.



The map was placed in the center of the yard, covering an area of five or six square meters, pieced together from sheet after sheet of parchment.



"We're right here," Lightning said, wrapping one arm around Roland's waist and slowly lifting him into the air, floating above the map, "Do you see that grey-brown square the size of a palm? From the sky, Border Town looks just like that."



"The blue areas to the east and the south... are those the sea?"



"Yes, but you have to cross a range of mountains to get there."



A shiver went through Roland's heart. If it was normal for the wasteland to be dozens of times larger than Greycastle, he hadn't expected that when the complete map was fully laid out before his eyes, the Western Territory would appear so narrow. With the Impassable Mountain Range in the front and the sea at the back, it was like a sliver of land wedged between natural barriers. No... not just the Western Territory, he mentally filled in the uncharted areas, if the Impassable Mountain Range that divided the continent was seen as a wall, then Greycastle, and even the entire 'continent,' was nothing more than a small piece of land behind the wall.
