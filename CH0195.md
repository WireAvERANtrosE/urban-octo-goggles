Roland momentarily doubted whether he had heard incorrectly, "What?"

Scroll bit her lip and repeated herself.

This time he was sure it wasn't a problem with his hearing. Could it be that witches were so concerned about their own marital issues? "Are you certain witches are infertile? Could it be due to... some reasons that have led to a misunderstanding? Like the former Holy Mountain, for example."

"I wish it were so," she sighed, "but sadly, many examples have confirmed this point. There are no known cases of witches giving birth, whether in normal relations with ordinary people or forced by others—neither the Union has any, nor have other witch organizations heard of such cases."

"Reproductive isolation"... The term surfaced in Roland's mind. Could it be that witches had truly transcended ordinary humans to become a new species, to the extent that they were unable to procreate with the old humans? Or was it a phenomenon caused by the concentration of magical power within their bodies?

However, now was not the time to get to the root of the matter, he thought. The key was its impact. Would this pose an obstacle to his desire to marry a witch?

The first person Roland thought of was Anna.

Although it was a bit regrettable that he couldn't have offspring with Anna, his fondness for children was predicated on his love for Anna, and the absence of children would not diminish this love. Moreover, for him, who possessed a modern soul, lineage and bloodline were not as important as they were to the ancients. As an individual life form, he did not regard children as an extension of himself—the latter could neither inherit thoughts nor memories but was an independent and autonomous person.

So emotionally, he could entirely accept the fact that witches were infertile.



So, the only remaining obstacle in reality was the issue of succession. However, for Roland who looked through the long river of history, this was still not a difficult matter. He simply needed to establish an empire that did not require an heir. There were many options for how to implement this, and he could consider them slowly later on.

Overall, Roland was surprised to find that this was actually a major piece of good news.

How to construct a social framework where the new human witches and ordinary people could coexist peacefully and progress together was a problem he had been pondering ever since his night talks with Nightingale. But he realized that, even with the restraint of the Divine Stone of Judgement, as long as there was enough time, witches and their descendants would always form a more powerful group— even if technology developed to the point where ordinary people could use magic, it would still not compensate for the witches' comprehensive advantages in intelligence, memory, and speed of thought.

And now he was being told that witches could not bear children. This greatly avoided the formation of family groups, weakened the gap between the witch community and ordinary people, and simultaneously allowed him to see the hope of the two joining hands and advancing together.

Perhaps because she had been thinking for too long, Nightingale couldn't help but grab his arm.

Roland came back to his senses from his thoughts, and patted her hand on the back as a form of comfort, clearing his throat before saying, "I was thinking that before, and I still think so now."

"..." Scroll was stunned for a moment. "What?"

The hand on his arm suddenly tightened.

Roland couldn't help but laugh out loud. Before, he had doubted whether he had heard wrong, and now was it her turn? He coughed twice and repeated, "I still think so now—I am willing to marry a witch as my wife."



The expression on Scroll's face as she left was strange, a mix of satisfaction and a touch of sorrow, leaving Roland utterly confused.



He could only turn to Nightingale beside him and ask, "Is she alright?"



Instead of answering, Nightingale just smiled at Roland, the sunlight from the window illuminating her fair complexion and smooth hair, so radiant it was captivating.



"Alright, then," Roland averted his gaze, "I'll take it that you are both in good spirits."



Just then, there was a knock on the office door. "Your Highness, a knight from Longsong Stronghold has arrived with intelligence for you."



"Take him to the parlor, I'll be there shortly."



When the prince entered the hall, the knight strode forward and knelt on one knee, "Lord Petrov has sent me to inform you, Timothy Wimbledon has dispatched an envoy, and they have already arrived at Longsong Stronghold."



"An envoy?" Roland mused, "How many people have they brought?"



"About fifty people in total."

It seems like a persuasion team, he thought. If it's just a diplomatic gesture, it doesn't really bother me. "When did they arrive?"

"Yesterday morning," the knight said gravely, "Lord Petrov instructed me to hurry and inform you as soon as possible."

It only took them one day; they must have been traveling at night with torches. "You've worked hard. Rest for a day before returning," Roland instructed the guard, "Reward him with a Gold royal and take him to the inn."

After the knight left, Roland initially thought to put the matter aside since a fifty-man troop posed no threat to the town, and if it was just for negotiations, only the leader needed to be let in. However, considering that Petrov had dealt with it so cautiously, he decided it was better to keep track of the envoy's movements at all times.

With that in mind, he summoned Lightning and Maggie, asking them to fly to the fortress one after the other to check the situation.

An hour later, the two witches had completed their reconnaissance and returned to the castle.

"We didn't find anything," Lightning reported, "We didn't see a group of knights of about fifty people on the roads, not even a single straggler."

"Not a single one, coo!" Maggie confirmed.



It seems that after their long journey to the big city, they needed to find some entertainment for themselves to relieve their weary bodies. Roland let out a sigh of relief, "Before the envoy arrives, scout along the route every day." He paused, "By the way, how's the map you were drawing coming along?"



"I've pieced together probably hundreds of them, almost enough to fill up Soraya's room," Lightning said. "She's moved the maps to the backyard now, do you want to go take a look?"



"Sure." Roland smiled.



The castle's backyard had turned into a botanical garden. Ever since Shawn brought back the crop seeds from Clearwater port, the variety of plants grown here had become even more bizarre. Moreover, to save land and flower beds, Leaf had set up wooden frames overhead, allowing many plants to grow wrapped around the frames like grapevines, and even climbing up half the castle walls. Now, the wall behind the castle was adorned with grapes, apples, wheat, and sugarcane. When the witches had nothing else to do, they would gather in the backyard and break off some fruits and sugarcane from the wall to eat. Unfortunately, these crops could only grow under Leaf’s magic, so they were only partially successful experiments.



The map was placed in the center of the yard, covering an area of five to six square meters, made up of sheepskin paper stitched together.



"We are here," Lightning, with one arm around Roland's waist, slowly lifted him into the air and floated over the map, "Do you see that palm-sized gray-brown square? From the sky, Border Town looks just like that."



"The blue areas to the east and south... are they the sea?"



"Yes, but you have to cross a range of mountains to get there."



Roland felt a chill in his heart. It was one thing for the wasteland to be dozens of times larger than Greycastle, but he had not expected the Western Territory to appear so narrow when the full map was laid out before his eyes. With the Impassable Mountain Range to the front and the sea to the back, it was like a strip of land sandwiched between natural barriers. No... not just the Western Territory, he completed the uncharted parts in his mind; if the Impassable Mountain Range that divided the continent was seen as a wall, then Greycastle, even the whole "continent," was just a small piece of land beyond the wall.
