## Soraya's "painting"
After Barov left, Roland placed the statistics report into a drawer, looked towards Nightingale, and wanted to ask her what was wrong. However, after hesitating for a moment, he ultimately couldn't bring himself to ask.

He had a faint idea in his heart, but bringing it up always felt awkward, and it would be even more embarrassing if he guessed wrong. Thus, Roland swallowed his words and said, "Let's go to the North Slope Mine next."

"Do you want to see what changes Soraya's new ability has undergone?" Although Nightingale's behavior had become somewhat strange, her attitude was still the same as before. She lifted her hood and smiled, "Let's go."

Perhaps he was overthinking it, Roland thought, as he watched the witch quickly walk up beside him.

The impact of that day's balloon flight went far beyond one or two people.

He never expected that Soraya would become the second witch whose ability underwent a qualitative change.

In fact, even she herself had not noticed this change.

It was only by chance that Roland discovered it yesterday.

Ever since he gave the hot air balloon to Anna as a gift, it had always been placed in the castle courtyard. Anyone who wanted to go up and see the view just needed to call on Anna and Lightning. It was only the previous day when it rained that Roland suddenly remembered that the wicker basket would soften and peel after soaking in water, and even after drying, its toughness would be reduced, so he thought of bringing it back into the castle.



He had originally planned to have his servant do this, but on second thought, since the hot air balloon was a gift he had given to Anna, and parts like the ropes and the envelope were easily damaged, he decided to move it back to the castle himself. Calling Hummingbird to join him in the front courtyard, what he saw took him by surprise.

The basket was covered in drawings—views of Border Town from a bird's-eye perspective, but unlike the photographic style she had used before, this time her paintings seemed to stand up. Roland, not minding the falling raindrops, leaned in for a closer look and realized that for the first time, her paintings had 'thickness.'

It was not strange for a painting to have thickness—in theory, real paintings should have thickness because the paint itself has thickness. In oil painting, this thickness can even be exploited: using brushstrokes, brushes, or a palette knife to create a textured relief, using layers to enhance the texture and expressiveness of the painting.

But Soraya's case was different; her paintings were not made with brushes and paints, but were manifestations of magic.

And so, the thickness shaped by this magic seemed all the more peculiar.

He remembered when he lightly touched the protruding forests with his hand, it felt as though he was really brushing against branches and green leaves. They were not hard solids but were somewhat soft, gel-like substances. And when touching the ground, the sensation was much harder, as if he was really touching a stone.

It was unbelievable.

And the rainwater flowed down the landscape painting, unable to penetrate the wickerwork in the slightest.

Back at the castle, he immediately called for Soraya, and Nightingale also confirmed this. Under the observation of the Mist, the magic within Soraya's body was no longer a golden gaseous vortex as before, but had condensed into a continuously rotating... ribbon.



Walking into the military workshop courtyard, Anna greeted Roland with a big smile and gave him a big hug. 

Ever since their relationship became clear, her affectionate actions in front of him had noticeably increased. Roland was in a great mood and rubbed her head, the silver hairpin in her hair sparkling in the sunlight. 

However, out of the corner of his eye, he noticed that Soraya, who had also been preparing to come over to greet him, stood still, unsure of what to do. In the end, she turned away with a flushed face, pretending she hadn't seen anything. 

"Ahem," Nightingale pulled Soraya back to the table, deliberately asking loudly, "Did you draw all of these?" 

Roland shook his head with a smile, let go of Anna, and walked over with her. 

The table was covered with Soraya's drawings, which depicted the scenery that could be seen in the courtyard. The only difference lay in the thickness of the drawings; some were only about a millimeter higher than the paper, while others were close to three centimeters thick—this was the training content Roland had arranged for her this morning, to test how thick the 'paint' created by magic power could be spread. 

"Is this the thickest one?" Roland touched the three-centimeter-thick scroll with his finger. When he touched the part of the sky enchanted with blue, the 'paint' felt so soft it seemed to lack any texture, but as he slid his finger down to the courtyard wall, he immediately felt a sand-like friction. 

It seemed that, just as he had guessed, the things drawn by the evolved Magic Brush not only maintained the shape and color of the real objects but even the texture was close to the real thing.



"It could be thicker, but beyond this thickness, the magic consumption becomes very large," Soraya pointed to a brown protrusion on the table, "I originally wanted to paint a tree outside the wall, but just after drawing the trunk, it consumed half of my magic."



"Is this something you drew?" Roland measured with his hand and found that the paint was as thick as ten centimeters, "I thought it was a piece of bark standing up."



Despite saying that, its adhesion to the tabletop was exceptionally strong. The prince grabbed the bark and lifted it upwards until two of the table legs lifted off the ground, yet the bark did not separate from the table.



Nightingale drew her dagger and scraped for a long time before she managed to cut a small opening at the bottom, "This thing seems to be embedded into the table."



In the end, it was Anna who cut it open. Blackfire turned into threads sweeping across the tabletop, the paint emitted a puff of white smoke, and fell off in response. The cut was smooth but not polished, with black burn marks. Roland picked up the fallen piece of paint and only then realized it was lighter than he had imagined.



"Why did you suddenly decide to change your painting style... no, I mean, how did you decide to fill the painting with thickness?" he asked.



"I think, probably because it was the first time I saw such a scenery," Soraya said while recalling, "It was when I was overlooking the earth from the sky that I realized the paintings I made before—what you called 'photo works' that could almost rival real scenes—were actually not real, especially after I sketched the scenery from the basket. I felt that even more." She paused slightly, slowing down her speech, "The treetops are pointed and sway with the wind, the mountains have their highs and lows, like heaving chests, rivers embedded in the earth, with boats traveling on them. This is what I saw, not just a thin, flat surface. So I wanted the painting to be more realistic, to stand up like those magnificent sceneries. But I failed several times and was a bit discouraged... then I suddenly remembered the small spheres you talked about."



"Small spheres?" Roland raised an eyebrow.



"Yes," she nodded slightly embarrassedly, "the knowledge you taught us. I thought if everything is composed of small spheres, then could the patterns I draw also be the same? I tried a few more times, imagining the patterns under the magic pen as colorful spheres stacking on each other, eventually forming solid blocks of color. Then... the painting suddenly began to move, the green forests rose, the dark green rivers sank, and it became what you see now. That transformation took me and Anna by surprise. If you hadn't mentioned it to me later, I would have never thought it was an evolution of my ability."



"So that's how it is."

"However, compared to Anna's Blackfire, my evolution ability seems to have no other use than making my paintings more vivid," Soraya stuck out her tongue.

"No... How could that be?" Roland shook his head, "In my eyes, it's not just a simple painting."

It would be a waste to use this ability for painting alone, he thought of the scene where rainwater slid over the surface of the basket but couldn't soak in at all—rather than calling it paint, it's more like a 'coating' made of magical power.
