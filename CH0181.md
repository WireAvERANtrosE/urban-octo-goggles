## Soraya's "Painting"
After Barov left, Roland put the statistical report into the drawer and turned to Nightingale, wanting to ask her what was wrong, but after hesitating for a moment, he ultimately could not bring himself to ask.

He had a vague answer in his mind, but it always felt awkward to voice such things, and if he guessed wrong, it would be even more embarrassing. Roland could only swallow his words and said, "Let's go to the North Slope Mine next."

"Want to see what changes Soraya's new ability has undergone?" Nightingale's behavior had become somewhat strange, but her attitude was still the same as before. She took off her hood and smiled, "Let's go."

Perhaps he was overthinking it, Roland thought, watching the witch quickly step to his side.

The impact of that day's balloon ride was not limited to just one or two people.

He never expected that Soraya would become the second witch whose ability underwent a qualitative change.

In fact, even she herself had not noticed this change.

It was only by chance that Roland discovered it yesterday.

Since the hot air balloon had been given to Anna as a gift, it had been placed in the castle courtyard. If anyone wanted to go up and enjoy the view, they just had to call Anna and Lightning. It wasn't until it rained the day before that Roland suddenly realized the wicker basket would become soft and peel after soaking in water, and even after drying, its toughness would be reduced, so he thought of bringing it back into the castle.



He had originally planned to have a servant do this, but then he thought that since the hot air balloon was a gift he had given to Anna, and parts like the ropes and the gasbag were prone to damage, he decided to move it back to the castle himself. Calling Hummingbird to come to the front courtyard with him, the result was quite a surprise.



The basket was covered in drawings—all views of Border Town from a bird's-eye perspective. However, unlike the previous photographic style of drawing, this time her paintings looked as though they had stood up. Roland, unconcerned with the falling raindrops, leaned in for a closer look and realized that for the first time, her drawings had 'thickness'.



It was not strange for a painting to have thickness. In theory, real paintings should have thickness—because the paint itself has thickness. In oil painting, this thickness can even be utilized: creating uneven textures with brushstrokes, brushes, or palette knives, and through variations in layers to enhance the texture and increase the expressiveness of the image.



But Soraya was different. Her paintings were not made with brushes and paint, but were manifestations of magic.



Therefore, this thickness shaped by magic seemed particularly strange.



He remembered when he lightly touched those protruding forests with his hand, it felt as if he was really brushing past branches and green leaves. They were not hard solids, but rather slightly soft gel-like substances. And when touching the ground, the sensation was much harder, as if he was really touching a stone.



It was simply incredible.



And the rainwater flowed down the landscape paintings without soaking into the wicker at all.



Back in the castle, he immediately called for Soraya, and Nightingale confirmed it as well. Under the observation of the Mist, the magic power inside Soraya was no longer a golden gaseous vortex like before, but had condensed into a continuously rotating... ribbon.



Walking into the courtyard of the military factory, Anna greeted Roland with a bright smile and gave him a big hug. Ever since they had clarified their relationship, her affectionate gestures in front of him had noticeably increased. Roland cheerfully ruffled her hair, the silver hairpin on her head sparkling in the sunlight.



However, out of the corner of his eye, he noticed that Soraya, who had also been preparing to come over to greet him, stood rooted to the spot, unsure of what to do. Eventually, she turned away with a flushed face, pretending not to have seen anything.



"Ahem," Nightingale, pulling Soraya back to the table, asked deliberately out loud, "Did you draw all of these?"



Roland shook his head with a smile, released Anna, and walked over with her.



The table was covered with Soraya's drawings, which depicted the scenes that could be seen in the courtyard. The only difference lay in the thickness of the drawings; some were only about a millimeter higher than the paper, while others were close to three centimeters thick—this was also the training content Roland had arranged for her that morning, to test how thick the 'paint' made from magic power could be spread at most.



"Is this the thickest one?" Roland touched the drawing that was three centimeters thick with his finger. When he touched the part of the sky that was enchanted in blue, the paint felt so soft it seemed almost without texture. But sliding his finger down to the courtyard wall, he immediately felt a sand-like friction.



It seemed that just as he had guessed, after evolving, the magic pen could not only make the drawings' shape and color consistent with the real object, but even the texture was close to the real thing.



"It could be thicker, but beyond that thickness, the consumption of magic power becomes very large," Soraya pointed to a brown protrusion on the table, "I originally wanted to draw a tree outside the wall, but after just drawing the trunk, it used up half of my magic power."



"Was this drawn by you?" Roland measured with his hand and found that the paint was as thick as ten centimeters thick, "I thought it was a piece of bark standing up."



Despite saying so, its adhesion to the table was exceptionally firm. The prince grabbed the bark and lifted it upwards until two legs of the table left the ground, yet the bark did not separate from the table.



Nightingale pulled out her dagger and spent a long time cutting until she made a tiny incision at the bottom, "This thing seems to be embedded in the table."



In the end, it was Anna who cut it open. Blackfire turned into threads sweeping across the table surface, smoke billowed from the paint, and it fell off in response. The cut was even but not smooth, with black burn marks. Roland picked up the fallen piece of paint and only then realized that it was much lighter than he had imagined.



"Why did you suddenly decide to change your style... no, I mean, how did you decide to fill the drawing with thickness?" he asked.



"I think, probably because it was the first time seeing such a scenery," Soraya said as she reminisced, "It was only when I looked down at the earth from the sky that I realized, those paintings I made before—what you called 'works almost comparable to real scenes'—they were not real, especially after I depicted the landscape from the basket, I felt this even more." She paused briefly and slowed her speech, "The treetops are pointed and sway with the wind, the mountains are of varied heights, like undulating chests, rivers are embedded in the earth, and ships sail upon them. This is what I saw, not just a thin flat surface. So I wanted to make the painting more real, to have it stand up like those magnificent landscapes. But I tried several times and couldn't succeed... just when I was feeling a bit frustrated, I suddenly remembered the small spheres you mentioned."



"Small spheres?" Roland raised an eyebrow.



"Um," she nodded a little embarrassedly, "the knowledge you taught us. I thought if everything is made up of small spheres, then wouldn't the patterns I draw be the same? I tried a few more times, imagining the patterns under the magic pen as colorful spheres piling up on each other, eventually forming whole blocks of color. Then... the picture suddenly started to move, the green forest rose upwards, the dark green river sank down, and finally, it became what you see now. That change even startled Anna and me. If you hadn't mentioned it to me later, I wouldn't have thought at all that it was an evolution of my ability."



"So that's how it is."

"However, compared to Anna's Blackfire, my evolutionary ability seems to have no other use besides making my paintings more vivid," Soraya stuck out her tongue.

"No... how could that be?" Roland shook his head. "In my eyes, it's not just a simple painting."

If this ability were only used for painting, it would be too wasteful. He recalled the scene where rainwater slid over the surface of the basket but was unable to penetrate it at all—it was more like a 'coating' made of magical power rather than paint.
