## Westward
Petro yawned, sat up from the bed, and immediately felt a chill on his upper body. If possible, he wished he could stay in bed forever, not only for the warmth but also for Sheryl's company.

"Aren't you going to sleep a bit more?" The woman beside him turned over, mumbling sleepily, "Isn't it still early?"

He leaned down and kissed her forehead—Sheryl's brown hair was soft and curly, her skin as smooth as a baby's, and she had a pair of lovely big eyes. It was in the Longsong Theatre that they first met. Almost at first sight, he was firmly captivated by those eyes.

"It should be almost noon, I need to go downstairs to see if there's any official business to handle," Petro whispered, "If you don't want to get up, continue sleeping. Later, I'll have the servant bring lunch here to the bedroom."

"But I want you to stay with me," Sheryl stretched out her arm, hugging his waist, "With the snow falling outside, what kind of official business could there be to handle."

She wasn't wrong. Since the Evil Months began, the whole city had suddenly quieted down, the theatre only performed once a week, the merchants in the market all left, and the taverns closed their doors. If you walked the streets during the day, you might even think it was a ghost town.

So... should I sleep a bit longer? Having pursued Sheryl for nearly a year, now that he finally got his wish, Petro truly felt reluctant to leave her. The pleasure of last night had exhausted him, but now he was back to feeling energetic. After lunch, perhaps they could be intimate once again.

Just then, there was a knock on the bedroom door.

"Lord Petro, there is a blue envelope for you."



He froze for a moment, then immediately rolled out of bed, picked up the long robe that had been carelessly thrown on the ground, and draped it over his body. "I'll be right there."



"My lord?" Sheryl murmured softly.



"Just wait for me." Petro hurriedly fastened his belt and left the bedroom. After a while, he returned to the room, climbed back into bed, and had an envelope with a blue seal in his hand.



"What's this? Who wrote it to you?" The woman was now mostly awake. She yawned, sat up, and leaned against Petro.



"It's from Border Town," he replied. "It should be a personal letter from His Highness the Prince."



He tore open the seal, pulled out the letter, and quickly scanned the contents. His brow furrowed, "His Highness wants me to make a trip to Border Town."



"Now?" Sheryl asked in surprise. "You're going in this weather?"



"Yes, it must be something urgent." Petro sighed. "I'll get ready shortly and leave in the afternoon. You should go home first, and I'll come find you when I return." He couldn't help but recall the journey he made a year ago, braving the snow and taking a ship to Border Town to bring Duke Ryan the warning from Longsong Stronghold. And now, the reason for his travel to that barren land was a mere letter from the town's lord, which made Petro reflect on the fickleness of fate.



"Can't you just pretend you didn't see it?" she said, somewhat displeased. "Even if he has taken down Longsong Stronghold, you're the real person in charge of the stronghold. Even if it's the king's command, you don't necessarily have to carry it out immediately, right?"



If it were the Duke, he would indeed do so, but Petro deeply understood the temperament of the fourth prince. He indulgently stroked the other's head, "It's not the same. The King might not be able to manage the Western Region, but Prince Roland can... He is not only the Lord of Border Town but also the master of the entire Western Region."



...

After entering the Evil Months, Longsong Stronghold indeed did not have too many official duties to deal with. Petro simply delegated some tasks to his subordinates, and by the way, brought his father, Earl Herman, to sit in the castle, then set off from the stronghold. Unlike last time when he was accompanied by only one assistant, this time he was riding on the Duke's exclusive "Lionheart," with more than a dozen servants and apprentices each, plus two family knights, which could be described as a grand presence.



As he passed through the outer city district toward the stronghold's docks, the noise coming from a street corner attracted Petro's attention.



He saw about a dozen people surrounding a circle, seemingly watching something. Judging by their attire, these people should all be commoners, probably residents attracted by the noise from the vicinity. Occasionally, sharp cries such as "Devil!" and "Hang her!" erupted from within the circle.



Petro had a thought and said to the knight beside him, "Go take a look. If it's a common quarrel, have them roll back into their houses."



"Yes, my lord."



The knight pushed through the crowd on the perimeter and walked into the middle. After drawing his sword, the people quickly dispersed. He finally brought back a woman and two children, one of whom had a hemp rope tied around their neck.



"What's going on here?"



"My lord," the woman threw herself at Petro's feet, "kill her quickly! She has already fallen and become a witch!"

The word made Petro slightly startled, "A witch?" He shifted his gaze to the other two, the taller boy immediately stood in front of the girl, ready to pounce with a fierce look, but his face was bruised, obviously having been beaten up not long ago, "She is not a minion of the devil, it's all shown in the plays, witches can be good or bad, what right do you have to judge her?"

"Are you sure she is a witch?" Petro asked, ignoring the boy and continuing to question the woman.

"Yes, my lord, don't be fooled by what is shown in the theaters. If the Church were still here, they would never allow such nonsense on stage. This creature is also a little devil; I am punishing her on behalf of the Church. My lord, strangle her quickly so that the breath of hell does not spread to Longsong Town!"

"Get to the point!" he rebuked.

After the woman rambled on, Petro finally managed to understand the whole story. It turned out that after the church was burned down by Timothy, she and some other believers spontaneously organized to continue preaching and praying in the outer city area, waiting for Hermes Holy City to send a new priest to rebuild the Western Region Church. The incident this time was purely coincidental; the girl was seen using her abilities to remove snow from the roofs of the residents' houses, which led to the scene witnessed earlier.

In her narrative, the woman also repeatedly complained about the absurdity of the content taught by primary education and the theater’s performances that distort right and wrong, to the point that the onlookers only dared to catch the boy, but very few were willing to help her strangle this despicable devil. If it were in the past, her body would have already been hanging under the eaves... Petro listened to these hate-filled words with twitching brows.

"Take her back for a thorough interrogation," he ordered the knight, "you stay in the fortress this time. When I return, I want to see all the believers related to her already locked up in the cells."

"What... No! My lord, how can you—" The woman's protest was cut short as the knight slapped her back into silence.



"Are you really a witch?" Petro then looked towards the little girl with a face full of terror, "Show me."



The latter weakly knelt on the ground, without any reaction.



Petro shook his head, raising his voice he repeated, "If you can prove that you are a real witch, I will let you leave."



After a long while, the girl timidly stretched her hands into the snow. Soon, the snow nearly a palm thick gradually turned into flowing meltwater.



"I see," Petro nodded, "Come with me."



"Go?" The other party lifted her head, "Where?"



"A place suitable for witches to live." He signaled the servants to pick up the girl and continued towards the dock.



"Put her down, you liar! You promised to let her leave!" The boy tried to rush over but was stopped by several other servants, his shouting gradually fading away behind them.
