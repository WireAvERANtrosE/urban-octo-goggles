## Evelyn's Determination
Roland was startled by the words "We don't have much time," and only after clarifying did he let out a sigh of relief. "Could you please not stop halfway through your sentences? It's really unsettling."



"Do you think five years is a long time?" Agatha frowned. "This pattern held true for both the first and second Battle of Divine Will, but now, for some reason, it's getting shorter, and... it might even become shorter still."



"I actually thought you were going to say that the Bloody Moon would descend this winter," Roland shrugged. According to the current pace of research and development, he would be able to equip the entire army with new firearms within a year. As long as the enemy wasn't impervious to bullets and blades, they stood a chance of winning the war. The only thing that needed attention was that the development of his territory had to reach a level where it could sustain a protracted war. This required the land, population, and resources to all meet a higher standard, with enough strategic depth to allow for a temporary retreat in the event of a defeat, preserving their fighting force.



Therefore, the difficulty wasn't in the weapons, but in the need to build two or three industrial cities to provide a continuous supply of people, munitions, and food for the war. Logistics ensured victory, and personnel ensured logistics. In conclusion, he found that what he lacked the most was a reliable leadership team, including managers and clerks. Without these, even if he unified Greycastle, he couldn't integrate it into a complete war machine, and those nobles might even hold him back.



Indeed, it was true that countries capable of warfare were those with a higher degree of education.



"What is this weapon called?" Agatha suddenly changed the subject. "I remember you called it the 152mm fortress..."



"Standard fortress cannon," Roland added, "and there will be a naval gun version in the future."



"If you can fill the entire city wall with such weapons before the Bloody Moon appears, we might be able to withstand the demons' assault. According to what Celine has told me, those things I'm doing in the chemical laboratory are also parts of the cannons, right?" Agatha seemed determined. "I will do everything in my power to produce liquid nitrogen and liquid oxygen for you, as long as you can—"



"Don't worry," he comforted her, "we will defeat the demons."



"Is that all for today?" Evelyn stretched out her finger to touch the liquor in the vat, tasting it on her tongue, the spiciness seemed to have intensified. According to His Highness's request, the purer the alcohol, the better, and the best liquor could even contain no water at all, every drop pure and aromatic—although she felt her distilled spirits were getting closer to what His Highness described, it seemed to grow further away from the term "delicious."



"Yes, thank you for your hard work," the manager of the distillery affixed a number to the vat and nodded to her, "Please send my regards to His Highness."



"Can these... really sell?" Evelyn wondered, with her experience of running a tavern, she feared few could accept such a spicy flavor.



"That, I do not know," the other person laughed, "But every once in a while, someone comes to take a batch away, so I think there must be people who like it."



Evelyn breathed a sigh of relief. If no one wanted to drink this, not only would His Highness face failure, but she would also lose her value... Thankfully, it wasn't as she feared. It seemed His Highness, true to his noble birth, really had a grasp on the tastes of the nobility. She smiled, "Then I'll take my leave."



Leaving the distillery, Evelyn walked through the bitterly cold streets back to the castle, where the warm air immediately enveloped her. Inside and outside the house were like two different worlds; she took a deep breath, removed her coat, and let the warmth get closer.



Such comfortable living was unimaginable in the past—during winter, one had to either huddle around a brazier with family or curl up under the blankets. The scenes inside the castle, how were they any different from the divine kingdom that the Church claimed had spring all year round? Moreover, His Highness said he wanted to extend the heating system to the common residential areas, to keep the subjects away from the harsh cold of the Evil Months. She didn't know how many of the Church's believers had reached the divine kingdom, but here, the witches—labeled as the devil's minions—and ordinary civilians had taken the lead in experiencing these comforts. If those believers knew, they would probably be green with envy.



His Royal Highness, the Prince, truly is a man who can do anything.



Passing through the hall, Andrea, Ashes, and Sylvie were playing poker.

"A pair of eights!"

"I can't follow."

"A pair of twos! I win," Andrea said with a proud smile, "Ashes still has six cards left, the most of anyone. Hand over the ice cream IOU!" Then she turned her head and beckoned to Evelyn, "Hey, want to join us?"

Evelyn couldn't help but ask curiously, "What's an ice cream IOU?"

"It's part of the bet," the other replied with a wave of her hand, "Whoever has the most IOUs at the end has to give up their next ice cream bread to the winner. So, how about it, want to give it a try?"

Evelyn hesitated. It was a rare opportunity to engage with the battle witches; on Sleeping Island, both Andrea and Ashes were figures second only to Lady Tilly, and it was rare to even see them, let alone be actively invited to join their activities. Plus, playing landlord was indeed interesting; the rules were simple but full of changes, and it required cooperation with teammates, easily entertaining one for the entire day. However…

"Uh, the final tests are coming up soon, aren't you planning to review a bit?"

"Do you mean the basic course assessment tonight?" Andrea pursed her lips, "It's all pretty simple stuff. You can answer it without reading the books, right?"



The other two nodded in agreement.

That's right... Andrea is a noble, after all, her insights have always been a notch above the rest, and both Ashes and Sylvie can read and write. It seemed that she was actually the one lagging behind.

"I... I think I'll stop playing," she hesitated for a moment, "You guys continue, I'm going back to my room to read."

Leaving the slightly surprised trio behind, Evelyn hurried back to the Witch Building. She pushed open the wooden door of her dwelling to find Candle sitting at the table in the living room, practicing arithmetic problems from the textbook.

"You're back?"

"Yeah," seeing Candle focused on practicing, she suddenly felt much more at ease, "How's the revision going?"

"Not bad, the natural sciences and arithmetic parts are a bit difficult to understand," Candle smiled, "What about you?"

"Same here," Evelyn nodded, "Let's gather the parts we don't understand and ask Miss Anna for help tonight."

"Sounds good."



Evelyn thought to herself, as she heard from Teacher Scroll that all these books were written by Prince Roland himself, they were also a part of the knowledge in his mind. If she could master them, she could also possess a part of his omnipotence, right? Compared to abilities that were determined at birth, at least she could make progress in this area through hard work. Even if the nobles no longer fancied drinking the spicy white liquor, she could still serve as a teacher in her own domain, rather than being utterly useless. For this reason, she would open her textbooks whenever she had time, chewing over the arcane vocabulary and formulas, frequenting the places like Anna's, Scroll's, and Wendy's rooms.



Last time, she had scored the lowest in the exam, but this time, she firmly believed it would not be the same.



So, she set a modest goal for herself—to surpass Maggie! She told herself.
