## Leaf
Seeing the busy people around her, Leaf had never expected that she would have a day close to a worldly town. 

After entering the territory of Border Town, those low brick-and-mud bungalows appeared in front of her, like memories long sealed in dust. It had been less than half a year since she fled to the Impassable Mountain Range, yet she felt the scene before her eyes was as strange as another world.

The Evil Months had just passed, and after a winter of scant clothing and food, the townsfolk should have looked and felt terrible. Leaf remembered that the Mutual Aid Society had once passed through the slums of Silver City during winter—bodies that had starved or frozen to death were everywhere, and those who were still alive moved like zombies, numb and sluggish.

But here, the people she saw were mostly full of energy; some were drying fish at their doorsteps; others were climbing onto rooftops to repair broken tiles; and many more were strapping young men carrying hoes and hammers, laughing and talking as they headed north of the town. In such situations, Leaf would lower her hat brim and avoid them as much as possible.

The castle was conspicuously located on a high hill in the southwest corner of the town. There weren't many plants around that could be used, so sneaking in silently was very difficult. Hiding inside a tree trunk to evade enemies was one thing, but having a tree climb up and send her inside would make too much noise.

She wasn't a witch adept at hiding her figure, and after much consideration, Leaf thought it was better to walk into the castle openly rather than skulking around.

If Nightingale hadn't lied to her, there shouldn't be any problems even if she entered through the main gate.

If Nightingale had deceived her and her sisters of the Mutual Aid Society, she was confident that she could escape from the pursuit of the two guards at the gate.

Of course, the worst-case scenario would be if Nightingale had completely betrayed everyone, relying on hunting witches to serve the prince. In that case, it was very likely that she would die here. As a top combat witch, few could escape Nightingale's pursuit, not even someone as strong as Cara could be sure of victory.



Leaf had already prepared for the worst. If she did not make it back alive, Scroll would take over as the teacher and lead the sisters onwards—As for where their destination lay, or what their final fate would be, no one knew the answer.



She slowly walked up the slope toward the castle gate. The guards quickly noticed her, their hands on the hilts of their swords, and shouted, "This is the Prince's residence, not a place for you. Step back!" He paused, then added, "If you have an urgent matter to report, go left along this road to the City Hall. Someone there will attend to you."



Leaf took a deep breath and removed her hood. As expected, she saw both men's expressions change to surprise. Without waiting for them to recover, she stated bluntly, "I am a witch."



The moment the words were spoken, she was almost ready for the guards to draw their swords. But the two guards just exchanged glances, showing none of the usual undisguised loathing that people felt upon hearing the word "witch." One of them even asked with curiosity, "Witch, what business do you have?"



This reaction made Leaf's heart rate surge. She suppressed the excitement almost boiling over and said as calmly as possible, "I wish to see Nightingale. Or Anna and Nana would also do."



In Nightingale's stories, witches were regular visitors to the castle, and His Highness the Prince did not restrict their freedom. The royal guards, under the Fourth Prince's direction, turned a blind eye to their comings and goings... If what Nightingale said was true, then the guards would certainly have heard their names.



The guard who had spoken patted his partner's shoulder, "You keep an eye on her here; I'll go inform His Highness."



Leaf watched as he entered the gate and quickly disappeared into the garden.



What awaited her? A welcome from her sisters, a siege by the guards, or a blade from the shadows?



She found herself caught in a strange contradiction; she wanted to believe in Nightingale, but the closer she got to the answer, the more she feared disappointment. Could it be that Nightingale had changed her appearance and was not known by that name here? Could Anna and Nana be figments of her imagination? Or maybe...

Time had never felt as slow as it did at this moment! Each heartbeat seemed to span a hundred years, and in the lengthy passage of time, she quietly awaited her fate.

After what felt like an eternity, or perhaps just a brief moment, she heard Nightingale's voice—she thought she had heard wrong in a trance.

A familiar figure appeared from behind the door and lunged at her, almost arriving at the same time as the voice. Then, she was enveloped in a warm embrace.

"Leaf, welcome home!"

...

"These are some spare clothes of mine, you can wear them for now," Nightingale was rummaging through the wardrobe, "Also, a coat, shoes... hmm, I should grab a set of nightgowns and towels as well."

"What's the rush?" Wendy said with a smile, shaking her head, "Once His Highness gets up, he will naturally take care of her arrangements."

Watching Nightingale bustling about, Leaf's eyes grew warm again. She sniffled, bit her lip, and wiped away the tears that threatened to spill. She was afraid that once she started speaking, she wouldn't be able to keep the tears at bay.



Nightingale had not deceived herself after all; the prince who was willing to treat witches kindly really did exist.



"Why don't you take a hot bath first? You must be exhausted from traveling from the camp," Nightingale placed the towel and clothes beside Leaf, "His Highness is napping right now, he will be very happy to see you when he wakes up. By the way, did you find the Holy Mountain? How are the other sisters doing?"



As soon as she asked this question, Leaf's vision became blurred, and she could no longer hold back. She embraced Nightingale, releasing all the suppressed pain in her heart.



Leaf cried until Nightingale's chest was completely wet, and then she gradually calmed down.



Then she recounted everything that had happened to the sisters after the three of them had left the Witch Cooperation Association. When she talked about the many sisters who had perished in the barren lands, she felt Nightingale's hand involuntarily tighten around her own.



After Leaf finished speaking, Wendy's expression became extremely grave, "I never imagined that Cara would lead the Witch Cooperation Association to a dead end. Out of forty-two sisters, only seven are left... I also bear inescapable responsibility. If only I had firmly stood with Nightingale at that time..."



"It's not your fault," Nightingale said sadly, "No one can predict the future; the key is what to do next." She looked at Leaf, "You said there are six sisters who survived; where are they?"



"They are all waiting at the entrance of the canyon for my message. We had an agreement that if I couldn't return, Scroll would lead them away from this place, perhaps to the Far South or maybe across the strait..."



"Then we must hurry and bring them back," Nightingale immediately said, "I will set out right now, Wendy, please take care of Leaf."



"Wait, what if they don't believe you? Leaf should also go, and call Lightning too—she should be practicing flying at the west end of the town right now. You guys should take a few more horses, so the sisters can walk less," Wendy carefully instructed.



"But isn't His Highness the prince still sleeping?" Leaf was taken aback. "Don't you need to ask him?"



"Don't worry," Nightingale whispered reassuringly, "If His Highness knew about this, he would probably be too happy to care."
