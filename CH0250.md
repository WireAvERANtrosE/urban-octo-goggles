## Late Summer
Seeing that Midsummer Day was about to end, and Border Town was soon to welcome the last and hottest month of summer, Roland increasingly did not want to leave the castle.



The saltpeter purchased from Margaret was used not only for making gunpowder but also to lower room temperatures—now almost every room had a bucket filled with saltpeter, with a water jug soaked inside. This not only had the effect of absorbing heat to cool down the room but also allowed for drinking ice water to quench one's thirst. Only by doing so, could he avoid sweating profusely as soon as he sat down in the office every day.



Apart from Anna, the other witches had also been asked to stop working, except for their daily necessary practice and studies. They were mostly gathered in the great hall on the first floor, either chatting leisurely or competing against each other in games of Quint card, all in a harmonious and joyful atmosphere. As for Anna... it was not that Roland did not want her to rest, but she simply did not mind the heat. She could directly handle glowing-hot iron ingots, so the high temperatures of the scorching summer days were nothing to her. Even if she stood by the steelmaking furnace and busied herself all afternoon, she would not shed a single drop of sweat.



To reward the diligent and conscientious Anna, Roland would recently go out of his way to make some frozen desserts for her, such as the classic delicacy of the later generations—ice cream—made by mixing egg yolks, cream, milk, and sugar water evenly, then cooling it with saltpeter. Anna was very fond of this kind of snack that was cold, soft, and sweet. Every time she took small bites of the ice cream, her lake-blue eyes narrowing into a seam, it was a pleasing and delightful sight for him.



Besides that, reviewing the various monthly summary reports sent from the City Hall was also a pleasant pastime.



Up to now, the population of Border Town had doubled again, approaching eighteen thousand people. With the monthly "tribute" of serfs from Longsong Stronghold, it would not be a problem to break through the twenty-thousand mark by next year. Without including the population of the villages and towns within the territory, this scale could almost compare with large cities such as Redwater City, Valencia, and the King's City.



The slight regret was that although the population had increased significantly, the quality had not improved much. Currently, only the thousand or so original residents of the town were receiving education, and it would likely take about a year for them to graduate smoothly—although the private academy previously established by Karl had produced a batch of graduates, the number of less than a hundred was still negligible compared to the total population.



Perhaps it would be better to start educating the refugees from the Eastern Region, rather than waiting until enough residential complexes had been built to take this step, Roland thought to himself. After all, the sooner the education began, the better, with no downsides.



The development of the town's factories was also very promising.



After more than half a year of construction, the industrial zone now has three factories in operation: two steam engine production plants and one bullet processing plant. The number of workers in Factory No. 1 has expanded from a dozen blacksmiths when it was first established to over a hundred now, with most of the newcomers being indigenous people—this is precisely what he had hoped to see: a group of apprentices gradually becoming craftsmen and then driving the next group of apprentices.



The workers of Factory No. 2 belong to the Crescent Moon Bay caravan. In just one month, they roughly mastered the use of various machine tools, although the yield of good products was rather poor. However, compared to the blacksmiths of Factory No. 1, the performance of these craftsmen in their first month was obviously much better. It's just that before the contract expires, the steam engines they produce are owned by Roland. Now, the two factories can produce about eight to ten steam engines each month, which is also the main income of Border Town.



As for the bullet factory, it was handed over to the First Army after its completion. Not only is there a sentry post at the entrance, patrols are arranged around the perimeter, and even the production work is handled by soldiers. After a week of trial operation, it has now begun mass production of the new generation of fixed-load bullets.



The assembly line designed by Roland could not achieve full mechanical production. Whether it's primers, gunpowder, or bullets, they all require manual loading and pressing. The main processing tools are two mechanical punching machines: one can press the copper sheets cut by Anna into the shape of bullet casings, and the other is used to punch primer cups.



The soldiers only need to evenly place the mercury fulminate powder between two thin sheets of paper, seal the paper, insert it into the primer cup, and finally push the primer cup into the annular groove at the end of the bullet casing, and then their task is complete. As for the processes of loading black powder and pressing the bullets, they are the same as the previous reloading exercises.



The factory doesn't employ many people, only about forty, but nearly five hundred bullets can be produced each day. Roland plans to turn these forty or so people into full-time processing personnel to maintain the normal operation of the bullet factory.



Next, Roland plans to add a soap factory and a perfume factory—the former is an extremely important part of the military industry, while the latter may open up a new trade channel for the town. As for the bicycle factory, it can be delayed a little longer, as long as it starts production before the completion of the Kingdom Main Street.



"Your Highness," Nightingale said as she pushed open the door, "Maggie and Lightning are here."



The two squeezed past Nightingale and ran up to the desk, poking their heads out, "Did you need us for something?"



"Tomorrow will be the beginning of summer," Roland took out the reply that he had already written from the drawer and handed it to Maggie, "When you return to the Fjords, remember to pass this on to Tilly."

"Ah...!" She paused for a moment, blinked a few times before taking the envelope, and carefully tucked it into her close-fitting bag, "No problem, coo!"

Seeing her suddenly enlightened expression, Roland suppressed the amusement in his heart, realizing that the charm of the town must indeed be quite substantial.

"I completely forgot that tomorrow is the start of a new month," Lightning said, pressing her forehead, "Doesn't that mean there will be a long time before we can meet again?"

"It was Lady Tilly's cleaning plan that delayed things last time, I will come back as soon as possible this time," Maggie fluffed her long white hair that almost touched the ground, "And the Eagle's Nest has to wait for me to come back before allowing any exploration... coo!"

"I get it," the young girl pouted, "It's settled then."

"You have a mission too," Roland spread out a map of the southern region of the town, "This is the map you drew yourself, do you remember the location of the shoal by the mountain close to the sea?"

"I remember," Lightning pointed on the map, "It should be around this spot."

"Good, you'll take Maggie with you for a flyover later, then plant two flags at the junction of the shoal and the mountain, and mark it on the map," he finished his instructions and looked at Maggie, "If Tilly agrees to send the witches, you will guide the sailboat to this shoal, and I will welcome your arrival at the mountain top."



"Send out a witch?" Lightning asked curiously. "Does that mean a new sister is coming to Border Town?"



"Not sure yet," Roland replied with a slight smile. "It will depend on Tilly's response... but I think she will agree."
