## End of Midsummer
Seeing that Midsummer Day was about to end, Border Town was about to welcome the last and hottest month of summer, and Roland increasingly did not want to leave the castle.



The saltpeter bought from Margie was used not only for making gunpowder but also to lower the room temperature—now almost every room had a bucket filled with saltpeter, with a kettle soaked in it. This setup could absorb heat to cool down the room and provide ice water to quench thirst. Only in this way could he avoid sweating profusely just after sitting down in his office.



Apart from Anna, the other witches had also been told to stop their work. Aside from the necessary daily practice and learning, they basically gathered in the first-floor hall, either chatting or playing Gwent cards with each other, looking harmonious and happy. As for Anna... it wasn't that Roland didn't want her to rest, but that she simply wasn't bothered by the heat. She could directly handle red-hot iron ingots, so the high temperatures of summer were nothing to her. Even if she stood beside the steel furnace and worked all afternoon, she would not sweat a drop.



To reward the diligent and serious Anna, Roland had recently been making special frozen desserts for her, such as the classic delicacy of ice cream from later ages—made by mixing and stirring egg yolks, cream, milk, and sugar water evenly, then cooling it with saltpeter. Anna was very fond of this kind of snack with a cold, smooth, and sweet taste. Every time she nibbled on the ice cream with her lake-blue eyes curved into a slit, he found it a delightful sight.



Furthermore, going through the various end-of-month summary reports sent from the town hall was also a great pleasure.



Up to now, the population of Border Town had doubled again and was close to eighteen thousand people. With the monthly "surrender" of serfs from Longsong Stronghold, breaking through the twenty thousand mark next year would not be a problem. Not counting the population of villages and towns within the territory, this size could roughly compete with big cities like Redwater City, Golden Wheat City, and the King's City of Graycastle.



The slight regret was that although the population had grown considerably, the quality had not improved much. The ones currently receiving education were still the thousand or so original residents of the town, and it was likely to take about a year for them to graduate successfully—Karl's private academy had produced a batch of graduates, but the number of less than a hundred was still negligible compared to the total population.



Perhaps it would be better to start educating the refugees from the Eastern Region instead of waiting until enough dormitory complexes were built, Roland thought to himself. After all, starting education early only had benefits, not drawbacks.



The development of the town's factories was also very promising.



After more than half a year of construction, the industrial zone now has three factories in operation: two steam engine production plants and one bullet processing plant. The number of workers in Plant No. 1 has expanded from a dozen smiths at its establishment to over a hundred people now, with the newcomers being mostly indigenous people—this is exactly what he hoped to see, a group of apprentices gradually growing into craftsmen and then leading the next batch of apprentices.



The workers in Plant No. 2 belong to the Crescent Moon Bay caravan. Within just a month, they had roughly mastered the use of various machine tools, and even though the rate of good products was rather poor, their performance in the first month was clearly more outstanding compared to the blacksmiths of Plant No. 1. However, until their contract expires, all the steam engines they produce belong to Roland. Now, the two factories can produce about eight to ten steam engines each month, which is the main source of income for Border Town.



As for the bullet factory, it was handed over to the First Army right after completion. Not only is there a sentry at the entrance, but patrols are also arranged around the perimeter, and even the production work is undertaken by soldiers. After a week of trial operation, it has now begun mass production of the new generation of fixed ammunition.



The assembly line designed by Roland couldn't achieve full mechanical production; whether it's the primer, gunpowder, or the bullet itself, all require manual loading and pressing. The main processing tools are two mechanical stamping machines: one can press the copper pieces cut by Anna into the shape of cartridge cases, and the other is used to stamp primer cups.



The soldiers just need to evenly place the mercury fulminate powder between two thin sheets of paper, seal the paper, insert it into the primer cup, and then press the primer cup into the annular groove at the end of the cartridge case, and the job is done. As for the process of loading black powder and pressing the bullets, it is exactly the same as the previous reloading drills.



There are not many people in the factory, only about forty, and they can produce more than five hundred bullets every day. Roland plans to turn these forty or so people into full-time processing personnel to maintain the normal operation of the bullet factory.



Next, Roland plans to add soap and perfume factories—the former is an extremely important part of the military industry, while the latter might open up a new trade channel for the town. As for the bicycle factory, it can be postponed a bit longer, as long as it starts production before the Kingdom Main Street is completed.



"Your Highness," Nightingale pushed open the door and said, "Maggie and Lightning have arrived."



The two squeezed past Nightingale's side and ran to the table, poking their heads out, "Did you need us for something?"



"Tomorrow is the beginning of the Month of Demons," Roland took out the reply letter he had already written from the drawer and handed it to Maggie, "When you return to the Fjords, remember to pass this on to Tilly."

"Ah...!" She was stunned for a moment, blinked a few times before taking the envelope, and carefully stuffed it into the pouch close to her body, "No problem, coo!"

Seeing her suddenly enlightened expression, Roland barely suppressed a laugh. It seemed that the charm of the town was indeed quite substantial.

"I had forgotten that tomorrow marks the start of a new month," Lightning pressed her forehead, "Doesn't that mean we won't be able to meet for a long time again?"

"It was Lady Tilly's cleaning plan that delayed things last time. I'll come back as soon as possible this time," Maggie shook her white hair that almost touched the ground, "The Eyrie has to wait for me to return before going on an adventure... coo!"

"I get it already," the little girl pouted, "Let's settle on that."

"You have a mission too," Roland spread out a map of the southern region of the town, "This is the map you drew yourself. Do you remember the location of the shallows near the mountains by the sea?"

"I remember," Lightning pointed at the map, "It's roughly around here."

"Good, you'll take Maggie and fly over there later, then plant two flags where the shallows meet the mountains, and mark it on the map," he finished his instructions and looked at Maggie, "If Tilly agrees to send the witches, then lead the sailboat to this area of the shallows. I will be waiting at the mountain peak to welcome your arrival."



"Send a witch?" Lightning asked curiously, "Is there a new sister coming to Border Town?"



"Not sure yet," Roland said with a slight smile, "that will depend on Tilly's response... But I think she will agree."
