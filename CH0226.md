## City Operation
"Did you get the Holy Medicine?" Black Hammer immediately perked up.



"Holy Medicine?" Tassa put away his smile and let out a cold laugh, "There's no need for the church's medicine to cure those infected by the demonic plague." He took two small leather pouches from his waist and placed them on the table, "Blaming the witches is just their usual trick; after all, the dead can't refute them."



Black Hammer picked up one of the pouches, shook it by his ear a few times, then untied the string and sniffed it, "It doesn't smell?"



"Give it to Silver Ring and Pottery Jar to drink, then you'll know if it's real medicine," Tassa said, "They should still be in the tavern, right?"



"Ever since they were found to be infected, I've had them hide in the cellar and not come out. Right now, people with the demonic plague are easily attacked by the townspeople, and the Skeleton Finger's den won't open its doors to let them in." Black Hammer picked up the cloth bag, "My lord, I'll go and try it right away."



After he left, Hill remained staring at the table, silent, prompting Tassa to shake his head inwardly.



An ordinary person living under the scourge of the demonic plague, upon hearing that there was a medicine that could treat the epidemic, should not be so calm. Even if one wouldn't get excited enough to snatch it and take a look, at least one would ask a few more questions. As intelligence personnel, this performance was hardly satisfactory.



"Can this medicine really cure the demonic plague?" Little Finger clamored, "My lord, where did you get it from?"



Even the little girl was more on the ball than Hill, Tassa drank a glass of wine, "Of course, it was given to me by that lord in the palace, who else would dare to go against the church?"



Before long, Black Hammer returned with the silver ring and the clay pot, "My God, this medicine is incredible! They had barely taken it before the black spots on their bodies started to vanish."



"Sir, thank you for your potion," the two of them knelt down with a thud, while the blood was still seeping from the cracked skin of the clay pot carrier, "You have saved our lives!"



"First, bandage your wounds," Tassa waved his hand, the purifying water could expel the epidemic but could not heal wounds. For those who were seriously injured to recover as before, it would take at least about a week's time, "Rather than thanking me, you should thank my employer. If this task is done well, you might even have the chance to shake off your status as rats."



"Your... No, I mean, does your employer really intend to let us sell the potion?" Black Hammer asked excitedly. Clearly, he also realized how much income selling a special potion at this time could bring.



"Yes, the church uses this method to deceive the citizens which enraged him greatly. If we let those charlatans continue their recklessness, I'm afraid the entire King's City will turn into a huge cathedral rather than the Wimbledon family's territory," Tassa said gravely, "Moreover, he does not wish to see such a large city with few living souls, so the potion absolutely cannot be sold at a high price. It must be affordable for most commoners." He took out two leather pouches and tossed them on the table, "Like this one, it can be sold for no more than ten Silver Royals."



"Ten... ten Silver Royals!?" Black Hammer's eyes widened.



"That's right, six for my employer and the rest is yours," he opened his palm, "And there's enough potion for about five to six thousand people, so you'll earn at least several hundred Gold Royals. Even if it's divided equally, that's no small sum, enough for you to spend for a lifetime."



The other party seemed hesitant, his eyes fixed on the leather pouches on the table, as if considering how to gain greater benefits from it.



Tassa was well aware of the thoughts running through the minds of these rats.



The potion itself has no cost, so giving it away for free is not a problem. But with such a large quantity, relying on one person to distribute it is not only inefficient but also too conspicuous. Giving it to Rat to sell reduces the risk, and ten silver royals is a price most townsfolk can afford. Of course, these people are unlikely to sell it honestly at a low price. Whether they hide some to sell in the Inner City or turn to sell it on the black market, they stand to make a huge profit.



In the end, perhaps less than half of these potions will be sold at a low price to the civilians, but that is not Tassa's main concern. His task from Prince Roland is to thwart the Church's conspiracy as much as possible. As long as everyone understands that the Holy Water of Healing is not the only remedy against the demonic plague and is not some rare, expensive item, the claims made by the priests will be questioned by the public. Especially those believers who spent a great deal to obtain the Holy Water will start to doubt whether the spokespeople of the gods are deceiving them.



"I know what you are thinking," Tassa spoke up, "Hiding some to sell yourself or prioritizing buyers who offer more, I can pretend not to see... But don't forget," his tone turned cold, "my employer is not a benevolent person. If you don't want to end up at the bottom of the moat, it's best to restrain yourselves. After all, you can only enjoy if you are alive."



"What if someone else resells it?" Silver Ring asked.



"That's simple. Each person can only buy one bag and must use it on the spot," he said and then looked towards Black Hammer, "How about it, are you interested in taking on this business?"



"Relying on the underground messengers alone might not be enough to distribute so many potions, I think..."



Tassa cut him off directly, "Who to sell to and where to sell, that's your business. I am only here to keep an eye on you for the lord."



Black Hammer gritted his teeth, looked around at the four people, saw no objections, and then slammed his fist on the table, "I'm in for this business!"



"Good," he nodded, "The day after tomorrow, when the sun sets, the carriage loaded with potions will arrive at the entrance of the tavern. Arrange your people and spread the news about the new medicine. Do well, my employer does not want to see failure."



The day after tomorrow is also the last day that the First Army will stay. After that, no matter what happens in the city, it will no longer pose a threat to His Highness, thought Tassa.

...

Not long after leaving the tavern, Hill caught up from behind.

"Aren't you going to meet my companions? They are all eager to take revenge on Timothy."

"I temporarily trust you because you passed the test, but that doesn't mean I trust them," Tassa shook his head. "If you hadn't been caught today, what would you have planned to do?"

"I was going to go back and tell everyone the news, hear their opinions, and decide whether to continue observing for a while or to directly side with Prince Roland," he answered.

"Oh?" Tassa asked with interest, "And what is your personal opinion?"

Hill hesitated before speaking, "I think His Highness is different from most nobles. There are very few who would go to such lengths to save refugees, and moreover... he treats witches equally. If Timothy had done the same, my wife would not have..." He paused for a moment, "Therefore, I am more inclined to serve His Highness directly."

"Then go back now and say nothing, as if you had never been to the docks."



"Why..." He looked up in surprise.



"A good intelligence agent should be accustomed to keeping secrets to themselves, instead of sharing with others, especially at critical moments like these," Tassa said word by word. "If you wish to serve His Highness, there is much you still need to learn."
