## Movements within the City
"Did you get the God's Punishment Potion?" Blackhammer suddenly perked up.



"God's Punishment Potion?" Theo put away his smile and sneered, "We don't need the Church's medicine to cure patients infected with the demonic plague." He took off two small leather pouches from his waist and placed them on the table. "Blaming the witches is just their usual trick, dead men tell no tales anyway."



Blackhammer picked up one of the pouches with a puzzled look, shook it next to his ear, then untied the string and sniffed, "No smell?"



"Give it to Silver Ring and Pottery Jar to drink, and you'll find out whether it's real medicine or not," Theo said. "They should still be in the tavern, right?"



"Ever since they were found to be infected, I've had them hide in the cellar and not come out. Now, people with the plague spots are easily attacked by the townspeople, and the Skeleton Finger's lair won't open its doors to let them in." Blackhammer picked up the cloth bag, "My lord, I'll go try it out right away."



After he left, Hill remained staring at the table, silent, which made Theo shake his head inwardly.



An ordinary person living under the scourge of the demonic plague, upon hearing there was a medicine that could treat the disease, shouldn't be so calm. Even if he wasn't excited enough to snatch it up for a look, he should at least ask a few more questions. As an intelligence officer, this behavior was really not up to par.



"Can this medicine really cure the demonic plague?" Littlefinger clamored, "My lord, where did you get this?"



Even the little girl was more on the ball than he was, Theo drank a cup of wine, "Of course, it was given to me by that lord in the palace, who else would dare to go against the Church?"



Before long, Iron Axe returned with the silver ring and the earthen jar, "My god, this medicine is simply incredible! Not long after they drank it, the black spots on their bodies visibly disappeared."

"Sir, thank you for your potion," the two knelt on the ground with a thud, the cracked skin of the earthen jar still oozing blood, "You saved our lives!"

"First, bandage the wounds," Theo waved his hand, the Purification Water could remove the plague, but it could not heal wounds. For the seriously injured to fully recover, they would need at least about a week's time, "Rather than thanking me, you should thank my employer. If this mission goes well, you might even have the chance to rid yourselves of the identity of rats."

"Sire... No, I mean, does your employer really intend to let us sell the medicine?" Iron Axe asked excitedly. Clearly, he also realized that selling this kind of special potion at such a time could bring in a substantial income.

"That's right, the Church using this method to deceive the townspeople has made him extremely angry. If we let these charlatans continue unchecked, I'm afraid the entire King's City will become a grand cathedral, rather than the Wimbledon family's territory," Theo said gravely, "Moreover, he does not wish to see such a large city with so few living people, so the potion must not be sold at a high price. It needs to be affordable for most commoners." He then took out two leather pouches and threw them on the table, "Like this one bag, it can only be sold for up to ten Silver Royals."

"Te... Ten Silver Royals?!" Iron Axe's eyes widened.

"That's right, six go to my employer, and the rest are yours," he opened his palm and said, "And there's enough potion for five or six thousand people, so you'll earn at least several hundred Gold Royals. Even if it's split evenly, it's not a small amount, enough for you to spend for a lifetime."

The other party appeared hesitant, eyes fixed on the leather pouches on the table, seemingly considering how to extract greater benefit from them.

Theo was very clear about the thoughts of these rats.



The potion itself has no cost, so even giving it away for free wouldn't be a problem. However, distributing such a large quantity by himself would not only be inefficient but also too conspicuous. Leaving the sale to the Rats could reduce the risk, and ten silver royals is a price most of the townsfolk can afford. Of course, these people are not likely to sell it at a low price honestly. Whether they stash some away to sell in the inner city district or turn them over to the black market, they can make a huge profit.



In the end, perhaps less than half of these potions will be sold to commoners at a low price, but that is not Theo's main concern. The task Prince Roland has entrusted to him is to thwart the church's conspiracy as much as possible. As long as everyone realizes that the Holy Water is not the only cure for the demonic plague and is not some rare and expensive item, the clergy's propaganda will be questioned by the public. This is especially true for the believers who have spent a great deal to obtain the Holy Medicine. They will start to doubt from the bottom of their hearts whether the spokespeople of the gods are deceiving them.



"I know what you're thinking," Theo said, "Hiding some away for your own secret sale or giving priority to buyers who offer a higher price, I can turn a blind eye to that... But don't forget," his tone turned cold, "my employer is not a kind person. If you don't want to be sunk to the bottom of the moat, it's best to restrain yourselves. After all, you only have the opportunity to enjoy life if you're alive."



"What if someone else resells it?" Silver Ring asked.



"That's simple, one person can only buy one bag, and must use it on the spot," he replied, then looked at Iron Axe, "How about it, are you interested in taking on this business?"



Iron Axe clenched his teeth and looked around at the four people, seeing no objections, he then smashed his fist on the table, "I'm in for this business!"



"Good," he nodded, "The day after tomorrow, when the sun sets, the carriage loaded with potions will arrive at the entrance of the tavern. Arrange your people and release the news about the new medicine. Do a good job, my employer does not want to see failure."



The day after tomorrow will also be the last day the First Army stays around; no matter what the city turns into, it won't pose a threat to His Highness anymore, Theo thought.

...

Not long after leaving the tavern, Hill caught up from behind.

"Aren't you going to meet my companions? They all long for vengeance against Timothy."

"I temporarily trust you because you passed the test, but that doesn't mean I trust them," Theo shook his head. "If you hadn't been caught today, what would you have planned to do?"

"I intended to go back and share this news with everyone, to hear their opinions on whether to continue observing for a while longer or to directly side with Prince Roland," he replied.

"Oh?" Theo asked with interest. "And what is your personal opinion?"

Hill hesitated before saying, "I think His Highness is different from most nobles; very few would go to such lengths to save refugees, and furthermore... he treats witches equally. If Timothy had done the same, my wife wouldn't have..." He paused briefly, "Therefore, I lean more towards serving His Highness directly."

"Then for now, go back and say nothing at all, as if you've never been to the docks."



"Why..." He lifted his head in surprise.



"An excellent intelligence officer should be accustomed to keeping secrets in their own heart, rather than sharing them with others, especially at such a critical moment," Theo enunciated each word, "If you wish to serve His Highness, there is still much you need to learn."
