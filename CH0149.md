## King's City Merchants (Part 2)
"Do you mainly deal in saltpeter in the capital?" Roland cut to the chase.



"No, Your Highness," Margaret's smile was no longer perfunctory, and her tone carried a touch more warmth, "I deal in many things, from gems to cloth, from inns to taverns. In fact, I didn't trade in saltpeter until a month ago. The original owner of the saltpeter plant lost his pants in my casino and had to mortgage the whole place to me."



Not only trafficking in various goods but also in the service industry... What kind of background did this merchant have? Roland knew that opening a casino in the capital wasn't something that could be achieved with just money. He tapped on the desk, but Nightingale pinched the middle of her fingers—indicating that the other party was carrying a God's Stone of Retaliation, making it impossible to tell if they were lying.



Wait... if it was unobservable, why did she pinch so hard on her right side earlier?

Roland coughed twice, resisting the urge to turn around and ask.



He had heard that some merchants from the Fjords, after settling in the Four Kingdoms, expanded their businesses and eventually accumulated unimaginable wealth. After all, the sea folk were natural-born merchants, adventurous and keenly opportunistic. While some were fleeced after making their fortunes, others managed to secure their footing by currying favor with local influences, forming relatively stable alliances. Could Margaret be one of these wealthy merchants?



With this in mind, Roland decided to be straightforward with his request, "I need a large quantity of saltpeter, the more the better."



"But the Western Region of the kingdom is not considered a hot place, especially the towns near the Impassable Mountain Range. Your Highness, do you really need so much saltpeter?" she asked curiously, "On the outskirts of the capital, I own three saltpeter plants, enough to supply the nobles of a medium-sized city with ice."



Three saltpeter plants! Roland's heart leapt with joy, though his face remained expressionless, "I plan to build a cold storage room in the castle's basement to store some perishable food items. If your price is right, I will take all the saltpeter you have."



"Since you've said as much," she nodded, "I can transport all the saltpeter to Border Town, and I'll only charge you ninety percent of the market price. However..."



"However what?"



"I'm not very interested in Gold royals; they are almost filling up my warehouse. I've heard that you have some very unique products here. If possible, could these be used to replace Gold royals? I would be very happy to reach a trading agreement with you."



"Unique products?" Roland was stunned, as this was the first time he had heard of someone not wanting Gold royals.



"Yes, like the black iron creations that can move on their own," Margaret leaned forward slightly, "Your servant mentioned that this thing only needs to be ignited to boil water and then it possesses amazing power. In fact, it was after hearing this that I decided to come to Border Town in person. Otherwise, selling the saltpeter directly to the nobles in the capital would be more in my interest—The longer the transport distance, the greater the losses I have to bear."



This was truly an unexpected joy, Roland thought. Although he didn't know how Barov's apprentice had managed to get this connection, and how they ended up discussing steam engines, it was clear that this businesswoman from the capital was very interested in it.



He was very aware of how astonishing the profits of industrial products could be, especially with machinery that only he could manufacture. He had been worried that once Border Town stopped selling ore, the money moved from the Duke's estate would eventually run out. But now, an excellent opportunity was presented right in front of him.



"I see," the prince smiled slightly, "The thing you're talking about is called a steam engine. It can convert the steam produced from boiling water into power. The principle is simple, but only Border Town can produce it."



"Does such a thing really exist?"



"Of course," Roland spread his hands and said, "but it is very complicated to manufacture and quite expensive. If you are interested, you can follow me to see the actual machine."

"I would be delighted." She said excitedly as she got up.

...

At the Northern Slope Mine, Margaret's eyes nearly popped out when she saw the steel beast emitting a piercing roar as it slowly pulled the minecart filled with stones out of the mining tunnel.

"Your Highness, this, this... is simply unbelievable," she said with a trembling voice. "I thought your envoy was exaggerating, but it turns out he was far from describing its full capabilities... I'm afraid dozens of people combined would not match up to this... steam engine."

The businesswoman wanted to take a closer look but was stopped by Roland, "A steam engine at work is very dangerous, do not get too close to it. See that white steam being emitted? Just a touch of it can scald your skin."

"Do you only use it for hauling ore?" She had to raise her voice and ask due to the loud noise.

"We have two steam engines in the mine, the first one is responsible for pulling the minecarts, and the second one is for pumping water out of the tunnels," Roland replied. "In fact, from the successful development to today, Border Town has only produced three steam engines, and I must use them where they are most needed. But its applications are actually very wide-ranging. Besides what you see, it can also replace windmills and watermills to grind wheat, and it is not affected by rivers and wind. Any place that requires a large amount of manpower or animal power can make use of it, it can even be installed on ships, driving oars, and allowing vessels to sail fast without wind sails!"

He knew the significance of a ship that could ignore wind power and direction for the people of the Fjords. Sure enough, Margaret looked at Roland with eyes that almost shone, "Name your price, I want to buy it!"



"This one won't do, the mines rely on it to maintain production. You can place an order for several new steam engines first, and we'll settle the accounts once the saltpeter has been delivered."

"How much does it cost...?"

Roland led her to a position farther away from the mine entrance, where the noise of the machinery was finally less piercing. "Five hundred Gold Royals," he said. The price was somewhat exaggerated, nearly equivalent to the annual income of a knight's entire fief. The ore cost of a steam engine was around twenty Gold Royals, and even with smelting fees, labor costs, and installation fees, it would only amount to fifty Gold Royals. But business is, after all, about bargaining.



"Then it's settled! I want to purchase ten steam engines!"



"..." Roland was stunned for a moment—ten engines equaled five thousand gold coins! That was almost equivalent to the savings of Duke Lion over five or six years. Without even bargaining, is this how the big families conduct business? He cleared his throat, "Are you sure? This isn't a small expense. Moreover, engines can't just be used indefinitely after purchase; you need to continuously invest money to maintain them."



"I know, it's just like with ships that need to enter the dockyard for annual maintenance to clean the keel from parasites and algae, replace sails and ropes, and the like," Margaret said carelessly, "Whatever needs replacing or adding, I can just pay for it and purchase from you. If that doesn't work, you can make another offer, including the craftsmen who maintain and operate the machines in the sale."



Roland closed his mouth, with only one thought in his mind: it's good to be wealthy.
