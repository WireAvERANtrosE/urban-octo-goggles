## King's City Merchants (Part 2)
"Do you mainly deal in saltpeter in the royal capital?" Roland cut to the chase.

"No, Your Highness," Margaret's smile was no longer perfunctory, her tone became more cordial, "I deal in a variety of things, from jewels to fabrics, from inns to taverns. In fact, I only started trading in saltpeter a month ago. The original owner of the saltpeter field lost everything down to his last penny in my casino and had to mortgage the whole place to me."

Not only trading various goods but also being involved in the service industry... What's the background of this merchant? After all, running a casino in the royal capital isn't something you can do just by having money. He tapped the table, while Nightingale pinched in the middle—this meant that the other party was carrying a Divine Stone of Judgement, making it impossible to tell if they were lying.

Wait... Since it's unobservable, why did she pinch so hard on my right side earlier?

Roland coughed twice, suppressing the impulse to turn around and ask.

He had heard that some merchants from the Fjords settled in the four major kingdoms had expanded their businesses and accumulated unimaginable wealth. After all, the sea folks were born merchants, with a natural spirit of adventure and a keen nose for business opportunities. Many were fleeced after making their fortunes, while others stabilized their positions, bought local connections, and formed relatively stable alliances of interest. Could Margaret be one of those successful big players?

With that in mind, Roland decided to make his request straightforwardly, "I need a large amount of saltpeter, the more the better."

"But the western region of the kingdom is not a particularly hot place, especially the towns near the Impassable Mountain Range. Your Highness, do you really need that much saltpeter?" she asked curiously, "On the outskirts of the royal capital, I own three saltpeter fields, enough to supply the nobility of a medium-sized city with ice."

Three saltpeter fields! Roland was overjoyed, but his expression remained unchanged, "I plan to build a cold storage room in the castle's cellar to store some perishable food. If your price is right, I'll take all that saltpeter."

"Since you've said as much," she nodded, "I can transport all the saltpeter to Border Town and only charge you ninety percent of the market price. However..."
"However what?"
"I'm not too keen on Gold royals; they are nearly filling up my warehouse. I've heard that you have some very unique products here, and if possible, I would like to use these in place of Gold royals. I'd be very happy to reach a trade agreement with you."
"Unique products?" Roland was taken aback; it was the first time he had heard of someone not wanting Gold royals.
"Yes, like the black iron contraptions that move on their own," Margaret leaned slightly forward, "Your servant mentioned that this device only needs to be lit to boil water, and then it possesses astonishing power. In fact, it was after hearing about this that I decided to make the trip to Border Town myself; otherwise, selling the saltpeter directly to the nobles in the capital would be more in my interest—the greater the distance I have to transport it, the greater my losses."
This was indeed an unexpected pleasure, Roland thought. Although he didn't know how Barov's apprentice had managed to make this connection, and how they came to talk about the steam engine, it was clear that this merchant from the capital was very interested in it.
He was very clear on how astonishing the profits from industrial products could be, especially those mechanical products that only he could manufacture. He had been worried that once Border Town stopped selling ore, the day would come when the coins moved from the Duke's estate would run out. He hadn't expected such an excellent opportunity to present itself now.
"I see," the prince said with a slight smile, "What you're talking about is called a steam engine. It can transform the steam produced from boiling water into power. The principle is simple, but only Border Town can produce it."
"Does such a thing really exist?"

"Of course," Roland spread his hands, "but it is very complicated to make, and quite expensive. If you are interested, you can follow me to see the actual device."
"I would be delighted," she said excitedly as she stood up.
...
At the North Slope Mine, when Margaret saw the deafening roar of the steel monster slowly pulling the stone-filled mining carts out of the mine, her eyes nearly popped out.
"Your Highness, this, this… is simply incredible," she said with a trembling voice, "I thought your envoy was exaggerating before, but what he said is far from enough... I'm afraid dozens of people together couldn't compare to this... steam engine."
The merchant woman wanted to take a closer look, but Roland stopped her, "A working steam engine is very dangerous, do not get too close to it. See that white vapor coming out? Just a touch of it can scald your skin."
"Do you only use it for hauling ore?" she had to raise her voice and ask because of the loud noise.
"There are two engines for the mine, the First Engine is responsible for pulling the mining carts, and the Second Engine is for pumping water out of the mine," Roland replied, "In fact, since the successful development to this day, Border Town has only produced three steam engines, and I must use them where they are needed most. But its uses are actually very broad, apart from what you see, it can also replace windmills and watermills for grinding wheat, and it’s not affected by rivers and wind. Anywhere that requires a lot of manpower or animal power, it can come in handy, it can even be installed on ships to drive oars, allowing them to sail quickly even without wind!"
He knew how significant a ship that could ignore wind power and direction was to the people of the Fjords. Sure enough, Margaret looked at Roland, her eyes almost shining, "Name your price, I want to buy it!"

"This one won't do, the mine relies on it to maintain production. You can place an order for a few new steam engines first, and we'll settle the payment once the saltpeter is delivered."
"How much does it cost...?"
Roland led her to a position farther away from the mine entrance, where the noise from the machinery wasn't so piercing. "Five hundred Gold royals," he said. The price was a bit exaggerated, almost equivalent to a knight's annual income from his fief. The raw material cost of a steam engine was around twenty Gold royals, and even with smelting fees, labor costs, and installation fees, it wouldn't exceed fifty Gold royals. But buying and selling always involved bargaining.

"Then it's settled! I want to purchase ten steam engines!"
"..." Roland was taken aback; ten units amounted to five thousand gold coins! That was almost equivalent to the savings of Duke Ryan over five to six years. Without even bargaining, was this how big households did business? He cleared his throat, "Are you sure? This isn't a small expense. And machines don't last forever once you buy them; you'll need to keep investing money to maintain them."

"I know, just like with ships that need to be docked every year to clean off the barnacles and algae, replace sails and ropes, and so on," Margaret said nonchalantly, "Whatever needs replacing or adding, I'll just pay to buy it from you. If that doesn't work, just quote me a price, and sell me the craftsmen who maintain and operate the machines as well."

Roland closed his mouth, with only one thought in his mind: it's good to have money.
