"Set out from the Western Region?" Margaret asked curiously, "I didn't know there was a good harbor that leads to the sea around here."

"Not yet, but we can build one."

Her eyes widened. "Your Highness, are you serious?"

"Of course, we should be able to start construction by next spring," Roland said with a smile.

In this era, all harbors were natural without exception. Man-made ports, which required massive projects to change the natural landscape, were almost impossible to achieve.

But now he had Tilly's full support, and once the housing construction on Sleeping Island was completed, Lily would return to the Western Region. By then, the demonic beast disaster would have subsided, making it an ideal time to open a port.

He stood up and pointed to the map hanging behind him, "There is a shoal to the south of Border Town with ideal water depth and area, large enough to accommodate all the facilities a harbor needs. With a bit of modification and by flattening the coastal mountains, I can transport goods out from the inland Western Region."

"Modifying the shoal... leveling mountains, why do I get the feeling that these monumental tasks seem like nothing difficult when you mention them?" Margaret said with interest. "But do you have a merchant fleet? You know, sea ships are very different from riverboats."

"Not at the moment," Roland spread his hands, "That's also why I hope you can be a part of this."



"Me to ship out?" 

"And to take charge of transportation and sales," he added, "The Western Region only provides the goods." 

This was tantamount to exclusive distribution rights in the Fjords. With Margaret's experience, she could naturally see the profits it entailed. Organizing her own caravan to sell in the Fjords would earn more, but Roland did not want to invest too much effort and manpower in this area; he only wanted to quickly exchange for new capital to maintain the rapid development of his territory. Once the initial accumulation was complete, the introduction of credit currency was only a matter of time. 

Sure enough, the businesswoman blinked and asked excitedly, "All entrusted to me?" 

"If the price is right." Roland nodded, "If you are willing to handle the Western Region's overseas trade, we can discuss this in detail. The sales are limited to the Fjords, and must not be lower than the current price sold to the Crescent Moon Bay caravans." 

"Of course, just the steamships that can sail continuously without relying on wind power alone are worth the high price that those overseas caravans would compete for," she said confidently, "if sold directly to the islands of the Fjords, I am confident that I could double the price." 

"And the extra profit, we can share." Roland smiled, "In addition, the main product besides the steam engines is this." He clapped his hands, and a guard waiting outside the hall immediately came in holding a dish with four or five crystal clear glass bottles on it, each only the size of a thumb. 

"What is this…" 

"Open it and take a sniff."



Margaret curiously removed the wooden stopper from the top of the bottle and sniffed it, her eyes lighting up instantly, "My goodness, you've actually made perfume!"

"I wonder how it compares to the products of the Alchemy Association in the capital?"

"The scent seems even richer," she said, holding the bottle and looking at it from all sides, obviously quite taken with it, "Was this made by the Alchemy Workshop in Border Town?"

"Pretty much." Roland also picked up a bottle and held it in his palm—according to his specifications, the perfume bottles were made of crystal glass with excellent transparency and shaped in a standard hexagonal prism. By slightly turning the bottle under the light, the perfume inside would shimmer with various shades, creating a beautiful aesthetic. Following the sales concept of the modern era, exquisite packaging can greatly enhance the perceived value of the product, and as a flagship product to break into the Fjords market, he naturally treated it with care.

Compared to the steam engine, perfume could be regarded as a true low-cost product. Once Evelyn realized that the "spiciest white spirit" was also a type of alcohol, high-concentration alcohol began to be produced continuously from her hands, even skipping the final distillation step. As for roses or other flowers with unique fragrances, they were also transformed by Leaves into high-oil products, requiring only two or three crushed flowers to fill a whole jar of alcohol with their rich scent.

"If you like it, these few bottles are my gift to you." He placed the perfume back on the plate.

"Really?" Margaret smiled, "Then I won't be polite."

"I heard that this stuff can sell for a good price in the Fjords?"

"You should know, the Alchemy Association in the capital has a very limited annual perfume sale, the quantity of more than a thousand bottles is simply not enough to meet demand. Those big merchants are particularly... particular about the fishy smell on their bodies, so perfume is a staple for them. After being sold in the capital for five Gold royals, it can go for fifteen to twenty Gold royals in the Fjords. In fact, a large portion of the perfume sold to other regions is also bought up by overseas merchants and resold."



Margaret paused for a moment, then asked, "Do you know how many bottles of perfume your alchemy workshop can produce in a year?"

"If the raw materials are sufficient, it should be about ten times that of the Alchemy Association in King's City." Roland intentionally lowered the number, as he did not want to sell a highly profitable product for next to nothing, nor did he want to earn only four to five thousand gold coins a year. As a flagship product, on par with the steam engine, he hoped that the perfume would bring in an equivalent profit.

"..." The female merchant was speechless for a good while before she exclaimed, "Your territory is indeed filled with wonders."

"So, are you willing to act as an agent to sell these goods for me?"

"Of course, Your Highness," she stood up, placing a hand on her chest and bowed, "For me, this is also a rare opportunity."

...

After reaching a general agreement, the specific details and contract terms were left to Barov to discuss in detail. Roland returned to his office, preparing to write a letter to Tilly, who was undercover in King's City.

Whether it was to take the initiative to overthrow Timothy or to explore new trade routes, both were part of the plan. He did not want to put all his eggs in one basket; in case the attack failed, he also hoped to continue obtaining saltpeter.

That path was self-production.



In the letter, besides mentioning his own intention to strike, another point was to have Tassa make contact with the niter yards around the King's City to purchase a batch of niter workers and send them to the Western Region.



This year, the saltpeter merchants were certainly not having an easy time. Timothy had banned exports while also forcing them to sell to the Alchemy Association at low prices, which naturally caused the profits of the saltpeter yards to continuously decline. Roland believed that as long as the compensation was generous enough, it would not be difficult to buy out the entire factory and its workers.



The principle of saltpeter production is not complicated. Now, with the continuous increase in the population of Border Town, there is enough manure to meet the large demand of the saltpeter yards, and all the conditions for production have been met. Before defeating Timothy, it would undoubtedly serve as the most stable guarantee.
