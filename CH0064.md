## Curiosity
Three days later, in the castle garden.

"Anna sister..." Nana tugged at Anna's sleeve.

"Hmm?" The latter turned her head.

"Don't you think that Sister Nightingale... she seems a bit strange?"

"Strange?" Anna was taken aback, "Do you mean her clothes?"

Nightingale stood beside Roland, not wearing the strange patterned robe that she never seemed to wash and change, but instead dressed like Anna herself, in the strange outfit invented by His Highness the Prince. Although Anna didn't want to admit it, the other's tall figure showcased the advantages of the outfit vividly—symmetrical legs, a slender waist, and that long curly hair. Paired with a cloak and a pointed hat, anyone's gaze would be drawn to her first.

"It's not about the clothes," Nana muttered, "Don't you think that the tone she uses when she speaks to His Highness, and the way she looks at him, have become different from before?"

"Really?"

"..." Nana pouted, "Alright then, Sister Anna, don't blame me for not warning you when the time comes."



Bewildered, Anna shook her head and ignored her, turning her attention to the two other new witches instead.



The one called Lightning appeared to be about the same size as Nana, but her attire was quite distinctive. Anna roughly counted, and there were at least twelve pockets sewn onto her tattered coat.



As for the other witch, Wendy, she was not dressed in the same patterned robe she wore when they first met, similar to Nightingale's, but rather in ordinary women's casual wear. However, something particular caught Anna's attention—the other party's chest... was truly magnificent.



"Now that you have all agreed to sign the contract, let's proceed with the first training session," Roland, having had the experience of training the previous two witches, was now quite proficient, "Lightning, you go first."



"Oh!" Lightning raised her hand and walked out of the shed.



It was lightly snowing outside, with no wind. The young girl easily floated up into the air, waiting for Roland's next instruction.



"Try your maximum flying speed!" Roland shouted, looking up.



"Hehe, watch this." She gave a thumbs up, struck a running pose, and then swiftly circled around the castle.



Roland estimated her speed visually—it was around sixty to eighty kilometers per hour, a conclusion he reached based on his annual experience of driving on the highway to return to his hometown. In terms of flight alone, this speed was not considered fast, similar to that of an ordinary pigeon. But it was quite astonishing to hear that she was able to fly while carrying Nightingale and Wendy back with her.



What is the concept of taking off with a load of 100 kilograms? Roland envisioned a piston plane with a 100-kilogram bomb hanging from it...

But the subsequent test shattered his beautiful fantasy.

Once the load exceeded fifty kilograms (about 110 pounds), Lightning's flight altitude dropped sharply, from over a hundred meters down to about ten meters. And with a load close to a hundred kilograms, she could barely skim two meters above the ground.

In other words, if Lightning were to transform into a bomber, even with just a few kilograms of explosives, she would have to fly within the strong crossbow range of the enemy because of the altitude issue.

However, Roland quickly thought of a new use for the little girl—whether for reconnaissance or artillery spotting, she was an excellent choice. The encirclement and annihilation plan that had been troubling him now seemed to glimpse the first light of dawn.

As the prince was testing Lightning's abilities, Wendy was quietly observing him from the side.

After leaving the monastery, during her fifteen-year-long wandering, she had seen many people: commoners, farmers, craftsmen, soldiers, nobles. They always showed longing and affection before they knew she was a witch. But once they learned of her witch identity, that longing and affection would instantly turn into fear and loathing, along with a kind of evil desire that almost made Wendy want to vomit.

She had thought that she would only keep the company of witches for the rest of her life and could never get close to any man again. This was also why she planned to refuse Nightingale... Not out of distrust, but from an inner fear.

But Roland Wimbledon changed her mind.



He realized that his own perspective was quite ordinary—just as he had witnessed countless times before, when he first met Roland in Nightingale's room, she thought it was because the other party was very good at concealing himself, and also because Nightingale was there by his side. But in the following days, his demeanor remained the same.



Could it be that the prince's standards were much higher than those of the average noble?



And then there was that contract. Wendy originally thought it was just a formality. However, when she unfolded it and read, she found that it was densely packed with terms, not only stipulating responsibilities but also clearly stating the rights she possessed.



This was simply unbelievable! To take witches under his command without depriving them of freedom was already extremely generous, and yet he even detailed their rights in the contract?



For example, clause 2.1 (Wendy had never seen such a way of writing before), she could have paid leave, which according to the definition below, meant that she could get paid without working. The next clause stated that the witches should complete the experimental projects arranged by the employer, but if the witch felt that part of the project was too difficult to complete or caused discomfort, she could request a change or refuse. Another clause stated that the employer should provide and ensure the safety, accommodation, food, and salary of the witches; if these conditions were not met, the witch could unilaterally terminate the contract.



These clauses were somewhat tongue-twisting, but the meaning was very clearly expressed: the signing witch was not the personal property of the prince; she also possessed rights equivalent to her responsibilities. In this contract, she felt the sincerity of the other party—if it were just for formality, there was no need to list the clauses in such detail.



Thinking of this, Wendy couldn't help but look towards Nightingale. She was very clear about her experiences and understood her deep-seated disdain for nobles. Yet at this moment, when Nightingale was talking with Roland, there was an additional emotion in her tone and demeanor—an emotional change that perhaps she was not even aware of herself.



Departing from the main force and heading to Border Town alone for only two months, Nightingale had completely trusted this man within just a couple of months.



From the fact that she would rather sever ties with the Union and return to Border Town, it seemed that in her heart, Prince Roland Wimbledon was probably more hopeful than the Union in providing witches with a real home. The actions of the Teacher were also saddening; the founder of the Union seemed to have forgotten how difficult it was for any surviving sister to live.



Wendy knew that she could not go back anymore. Since fate had brought her here, why not trust Nightingale's choice once more? Just as she had countless times before—



"Wendy?"



"Ah..." Wendy snapped back to reality and realized that Lightning's ability had already been tested, and everyone was looking at her.



She gave an apologetic smile and walked outside the house.



Once she had made her decision, she couldn't let herself be outdone by the younger generation, right?



Just at that moment, the buzzing of a horn came from the west once again, the sound echoing through the mountains, shattering the tranquility of the town.
