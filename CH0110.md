## Battle of Eagle City (Part 1)
Through the hazy morning mist, Timothy Wimbledon could barely make out the flag fluttering atop the city. He raised his telescope, trying to discern the heraldry on the banners. The green background with a sailboat and crown pattern undoubtedly belonged to his sister, Grace Wimbledon. These were the most numerous flags atop the city wall.



The second most abundant were the white banners, with a high tower and a serpent coiled around it on a white cloth background—the emblem of the Baliar family. Hmph, he sneered inwardly, siding with Queen Clearwater yet still flying the flag with the high tower, utterly shameless. Once I catch you, traitor, I'll make you swallow your flag, Lord Baliar. He thought to himself.



Lastly, there were the red banners with the high tower and the majestic lion, the equally shameless Sitte family. Timothy's face was expressionless, but he had already sentenced Eileen Sitte to death in his heart, just like Toman Baliar. Of course, they too would have to eat their flags.



"Sir Naimen, raise the flag of the Kingdom of Greycastle!" Timothy ordered.



"By your command, Your Majesty," the Coldwind Knight replied, then spurred his horse to run towards the troops behind him, "The King commands, raise the flag!"



The new king turned his head and saw the flagpoles being raised, grey banners unfurling in the wind, the black pattern looking solemn and majestic, the great tower and the crossed long spears on either side—this was the true emblem of the King of Greycastle. Any traitor would bow their head and admit guilt under this banner.



Upon receiving the news of Grace's declaration of independence, he immediately took countermeasures—mobilizing the forces from the Eastern Region and the capital, and attacking Eagle City. Although his heart had been like a stormy sea at the time, he maintained his composure on the surface, which greatly bolstered the confidence of the ministers who supported him.



It took nearly a month to summon the vassals and troops, a week to travel to the Eastern Region, and half a month to get here. Timothy finally arrived at Eagle City yesterday as the sun set. Fortunately, the capital was not greatly affected by the Evil Months, and the road to the Southern Region was not blocked by snow. Instead, the ground was frozen solid due to the low temperatures, and the supply wagons moved even faster than the free folk.



His forces were formidable, primarily consisting of his personal guards, the Royal Knights, and the troops of Duke Ryan Farman from the Eastern Region. Together, the three groups totaled six thousand men, of which a well-trained and well-equipped thousand were knights. Reliable intelligence indicated that Grace's forces numbered less than three thousand, most of whom were freemen from Clearwater Harbor. They were capable of plundering unarmed farmers and merchants, but in a head-on battle, they stood no chance against knights.



Sir Gold, the Minister of Finance, had raised objections. He believed that after the end of the Evil Months, all regions needed to carry out farming activities, and conscripting a large army would adversely affect the harvest. Therefore, Timothy did not demand his vassals to call up serfs for battle; instead, he assembled freemen from his territories to handle logistics and supply. This way, even if they fought in the Southern Territory, they would not fall behind on spring plowing.



Regardless, Timothy Wimbledon could not allow Grace to stay in the Southern Territory any longer. Eagle City was not a strong fortress; its predecessor was a marketplace, perfectly situated in the middle of the surrounding towns. Its transformation into a city had occurred gradually with the development of commerce, not even a hundred years had passed. Moreover, successive lords, in a bid to promote its merchant-friendly image, had not built insurmountable high walls. A force of three thousand civilians along with the soldiers of two earls did not make for a formidable army. The sooner they took countermeasures, the greater the chances of victory. If Grace were given a respite to completely consolidate the Southern Territory, defeating her would become much more difficult.



After an overnight rest, his troops were well-fed and ready to strike. The sun gradually changed from orange-red to a dazzling gold, the mist began to dissipate, and the earthen brown walls revealed their true form—in the eyes of the new king, they could hardly be considered real walls, at most they were just a dirt slope. One could climb from the bottom to the top of the slope without any siege ladders, simply using hands and feet. A circular wooden palisade, a little over a person's height, was haphazardly placed at the top of the slope. It could keep out refugees and bandits, but not fully armed soldiers.



The people on the city walls were sparse, clearly not prepared for a siege.



"Your Majesty, the knights monitoring the south gate have returned with a report—they have observed movement of a large group of troops," a Gale Knight reported as he rode back to the new king's side, pulling his horse to a stop.



Timothy handed the telescope to Duke Ryan, speaking with ease, "It seems she intends to run."



After careful observation, the latter nodded, "To make such a quick decision is indeed a decisive choice. Eagle City is not suitable for a prolonged defense; putting her troops inside would only lead to their capture by our forces." The Duke laughed, "Just as you predicted at last night's military meeting, she did not expect us to arrive so swiftly."



"Our timing is also perfect," Timothy added, "Even if she wishes to flee, she couldn't have moved during the night."



"You are right, marching at night is a taboo. If she really does that, we wouldn't need to attack proactively; her troops would collapse without a fight. Once the soldiers are scattered in the night, they can hardly ever regroup. In this case, even if she escapes back to Clearwater Harbor, she would still be on a path to death."



"Therefore, my dear sister must wait until dawn to command the retreat of her troops." Timothy looked satisfactorily at the Eagle City within his reach, thinking that everything she had done had not exceeded his expectations. Grace was too eager for the symbolic status of Eagle City, stationing her troops here—the residence that guarded the southern border through generations was indeed more conducive to winning the hearts of the southern nobility, but with benefits came risks. He intentionally sent a decoy army to start their journey sluggishly, while he himself led the cavalry ahead to the Eastern Region without infantry, with all provisions being transported by supply wagons. After reaching the Eastern Region, the rest of the troops would be replenished by the Duke, and they would detour to Eagle City from the other side of the kingdom. The cavalry would go ahead to block the roads, reducing the possibility of scouts passing on information.



An army's movement cannot be initiated at a moment's notice. Grace probably received vague news two or three days ago and started the retreat at dawn today, which could be considered a hasty action. It takes a day's march from Eagle City to Clearwater Town, and no matter what, two legs can't outrun four. All he needed to do was to gather a thousand knights to catch up to her troops and pursue them from behind, and her laughable allied army would naturally collapse.



Regrettably, Grace still had a chance to escape from his grasp. If she abandoned the three thousand men and left with a double mount, it wouldn't be difficult for her to return to Clearwater Harbor alive.



Ultimately, he thought, it would be necessary to go to her lair to put an end to this farce.



"Your Majesty, shall we then proceed with the plan we have set earlier?" Duke Fernando asked, "Will you wait for me to attack and go through the city to pursue from the south gate, or take a detour? If you take a detour, it will be a longer route."



"I think it's better for me to go around from the southwest," Timothy pondered, "Knights are inconvenient to move in narrow streets, and Grace might also block the streets with debris to hinder the passage of troops. Even if taking a detour means being an hour late at night, it won't interfere with the subsequent pursuit."



"Then I shall depart, Your Majesty."



"Be careful," Timothy warned, "Grace is unlikely to leave any troops in the city, but I expect there will be plenty of traps. Also, beware of areas with narrow streets and many houses. Just an ambush by a group of desperate fighters could threaten your safety."



"Hahaha," Duke Fern laughed heartily, "Your Majesty, rest assured, I have personally beheaded hundreds when I campaigned with your father, and I have never been wounded." He waved his hand to his personal guards, "Sound the horn, charge!"



The army behind him surged forward, with several streams of people stepping out of the formation. Under the leadership of a few knights, they advanced towards Eagle City—the vanguard consisting of freemen. Following them were the mercenaries clad in armor, who were the main force in this siege. The knights brought by the Duke had all gathered under his command.



As the main force began their assault on the walls, Timothy led the remaining knights and retinue to advance towards the southwest.
