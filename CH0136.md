## predicament
For the past half a month, Clearwater Harbor has been festive, and even standing on the terrace at the top of the lord's tower, Farryn could feel the surging atmosphere in the city.

The materials and population moved from Eagle City greatly expanded the strength of this port city, with the plunderers each reaping a great harvest, and the slave market also became lively. After this series of battles, the Black Sail Fleet not only suffered little loss but also recruited a large number of slaves to serve as sailors, and they are now training heatedly at the harbor. In a few days, they will head to the fjord route to begin this year's first plunder.

Her Majesty the Queen also timely promulgated the Slave Pioneer Decree, which stated that as long as these slaves captured from Eagle City could seize new people as replacements in the raid, they could leap from slaves to become citizens of Clearwater Harbor. Undoubtedly, with such an inspiring decree, those Eagle City residents who have become slaves will also fight with all their might.

Now that Timothy has been defeated and returned, there is no one in the Kingdom of Greycastle who can stop the Queen of Clearwater. Given time, Grace Wimbledon is bound to become the master of Greycastle. Farryn thought so, but why didn't the Queen have much joy on her face, instead, there was a trace of gloom that lingered between her brows?

"Your Majesty, the chiefs of the Sandstone and Blackbone clans seek an audience," the voice of the guard came from outside.

Farryn glanced at the Queen, and seeing that she gave no sign, he called out, "Let them in."

The Queen liked to conduct her rest, meetings, or receiving visitors at the top of this tower. As long as the weather was fine, the terrace was where Grace spent the most time. Most people are not comfortable standing in mid-air, discussing matters while facing the slightly fishy sea breeze. The Sand People were no exception.

The chief of the Sandstone clan was a petite woman who was also the priestess of the clan. When Farryn first heard this introduction, he scoffed in his heart—what priestess, she was just a fallen witch. The chief of the Blackbone clan, on the other hand, was tall and muscular, his face covered with scars, and his arms as thick as an average person's thighs. Every time they met, three or four guards would surround him, in case he harbored ill intentions towards the Queen.

The moment they stepped onto the terrace, both chiefs simultaneously frowned, but they quickly composed themselves and knelt before the Queen of Clearwater with the utmost respect, saying, "May oases spread before you, and may the stars in the sky illuminate your path."

"Get up," Grace said, sitting down with her back against the railing. "How is it? Are you satisfied with your new residence?"
"All is well," the Divine Lady Cara spoke up first. "The domain has forests and water sources, which are much more comfortable than the sandy Ironsand City."
"That's good to hear. What brings you here?"
"Your Majesty, last time you gave—"
The chieftain of the Skeletons had just started to speak when he was interrupted by Cara, "It's like this, Your Majesty. After the last battle, many warriors showed signs of weakness and listlessness. They can only recover by taking new pills regularly, but we don't have many left. I am here to ask you to distribute more pills to us."
"I meant the same," the chieftain of the Skeletons glared at the Divine Lady and said in a muffled voice.
"The materials for making these pills are quite complex, and I don't have much in stock right now. Don't worry, as soon as the new batch of pills is made, I will distribute them to you as quickly as I can. But don't forget to prepare Gold royals. If that's not enough, you can also use the water from the Styx to settle the account."
"Your Majesty, if I may be so bold to ask," Cara hesitated for a moment, "do you know when the next batch will be ready?"
"I can't tell you that," Grace smoothed her hair, disheveled by the sea breeze, "All information regarding the pills is secret. Go back and wait patiently. Those warriors are just listless, they will be fine with more rest."

The guards, upon receiving Ferlin's hint, stepped forward to surround the Sand People and "escorted" Kabala and Blackbone, who still had a few more questions, away.

After the terrace room door was closed, Grace let out a soft sigh.

Ferlin rarely heard Her Majesty make such a sound, so he took the initiative to ask, "Your Majesty, do you think it's inappropriate to grant the lands near the southern border to the Sand People for settlement? What if they become powerful one day..."

"No, Ferlin," Grace shook her head, "I have never worried about the Sand People, they pose no threat to Clearwater Harbor. The lake in that land is right in the middle of the two clans' territories, and the upstream passes through Clearwater Harbor. As long as I block half of the river, the reduced lake water will make them fight among themselves first. That's why I chose Sandstone and Blackbone—they have never been on good terms."

"Then are you worried about the pill issue?"

Grace did not answer, and at this moment, a guard knocked on the door again, saying, "Your Majesty, the church priest Di Karl requests an audience."

"Let him in." The queen immediately stood up, her expression growing darker.

"Her Majesty Grace Wimbledon, I bring greetings from the Holy City on behalf of the church," the priest bowed as he stepped onto the terrace.

"Where are the pills? Why were the previous batches delivered on time, but these last few are delayed?" Grace asked coldly.

"Your Majesty, please calm your anger, I have come for this very matter," Di Karl wiped the sweat from his forehead, "The number you requested, five thousand, is simply too much. Even if Hermes were to work at full capacity, they couldn't meet your demand in such a short time. This time I've brought a new batch—"
"How many?" Grace interrupted.
"One thousand," Di Karl said, placing his hand over his heart, "The rest will be delivered in due course."
"And what was your previous promise?" Her expression softened slightly, "As many as I want, whenever I want. Where are the pills? I'll send someone to collect them."
"They are in the church, I wonder about the Gold royals..."
"You won't be short a single Gold royal," Grace stepped up to Di Karl and whispered in his ear, "But if the rest of the pills are late, your head will hang from the prow of the flagship of the Black Sail, and I doubt the Archbishop would shed a tear for you."
After the priest retreated with a pale face, she returned to the railing to look out at the distant sea horizon. The sea breeze lifted her gray hair, much like the flags fluttering in the wind atop the fleet's masts.
"You are right to worry about the pills," Grace's voice sounded distant, "If Timothy were to delay another two months, my preparations would be more complete, and I could defeat his capital's Knights of the City without relying on the pills. Unfortunately, he arrived a bit too soon."
"You have already done very well," Farrein thought, who else could have done better? From the moment she took control of Eagle City, she had a plan in place, ordering the removal of supplies and residents, while digging trenches in the city to backfill with black water. Facing a shortage of hands, she exchanged the desolate lands of the South for the support of the Sand People and had clan warriors who had taken the pills strike the Knights of the City from both sides. Her loyal followers, to withstand the final overwhelming charge, did not hesitate to swallow the secret medicine.

"The secret medicine provided by the Church is not as harmless to life as I have said. If not replenished in time, the user will become irritable and restless, then die amidst weakness, pain, and atrophy of limbs. I do not care about the life and death of the Sand People, but the serfs who serve me deserve the best recompense." She paused, "Farrina, take someone to retrieve the pills, and then distribute them to those brave warriors. Let them split the pills in half to make them last longer."

"As you wish, Your Majesty."

Just as Farrina was about to take her leave, the guard's voice rang out for the third time, "Your Highness, there is a secret letter from the capital."

"Read it before you go," she said.

"Yes." Farrina took back the secret letter, expertly sliced open the seal, and extracted the paper. Such secret letters were mostly intelligence sent back by spies lurking in various places, with no signature or addressee, and the contents were usually as concise and clear as possible. But when she read the first sentence, she stood frozen on the spot.

— "On the twenty-second day of spring, the Church accused Queen Jelina of Everwinter as a witch who had been in hiding for many years, seized the capital of the kingdom, and proclaimed the takeover of the entirety of Everwinter."
