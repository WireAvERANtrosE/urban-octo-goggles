## Predicament
For the past half a month, Clearwater Harbor has been as lively as a festival. Even standing on the balcony at the top of the lord's tower, Farren could feel the buoyant atmosphere in the city.



The materials and population moved from Eagle City greatly expanded the strength of this seaport city. The plunderers each reaped a bountiful harvest, and the slave market became lively as well. The Black Sail Fleet, after this series of battles, not only suffered little loss but also recruited a large number of slaves to serve as sailors, who are currently in the midst of intense training at the harbor. In a few days, they will head to the Fjords to begin this year's first plundering campaign.



Her Majesty the Queen also timely promulgated the Slave Pioneer Decree, stating that these slaves captured from Eagle City could rise from slavehood to become citizens of Clearwater Harbor if they could capture new replacements during their raids. With such an inspiring decree, the residents of Eagle City who had fallen into slavery would surely fight with all their might.



Now that Timothy has been defeated and returned, there is no one in the Kingdom of Greycastle who can stand against the Queen of Clearwater. Given time, Grace Wimbledon will inevitably become the ruler of Greycastle. Farren thought so, but why didn't the Queen have much joy on her face, instead, there was a lingering shadow between her brows?



"Your Majesty, the chiefs of the Sandstone Clan and the Blackbone Clan request an audience," the voice of a guard came from outside the door.



Farren glanced at Her Majesty and, seeing no response from her, called out, "Bring them in."



The Queen always liked conducting her rest, meetings, or receiving visitors at the top of this high tower. As long as the weather was suitable, the balcony was the place where Grace spent the most time. Most people were not used to standing in mid-air, discussing matters while facing the slightly fishy sea breeze. The Sand People were no exception.



The chief of the Sandstone Clan was a petite woman, also the goddess of the clan. When Farren first heard this introduction, he scoffed inwardly, thinking: What goddess? She is but a fallen witch. The chief of the Blackbone Clan, on the other hand, was tall and burly, with a face full of scars and arms as thick as an average person's thighs. Every time they met, there would be three or four guards surrounding him to prevent any malicious intent towards Her Majesty the Queen.



The moment they stepped onto the balcony, both chiefs simultaneously furrowed their brows, but they quickly composed themselves and knelt down respectfully before the Queen of Clearwater, saying, "May your path be covered with oases, and may the stars in the sky illuminate your way."



"Rise," Grace said, sitting down with her back to the railing. "How do you like your new residence?"



"Everything is fine," the Divine Lady Kabala said hastily. "There are forests and water sources in the territory, much more comfortable than the sandy Iron Sand City."



"That's good to hear. What brings you here?"



"Your Majesty, the last time you gave—"



The chieftain of the Blackbone tribe had just begun to speak when Kabala interrupted him, "It's like this, Your Majesty. After the last battle, many warriors have shown signs of weakness and languor, and only by regularly taking new medicine can they get better. But we don't have many pills left. I am here to ask you to distribute more pills to us."



"That's what I meant as well." Blackbone gave the Divine Lady a glare and muttered.



"The ingredients to make this thing are very complex, and I don't have much left now. Don't worry, as soon as the new batch of pills is made, I'll distribute them to you as quickly as possible. But don't forget to prepare the Gold royals. If that's not enough, you can settle the account with the Underworld River water."



"Your Majesty, if I may be so bold," Kabala hesitated for a moment, "may I ask when the next batch will be ready?"



"I can't tell you that," Grace said, smoothing her hair that had been disheveled by the sea breeze. "Everything about the pills is a secret. Go back and wait patiently. Those warriors are just languishing, they'll be fine with more rest."



The guards, upon receiving a hint from Ferlin, stepped forward to surround the Sand People, leading Kabala and Blackbone, who still wanted to ask more questions, away.



After the door to the terrace room closed, Grace let out a slight sigh.



Ferlin rarely heard Her Majesty make such a sound and took the initiative to ask, "Your Majesty, do you think it's inappropriate to give the land near the southern border to the Sand People for settlement? If one day they become powerful..."



"No, Ferlin," Grace shook her head, "I have never worried about the Sand People; they can't pose any threat to Clearwater Harbor. The lake in that land is right between the territories of the two clans, and the upstream passes through Clearwater Harbor. As long as I block half of the river, the reduced lake water will make them fight among themselves first. That is why I chose the Sandstone and Blackbone—their relationship has always been tense."



"Then are you worried about the pill issue?"



Grace did not answer, and just then, the guard knocked on the door again, saying, "Your Majesty, Church Priest Karl requests an audience."



"Let him in." The Queen immediately stood up, her expression growing even more somber.



"Her Majesty Grace Wimbledon, I bring greetings from the Holy City on behalf of the Church," the priest said as he ascended the terrace and bowed.



"Where are the pills? Why did the previous batches arrive on time, but these last few have been delayed?" Grace asked coldly.



"Your Majesty, please calm your anger. I have come exactly for this matter," said Karl van Bate, wiping the sweat from his forehead. "The quantity you requested to purchase is simply too much. Even if Hermes went all out, we can't fulfill your demand in a short time. This time, I've brought a new batch—"

"How many?" Grace interrupted.

"One thousand," Karl van Bate said, placing a hand over his chest, "The rest will also be delivered in succession."

"And what was your previous promise?" Her expression softened slightly, "As many as wanted. Where are the pills? I will send someone to fetch them."

"They are in the church. I wonder about the Gold royals..."

"You won't be short a single Gold royal," Grace said, approaching Karl van Bate and whispering in his ear, "But if the subsequent pills are delayed, your head will be hung on the prow of the flagship of the Black Sail Fleet. I don't think the Archduke would shed a tear for you."

After the pale-faced priest excused himself, she returned to the railing, gazing at the distant horizon where the sea met the sky. The sea breeze lifted her gray hair, like the flags fluttering on the mast of the fleet.

"You're right, I am worried about the pills," Grace's voice seemed distant, "If Timothy had been delayed by two more months, my preparations would have been more sufficient, and I could defeat his Royal Capital's Knights without relying on the pills. It's a pity he came too fast."

"You've already done an excellent job," thought Farrina. Who else could have done better? Since taking over Eagle City, she had made a contingency plan: ordering people to remove supplies and civilians while digging trenches in the city to flood them with black water. With a shortage of hands, she exchanged the desolate lands of the Southern Territory for the support of the Sand People and ordered the clan warriors who had taken the pills to strike the Knights from both sides. Her loyal followers, to withstand the last overwhelming charge, did not hesitate to swallow the secret medicine.



"The secret medicine provided by the Church is not as harmless to life as I have said. If it is not replenished in time, the user will become agitated and restless, and then die amidst weakness, pain, and muscle atrophy. I don't care about the life or death of the Sand People, but the serfs who serve me should receive the best reward." She paused, "Farrina, take some people to retrieve the pills, and then distribute them to those brave warriors. Have them take half each to make it last a bit longer."

"Your will be done, Your Majesty."

As Farrina was about to take her leave, the guard's voice rang out for the third time outside the door, "Your Highness, there is a secret letter from the King's City."

"Read it before you go," she said.

"Yes." Farrina took back the secret letter, skillfully cut open the seal, and extracted the paper. Such secret letters were mostly intelligence sent back by spies lurking in various places, without a signature or a recipient, and the content was usually as concise and clear as possible. But when he saw the first sentence, he stood frozen on the spot.

—"On the twenty-second day of Spring, the Church accused Queen Jelena of Everwinter of being a witch who had been in hiding for many years and seized the capital of the Kingdom, declaring the takeover of the entire territory of Everwinter."
