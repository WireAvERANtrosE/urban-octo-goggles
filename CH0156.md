## Jigsaw Puzzle
Theo climbed over a small hill and could vaguely make out the silhouette of Border Town's lord's castle from here.

Finally back, he thought. It had taken nearly a month and a half to set out, but only seven days to return, most of that time having been spent on the road from Silver City to Redwater City. Although Ashes herself did not mind, he had still chosen the less traveled paths to reduce the likelihood of being targeted by the Church.

Ashes was the witch known as the Guide, and Theo wasn't sure if that name was real or fake. She always traveled in a black robe, with a great sword wrapped in cloth on her back. Her black hair was simply tied into a ponytail, swinging at her waist. Whether riding or by boat, she rarely paid attention to herself, instead walking ahead alone, looking around at the scenery. For her, this trip to Border Town was probably nothing more than a leisurely sightseeing tour.

Sometimes Theo doubted his own judgment. Was she really a warrior? Loose robes could get in the way, long hair was a liability, and Ashes seemed utterly fearless of being attacked from behind. Most of what he had seen these days was her back. He did not think that witches naturally trusted others easily; he could only guess that she had the ability to protect herself, even from God's Punishment Stones.

Theo circled around the hill and quickly found his target—a flagpole with a red cloth tied to it. He dug out a package from the muddy ground next to the flagpole, replaced the red flag with the folded blue cloth inside, and then patted his hands, sitting down on the ground with a plop.

"Is that all right?" Ashes asked.

"That's what they said," Theo wiped the sweat from his forehead, "'Head to the foothills northeast of the town, follow a stone-stepped path up the mountain, find the flagpole at the top, and change to the blue flag. Our people will notice.' The Mutual Aid Society only acts at night, so let's wait here."

Ashes nodded, found a relatively clean spot to sit down, and stretched out her hand, "Food."

"Uh... wait a moment." He untied his backpack, fumbled out a piece of jerky, tore off half and stuffed it into his own mouth, then tossed the rest to her.



Seeing the witch nibbling at the jerky, Theo sighed. Aside from a greatsword, she didn't even have a single Bronze royal on her, daring to swagger to Border Town with him penniless. He had to pay for all the lodging and food along the way. She demanded a top-quality single room and insisted on meat for meals. Moreover, he had to taste half of any portable food like dry rations first.



It seemed she was quite cautious in areas beyond her capabilities. But wasn't the most cautious approach to prepare her own food?



"The place we are heading to is across the strait," Ashes swallowed the jerky and suddenly spoke up, "I don't know if you've heard of the rumors of the Fjords, where there are countless islands, some with harsh environments, scarcely populated. We plan to establish a homeland for witches there."



Theo was stunned, as no matter how much he had probed before, she had remained tight-lipped. Why was she suddenly bringing this up now?



"Are you wondering why I didn't reveal any information to you before?" She explained seriously, "Because if you were a swindler and ran off to inform the Church while I was asleep at night, those girls could be intercepted halfway and meet a cruel fate. But now, they should already be on a merchant ship heading for the Fjords, beyond the reach of the Church. Besides, I am here to take the witches of the Cooperation Association with me, and they will need to know this information sooner or later. It's pointless to keep hiding it."



"But even after bringing you here, that doesn't rule out the possibility that I could be a swindler."



"That's correct," Ashes said word by word, "If the one who ends up coming is not a witch, then you will die here, along with those who thought to harm the witches."



"Alright," Theo breathed a sigh of relief, "Can I ask other questions?"



She thought for a moment, "If I can answer them."



"You're from Greycastle? I've never seen eyes like that," Theo decided to start by asking about the other party's origins. This information was neither sensitive nor likely to raise the other's defenses. 

"I was born in the Kingdom of Everwinter, but this has nothing to do with the color of my eyes. Since I became a witch, my eyes turned into what you see now."

"Everwinter? That's quite far from Greycastle, with two large kingdoms lying in between. How did you come to Silver City?"

"I was once sold to the Church, and then..." She paused, "I wandered from the old Holy City's monastery all the way to the capital of Greycastle, until I met her, and my wandering life came to an end."

"Her?" Theo asked curiously.

"Tilly Wimbledon," Ashes showed a warm look in her eyes, "She took me in."

The guard's heart jolted. When he first heard this name, he thought it might be a coincidence, but with the surname Wimbledon, it meant something completely different. Could it be that the person who led the witches to the Fjords was Roland Wimbledon's sister, the fifth princess of the kingdom? His voice even stuttered, "She, she's your leader?"

"Leader? You could say that," she nodded, "But to me, she is the most important person... irreplaceable by anyone else."

With nightfall, the two lit a campfire on the hillside.



Ashes removed the greatsword, bit by bit pulling back the cloth—this terrifying weapon had a blade nearly as wide as one's waist, covered with marks left from collisions. The dark gray edge was not sharpened, clearly relying on its weight during a swing to take lives. An ordinary person would find it very difficult to even lift this weapon, but in her hand, it was as easy to handle as a one-handed sword.



How many blacksmith shops would one have to rob to gather the materials needed to forge such a greatsword, Theo thought. If His Highness's witch does not arrive soon, I might end up being a victim of this sword.



"I heard that the lord of Border Town is also a Wimbledon," he decided to strike up a conversation, as the wait was becoming unbearable.



"Roland Wimbledon, the fourth prince of Greycastle," she said calmly. "I have met him."



"What?" Theo's mouth fell open.



"After Tilly took me in, I served as her guard in the palace, naturally having the chance to meet her siblings." Ashes seemed to know a lot about the fourth prince. "Incompetent, arrogant, ignorant. It's hard to believe that he's Tilly's own brother. And... in some ways, he's quite bold."



Towards the end, her tone had gradually turned cold.



Theo couldn't help but shiver; during his service at the palace, he had heard plenty of rumors about His Highness, such as his unrestrained speech, his flirtatious nature, and his fondness for teasing other people's maids. Although he never went as far as to use his power or violence to threaten others, taking some small liberties was inevitable. Could it be...



Just then, Ashes suddenly stood up, staring in the direction of the path, "Someone's coming, more than one."



Theo followed her gaze and saw a line of figures gradually emerging in the night. The witch leading them was none other than the prince's personal guard, Nightingale.
