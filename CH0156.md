## Jigsaw Puzzle
Tassa crested a small hill, from where the silhouette of the Border Town's lord's castle was already faintly visible.
Finally back, he thought. The journey there had taken nearly a month and a half, but the return trip had only taken seven days, most of which was spent on the road from Silver City to Redwater City. Although Ashes herself didn't mind, he still chose to take the less traveled paths to reduce the likelihood of being targeted by the Church.
Ashes was the witch known as the Guide, though Tassa wasn't sure if that name was real or fake. She always traveled in a black robe, with a large sword wrapped in cloth on her back. Her long black hair was simply tied into a ponytail that swayed at her waist. Whether riding or by boat, she rarely paid attention to herself but walked ahead alone, taking in the scenery. For her, this trip to Border Town seemed nothing more than a leisurely sightseeing tour.
Sometimes Tassa questioned his own judgment. Was she really a warrior? Loose robes could get in the way, long hair was a vulnerability, and Ashes seemed utterly unafraid of him attacking her from behind. What he had seen most during this time was her back. He didn't believe that witches were naturally trusting, so he could only guess that she had the ability to protect herself, even from the Divine Stone of Judgement.
Tassa circled around the hill and quickly found his target—a flagpole with a red cloth hanging from it. He dug out a bundle from the muddy ground by the flagpole, replaced the red cloth with a folded blue one he took from the bundle, then dusted off his hands and sat down on the ground with a thump.
"Is that it?" Ashes asked.
"That's what they said," Tassa wiped the sweat from his forehead, "'Head to the foothills northeast of the town, follow a stone stairway up to the top of the hill, find the flagpole, and change the flag to blue. Our people will notice it.' The Mutual Aid Society only operates at night. Let's just wait here."
Ashes nodded, found a relatively clean spot to sit down, and stretched out her hand, "Food."
"Uh... wait a moment." He unfastened his backpack, fished out a piece of jerky, tore off half and stuffed it into his mouth, and then tossed the rest to her.

Seeing the witch nibbling on the jerky, Tassa sighed. Apart from a greatsword, she didn't even have a single bronze royal on her, yet she dared to swagger along with him to Border Town without a penny to her name, with all the accommodation and meal expenses paid by himself. She demanded a top-grade single bedroom and insisted on having meat for meals, and even for portable food like jerky, he had to taste half of it first.
It seemed that in areas beyond her abilities, she was quite cautious. But the most cautious approach should have been to prepare her own food, right?

"The place we're going to is across the strait," Ashes swallowed the jerky and suddenly spoke up, "I don't know if you've heard the rumors about the Fjords, there are countless islands there, some with very harsh environments and sparsely populated. We're going to establish a homeland for witches there."

"..." Tassa was stunned. No matter how much he tried to inquire before, she had remained tight-lipped; why was she suddenly bringing this up now?

"Are you wondering why I didn't reveal any information to you before?" She explained earnestly, "Because if you were a swindler, you could have informed the church in the middle of the night while I was sleeping, and those girls might have been intercepted and killed on their way. But now, they should already be on a merchant ship heading to the Fjords, beyond the reach of even the church. Besides, I am here to take the witches from the Cooperative Association, and they will have to know this information sooner or later, so there's little point in continuing to hide it."

"But even after bringing you here, I could still be a swindler," he pointed out.

"That's true," Ashes said, enunciating each word, "If it turns out that the person who comes is not a witch, then you will die here, along with those who dare to harm witches."

"Alright," Tassa exhaled in relief, "Can I ask other questions?"

She thought for a moment, "If I can answer them."

"You are from Greycastle? I have never seen such eyes before," Tassa decided to start by asking about the other party's origin, as such information was neither sensitive nor likely to raise any opposition.
"I was born in the Kingdom of Everwinter, but this has nothing to do with the color of my eyes. Ever since I became a witch, my eyes have looked like this."
"Everwinter? That's quite far from Greycastle, with two large kingdoms lying in between. How did you come to City of Silver?"
"I was sold to the Church, and then..." she paused, "I wandered all the way from the old Holy City's monastery to the capital of Greycastle, until I met her, and only then did my life of drifting come to an end."
"Her?" Tassa asked curiously.
"Tilly Wimbledon," Ashes said with a warm look in her eyes, "she took me in."
The bodyguard was shocked, initially thinking it was just a coincidence of names, but with the surname Wimbledon, the meaning was completely different. The person who led the witches to the Fjords, could it be Roland Wimbledon's sister, the fifth princess of the kingdom? His voice stuttered a bit, "She, she is your leader?"
"Leader? You could say that," she nodded, "but to me, she is the most important person... irreplaceable by anyone."
As night fell, the two lit a campfire on the hillside.

Ashes removed the greatsword, slowly unwrapping the cloth around it—this terrifying weapon had a blade nearly as wide as one's waist, covered with marks left by countless collisions. The dark grey edge was not sharpened, clearly relying solely on its weight during a swing to claim lives. Ordinary people would find it extremely difficult to even lift such a weapon, but in her hands, it was as light as a one-handed sword.

How many blacksmith shops would one have to rob to gather enough materials to forge a greatsword like this, Tassa wondered. If Prince His Highness's witch didn't arrive soon, he might very well become a victim beneath that sword.

"I heard that the lord of Border Town is also a... Wimbledon." He decided to make some conversation, as the wait was becoming unbearably tense.

"Roland Wimbledon, the fourth prince of Greycastle," she said calmly. "I have met him."

"What?" Tassa's mouth fell open.

"After Tilly took me in, I served in the palace as her guard, naturally having the chance to meet her siblings," Ashes seemed to know quite a bit about the fourth prince, "Incompetent, arrogant, and ignorant. It's hard to believe that he's actually Tilly's biological brother. And... in some ways, he's quite daring."

Her tone grew colder as she spoke.

Tassa couldn't help but shiver; he had heard many rumors about His Highness during his time in the palace—such as his unrestrained speech, his flirtatious nature, and his fondness for teasing other people's maids. Although he never went as far as using his power or violence to threaten anyone, taking minor advantages was inevitable. Could it be...

Just then, Ashes suddenly stood up, staring in the direction of the path, "Someone's coming, more than one."

Tassa followed her gaze, and a line of figures gradually emerged in the night. The witch leading them was none other than the prince's personal guard, Nightingale.
