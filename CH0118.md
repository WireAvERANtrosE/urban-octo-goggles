## Pursuit (Part 2)
Although Roland made the First Army train twice a week, he had never tried a night march. Deploying troops at night was a dangerous affair, as it was hard to see the road, and they could easily be attacked by wild animals and venomous snakes, lose their way, or become natural targets by lifting torches. Therefore, he had no choice but to wait until daylight the next day to have the troops set out, following the Duke's Allied Army.



To ensure the success of this operation, the prince decided to follow the First Army into battle. Of course, compared to riding a horse, which was both bumpy and chafing, he chose to ride aboard the "Littletown."



After half a month of training, Hummingbird had been able to control the lightening process of the twelve-pound cannon within a fixed range. Considering the longer enchanting process, Roland arranged for her to transform the cannons at dawn, making the duration of the first cannon the longest, with the remaining ones decreasing successively, ensuring that the lightening effect of all four cannons expired as simultaneously as possible.



Thanks to Hummingbird's ability, the "Littletown" could now transport four cannons and their crews in one go. The large concrete ship was crowded with people—aside from the cannon crew and Roland, Anna, Nightingale, Nana, Leaf, Echo, Hummingbird, and Titus Pine were also aboard the "Littletown," with Wendy providing the power and Carter steering.



It could be said that, with the exception of Scroll, Soraya, Lily, and Miya, who were not adept at combat, nearly all the witches of Border Town had turned out. Anna originally did not need to be on the battlefield, but her determined gaze ultimately made it impossible for Roland to harden his heart and leave her behind.



The ground forces consisted of the First Army's gunners, led by Chief Knight Carter and Iron Axe, with Lightning undertaking the full-time task of positioning and tracking. The group quietly followed behind the enemy at a distance just outside the range of their scouts' patrols. Whenever Lightning detected scout activity, the troops would stop advancing. Along the way, they also captured quite a few stray mercenaries and freemen, but at the moment, there was no way to deal with these surrendering enemies. All they could do was disarm them and have the members who had not been assigned firearms guard them, taking them along on the road.



This was also the first time that Roland led a "large army" to campaign against the enemy. He stood at the bow of the "Littown," feeling the morning breeze against his face, with a sense of eager anticipation in his heart.



"What are you smiling about?" Anna suddenly appeared beside him, looking up to ask.



"Uh..." Roland instantly wiped the smile off his face, "It's nothing."

"Is that so?" She handed him a handkerchief, "Wipe off the drool."

"..." Roland suddenly felt the urge to jump into the water, "Thank you."



By the time Lightning reported the enemy encampment, the sun had set. Clearly, after suffering a major defeat, the morale of the allied forces had plummeted to rock bottom. As soon as dusk fell, the scouting knights hurried back to the camp, fearful of missing out on the horse meat served for dinner.



Roland's troops were stationed on the shore, two kilometers away from the Duke's army.



Not having been discovered along the way, the annihilation plan was already half successful.



All that remained was to wait for dawn and complete the encirclement before the enemy set out.



This was also Roland's first time spending the night outdoors. Compared to a campsite crawling with all kinds of reptiles, he preferred to sleep on the ship. The shed used to store the cannon carriages was cleared out, and the gun crew members unloaded the twelve-pound cannons and moved into the camp. The "Littletown" became the prince's temporary palace. Aside from Roland, the other witches also spent the night on the ship. Everyone spread out blankets across the shed and lay down shoulder to shoulder, fully clothed.



Roland had intended to be reserved, but he found that the witches cared even less than he did. Except for Anna, they had all suffered their fair share of hardships. During their days of displacement and wandering, sleeping outdoors was nothing out of the ordinary. Before long, everyone fell into a deep sleep, except for Roland and Anna. The former, used to soft beds, found it hard to adapt to the hard deck, while the latter seemed to be pondering something, always lying on her side, watching Roland. Whenever the prince turned his head, Anna would quickly close her eyes, pretending to be asleep, but under the moonlight, her eyelashes could still be seen trembling slightly. If it wasn't for the fear of disturbing others, Roland really wanted to pinch her delicate nose, force her to open her eyes, and then embrace her in his arms.



Thus, neither of them slept much through the night.

Before dawn broke, Roland initiated his plan for a pincer movement: Two hundred and seventy riflemen were to be divided into two groups. One group, along with two cannons, was to be transported by the "Littletown" to the rear of the Duke's army, where they would set up their defenses a kilometer away. Lightning was responsible for monitoring the Duke's movements. Once the rear group had set up their cannons, the little girl would give a signal. At that moment, the troops led by Carter, who were left behind, would begin their frontal assault.

The use of cement boats for transport eliminated the possibility of troops getting scattered during the march. Nightingale, entering her black and white vision after stepping into the mist, could use it as a night vision device. With her as the navigator, the "Littletown" could navigate as well during the day as at night.

This entire process had been repeatedly practiced, and everyone knew what they had to do even with their eyes closed. Wendy expanded the output of wind power, and the "Littletown" almost seemed to be riding the waves as it transported the troops in batches to the rear. Approximately an hour later, Iron Axe led the blocking force into position. Lightning flew over Carter's camp and displayed an orange flag.

It was just then that the first light of dawn broke.

The encirclement plan officially began.

Since Echo was assigned to the rear to fight, the riflemen responsible for the frontal assault did not need to move. They simply needed to form a battle line to protect the two cannons. The twelve-pound cannons were quickly pushed into position and fired at the enemy's camp—most of the Duke's army was still asleep at this time.

With the rumble of cannon fire, solid cannonballs whistled toward the camp. Knights and mercenaries, jolted from their deep slumber, rushed out of their tents, only to find that the First Army had already formed a horizontal line, quietly waiting in place. With the memory of the previous day's terrible defeat, no one dared to challenge this seemingly fragile line of defense; they could only flee en masse towards the east.

Iron Axe had been waiting for a long time behind them.



As the enemy came into view, the encirclement plan was finally coming to the moment of tightening the noose.



With the echoes of the marching band, the First Army, 150 strong, stepped to the beat of the drum, forming two neat rows as they advanced toward the enemy—to put pressure on the Duke's army, Iron Axe had to take the initiative to strike. If they held their position, the enemy, once they snapped out of their shock, would likely abandon their mounts and escape through the woods.



the Duke of Lion was in despair, utterly unable to comprehend how the enemy had appeared behind them.



Admit defeat and surrender? He did not know how Roland Wimbledon would treat a duke who had dared to draw his blade against the royal family—perhaps imprisonment, perhaps exile, or more likely a direct trip to the guillotine. Whichever it was, he was certain that Longsong Stronghold would have nothing to do with him from now on.



Seeing the troops closing in step by step, and the terrifying weapons behind them that occasionally roared and flashed with fire, he knew that if he did not charge now, he would never have the chance again. With only a little over thirty men left by his side, this was his last opportunity.



"They can't stop us with so few men," the Duke shouted, "Just break through their line, and with only their legs, they won't be able to catch up. We're only half a day's journey from Longsong Stronghold! Knights, charge with me!"



Then the Duke spurred his mount to accelerate, but unfortunately, not everyone had the spirit to fight to the death. Only about ten men, including his personal guards, followed him in the charge, but he could no longer afford to care about that.



The music stopped abruptly.



The enemy halted their march in unison, standing before him like a wall.



Then he saw those people raise the short sticks in their hands.

When the Duke of Lion was only a hundred steps away from the human wall, a series of ping-pong sounds rang out continuously. He felt a sudden jolt in his chest and abdomen, as if struck by a large hammer. Following that was a sensation of numbness and weakness; his body leaned back, falling off the horse onto the ground.

The Duke opened his mouth to say something, but no sound came out. He coughed twice, only to smell a strong, sweet, and fishy odor; a thick liquid blocked his throat. Soon, darkness enveloped him.
