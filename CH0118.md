## Pursuit (Part 2)
Although Roland had the First Army carry out drills twice a week, he had never tried a night march before.

Deploying troops at night was dangerous; it was hard to see the road, easy to be attacked by wild beasts and venomous snakes, and easy to lose one's direction. Lighting torches was practically like being a natural target. Therefore, he had no choice but to wait until daylight the next day to set out, following the Duke's allied forces.

To ensure the success of this operation, the prince decided to join the First Army in the campaign. Of course, compared to the bumpy and buttock-grinding horse riding, he chose to ride on the steamboat, the 'Littletown'.

After half a month of training, Hummingbird was able to control the time of lightening the twelve-pound cannons within a fixed range. Considering the lengthy enchantment process, Roland arranged for her to transform the cannons at dawn, making the first cannon last the longest, with the remaining ones decreasing in duration successively, to ensure that the expiration time of the lightened cannons was as similar as possible.

Thanks to Hummingbird's ability, the 'Littletown' could now carry four cannons and their crews in one trip. The vast cement boat was crowded with people—apart from the artillery team and Roland, those riding on the 'Littletown' included Anna, Nightingale, Nana, Leaf, Echo, Hummingbird, and Titus Pine. Wendy was responsible for providing power, and the helmsman was Brian.

It could be said that, except for Scroll, Soraya, Lily, and Miya, who were not suited for battle, nearly all the witches of Border Town were out. Initially, there was no need for Anna to be on the battlefield, but her determined gaze ultimately made it impossible for Roland to harden his heart and leave her behind.

The land forces were the First Army's gun infantry, led by Chief Knight Carter and Iron Axe, with Lightning undertaking the task of full-time positioning and tracking. The group followed quietly behind the enemy, maintaining just the right distance to stay outside the range of the enemy scouts' patrols. Whenever Lightning detected any scout activity, the army would stop advancing. Along the way, they also captured quite a few scattered mercenaries and freemen, but at that moment, there was no way to deal with these surrendering enemies. They had to disarm them and then have the soldiers who were not assigned guns watch over them, taking them along on the march.

This was also the first time Roland led a "large army" to campaign against the enemy. He stood at the bow of the 'Littletown', feeling the morning breeze blowing against his face, his heart filled with a sense of pride and ambition.

"What are you smiling about?" Anna suddenly appeared beside him and looked up to ask.



"Uh..." Roland instantly put away his smile, "It's nothing."

"Really?" She handed him a handkerchief, "Wipe off your drool."

"..." Roland suddenly felt an urge to jump into the water, "Thank you."

It was sunset when Lightning reported the enemy's encampment. Clearly, after suffering a major defeat, the morale of the allied forces had plummeted to rock bottom. The scouting knights couldn't wait to rush back to camp at dusk, fearful of missing the horse meat served at night.

Roland's troops were stationed on the shore, two kilometers away from the Duke's army.

Having gone undetected on their way here, the annihilation plan was already half successful.

All that was left to do was wait for dawn and complete the encirclement before the enemy set out.

This was also Roland's first time spending the night outdoors. Compared to a campsite crawling with insects, he preferred to sleep on the ship. The wooden shed for storing the artillery was cleared out, and the artillery crew moved into the camp after unloading the twelve-pound cannons, turning the 'Littletown' into the prince's temporary palace. Aside from Roland, the other witches also spent the night on the ship. Everyone spread out their blankets in the shed, lying down shoulder to shoulder fully clothed.

Roland wanted to keep up appearances, but found that the witches cared even less than he did. Except for Anna, they had all suffered a great deal and were used to sleeping in the open during their days of wandering and hardship. In no time, everyone fell asleep, except for Roland and Anna. The former was accustomed to soft beds and found it difficult to adjust to the hard deck bed, while the latter seemed to be lost in thought, constantly gazing at Roland. Whenever the prince turned his head, Anna would quickly close her eyes, pretending to be asleep, but under the moonlight, her eyelashes could still be seen trembling slightly. If not for the fear of disturbing others, Roland really wanted to pinch her delicate nose, forcing her to open her eyes and then take her into his arms.



Thus, the two of them were almost sleepless all night.

Before dawn, Roland launched his grand strategy of dividing his troops and setting an encirclement: two hundred and seventy riflemen were to be split into two groups, one of which would be paired with two cannons and transported to the rear of the Duke's army by the 'First Army', completing their defense setup one kilometer away. Lightning was responsible for monitoring the Duke's movements, and when the flanking group had set up the cannons, the little girl would give a signal. At that moment, the garrison troops led by Carter would begin their frontal assault.

The use of the cement boat for transportation eliminated the possibility of the troops getting scattered during the march, and Nightingale's vision in the fog, which became black and white, could completely function as night-vision equipment. With her as the navigator, the 'First Army' could navigate as well during the day as at night.

This whole process had been practiced repeatedly, and everyone knew what they had to do even with their eyes closed. Wendy expanded the output of the wind, and the 'Littletown' nearly flew through the waves, transporting the troops to the rear in batches. About an hour later, Iron Axe led the interception force into position. Lightning flew over Carter's camp and displayed an orange flag.

At this time, dawn was just breaking.

The encirclement plan officially began.

Since Echo was assigned to combat in the rear, the musketmen responsible for the frontal assault did not need to move. They only needed to form a battle line and protect the two cannons. The twelve-pound cannons were quickly pushed into position and fired at the enemy's camp—at this time, most of the Duke's army was still in their dreams.

With the rumbling sounds of the cannons, the solid cannonballs whistled towards the camp. Knights and mercenaries, startled from their deep slumber, rushed out of their tents only to find the First Army already arrayed in a horizontal line, waiting silently in place. With the experience of the previous day's terrible defeat, no one dared to challenge this seemingly thin line of defense and could only flee in swarms towards the east.

Iron Axe had been waiting in the rear for a long time.



When the enemies appeared in sight, the encirclement plan finally reached the moment to tighten the noose.

With the echo of the marching music, the First Army, 150 strong, marched in two neat rows to the beat of the drum, advancing towards the enemy—to apply pressure on the Duke's army, Iron Axe had to take the initiative to attack. If they held their ground, the enemy, once they came to their senses, might abandon their mounts and escape through the woods.

Duke Ryan had fallen into despair, unable to comprehend how the enemy had appeared behind them.

Admit defeat and surrender? He didn't know how Roland Wimbledon would treat a Duke who had dared to draw his blade against the royal family—it could be imprisonment, exile, or more likely, a direct appointment with the guillotine. Regardless of the outcome, Longsong Stronghold would certainly have nothing to do with him anymore.

Seeing the troops advancing step by step, and the terrifying weapons that intermittently roared and flashed fire behind the enemy, he knew that if he didn't charge now, he would never have the chance to do so again. With only a little more than thirty men left by his side, this was his last opportunity.

"They can't stop us with so few men," the Duke shouted, "As long as we break through their line, they won't be able to catch up with us on foot. We are only half a day's journey from Longsong Stronghold! Knights, charge with me!"

Then the Duke spurred his mount to accelerate, but sadly, not everyone had the spirit to fight to the death. Only about ten men, including his personal guard, followed him in the charge, but he could no longer afford to care about that.

The music came to an abrupt halt.

The opponents stopped their march in unison, standing before him like a wall.



Then he saw those people raise the short sticks in their hands.

As Duke Ryan was only a hundred steps away from the human wall, a series of ping-ping-pong-pong noises rang out continuously. He felt a violent jolt in his chest and abdomen, as if struck by a great hammer. Paralysis and weakness followed, and his body leaned back, falling off the horse onto the ground.

The Duke opened his mouth wanting to say something but no sound came out. He coughed twice, only to smell a strong sweet and fishy odor, and the thick liquid blocked his throat. Darkness soon enveloped him.
