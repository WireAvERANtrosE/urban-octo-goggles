## Dawn Light
After recording the handling method for Pres on paper, Roland put down the quill pen and rubbed his sore neck.

Nightingale's voice rang in his ears, "Your Highness, do you need me to help you relax?"

"There are more than thirty people left to deal with, let's wait a while," Roland said with a smile, shaking his head. He picked up the bell on the table and shook it a few times. The sooner he finished these trivial matters, the sooner he could start the universal education work in Border Town. Moreover, he was full of expectations for the exploration of Anna’s new abilities.

The knight brought into the parlor by the bodyguard was tall and strikingly handsome, no less charming than Carter, who had the face of a male god. Of course, such handsomeness was a negative in Roland's eyes. He glanced at the list, "Phyllis Silt?" Unlike the others, there was a note after the man's name, which he read out loud, "Captain of the Lionheart Knight Order, Dawnlight, the First Knight of the Western Territory... You have quite a lot of titles, don't you?"

"Yes, Your Highness," Phyllis kneeled on one knee.

"I thought that people with ranks like Captain and First Knight would lead the charge on the battlefield," Roland raised an eyebrow, "How did you survive?"

"I hid in the back," he said frankly. "As long as you control the stride of the horse well, it looks like you're sprinting with all your might, but in reality, the horse's speed doesn't increase much."

This straightforward answer surprised Roland; he had expected the other party to make up some excuses to cover up the fact that he was afraid of fighting and fled during the battle. It seemed the situation was not as simple as he had thought.

Sure enough, Phyllis quickly continued, "On the morning of the third day of your pursuit, the day the Duke met his demise, I was following him closely, wanting to find an opportunity to finish him. Unfortunately, he had numerous bodyguards who stayed very close, and I couldn't find a suitable chance to strike. Thankfully, your troops took care of him," the knight said, bowing his head deeply, "Respected Your Highness, I thank you for this and am at your disposal wherever you need me."

The last sentence could be considered an oath of allegiance. Roland was stunned for a moment before he spoke, "Stand up first. Tell me, what exactly happened?"

"Yes," he stood up and said, "My wife, Irene, was originally an ordinary woman working at the theater in Longsong Stronghold. We met by chance and fell in love. I wanted to marry her, but my father and mother did not support the wedding. I had no choice but to move out of my territory and rent a house on a farm near the stronghold, where we held our wedding. Not long after we got married, Irene finally got the chance for her first official performance." The knight's voice grew somber, "Unexpectedly, the Duke watched that play and took a fancy to her. Not long after, while I was away on a mission, he broke into the house and raped Irene."

"It took a long time before she told me about it. I wanted to confront the Duke, but Irene knelt down and begged me not to act rashly. I knew that if I confronted him directly, regardless of the chances of success, even if I killed him, I would not be able to escape from his personal guards, and Irene... might become the target of revenge for Duke Ryan's heir. So, I endured it until he went to Border Town."

"Although I wasn't able to take revenge with my own hands, Irene can finally sleep peacefully, no longer having to worry about someone breaking into her room at night, and I am also freed from this heavy burden. So please allow me to express my gratitude to you once again."

"I see." Roland tapped the desk with his quill, a prearranged signal with Nightingale that if they needed to verify whether the other party was lying, he would tap the desk. Soon he felt a pinch on his left scapula from Nightingale, which meant that the other party was telling the truth... though the pinch was slightly forceful, causing Roland to grin. "Can you read and write?"

"Uh..." Phyllis was taken aback, seemingly not keeping up with the prince's train of thought, "I can do both."

"Then I now make my judgment," Roland announced the oft-repeated words once again, "…what is your choice?"

"Your Highness, do you not need me to fight for you? Whether it's a duel or a group battle, I am—"

"No, I don't," Roland interrupted, "There are no nobles in my army, and I will not recruit nobles in the future. They are an army entirely composed of the people. And you will not have the chance to take up arms again."

"Is... that so?" Phyllis was silent for a long time before she nodded, "I understand. In that case, I choose to become a teacher."
"A wise choice. Teachers can get housing and a fairly good salary. I'll send someone to bring back your wife. Settle down and live well here," Roland made a gesture for the knight to leave.
"Please wait, Your Highness, if I may be so bold to ask," he hesitated, "do you say the same to the other knights? If they cannot become teachers, they have to work in the mines for twenty years?"
"That's right."
"Your Highness, I have a subordinate named Halon, he is an experienced old knight, but he cannot read. Can I use Gold royals to exempt him from being sent to the mines?"
"Of course not," Roland spread his hands, "If money could redeem your crimes, I would have let you go at the fortress."
"But he's almost fifty years old, that kind of sunless labor will break his body."
"He doesn't have the strength to mine but has the energy to attack Border Town?" And my mines are not like the black coal kilns, not only do we have steam engines to help transport the ore and pump water, but the employees also have regular holidays, alright? Roland picked up the bell, ready to call in the next person.
"Your Highness!" Phyllis clenched her teeth and knelt down again, "I have a treasure map passed down in my family, it is at least four hundred years old, I am willing to exchange it for Halon's freedom."

"A four-hundred-year-old treasure map..." the prince said with a frown, "Are you sure it wasn't just something your ancestors drew with charcoal to amuse their descendants?"

"No, it wasn't the trace of charcoal or ink," he shook his head slightly, as if recalling that piece of paper, "I can't say what it was drawn with for certain, the lines are very fine, smooth and soft to the touch. It has been in the basement for several decades, yet the figures and text haven't faded at all. My father said it has been passed down through generations. The location of the treasure it describes is deep within the Misty Forest to the northwest, but that area has become a barbaric land, and ordinary people simply cannot set foot in it."

Roland tapped the table with his goose feather quill, and Nightingale was still pinching on the left side.

"Well, even if what you say is true, that treasure map should still be in the basement of the Silt family, right? You've given up your right to inherit the lands, I'm afraid they won't be too happy to see you."

"That is indeed the case," Phyllis nodded, "However, I have committed the contents of the map to memory. I can roughly sketch out the patterns and text."

"Then let's see you draw it," Roland pushed the pen and paper towards the edge of the table, "If it's real, I might consider granting your request."

"Your Highness is kind." He walked over to the table and began to sketch the treasure map.

In fact, Dawnenlight Phyllis Silt was not only adept at combat, but also had a talent for painting and calligraphy. Soon, a rough topographical map appeared before Roland.

The range indicated by the drawing was behind the Impassable Mountain Range, with a series of mountains from small to large occupying the bottom right corner of the paper. An equilateral triangle was drawn in the center of the paper, with its sharp angles connecting three locations, one at the end of the northern slope of the mountain, another within the Misty Forest, marked by a hexagram, which was probably the so-called treasure location.

But Roland's attention was entirely captivated by the apex of the triangle, located within the Fertile Plains, represented by a jagged mountain peak, with the words written atop it: "Taquila."
