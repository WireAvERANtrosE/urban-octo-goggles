## Dawn's Morning Light
Roland jotted down Primus' treatment method on the paper, set down his quill, and rubbed his sore neck.

The sound of Nightingale's voice rang in his ears, "Your Highness, do you need me to help you relax a bit?"

"There are still more than thirty people to deal with, let's wait a while," Roland replied with a smile and a shake of his head, picking up the bell on the desk and shaking it a few times. Finishing these trifles one day earlier meant that he could start the universal education work in Border Town one day earlier. Moreover, he was full of anticipation for the exploration of Anna's new ability.

The knight brought into the parlor by the guards was tall, and at first glance, he was extraordinarily handsome, not inferior to Carter with his god-like appearance. Of course, such handsomeness was a negative point in Roland's eyes. He glanced at the list, "Philip Eltek?" Unlike the others, there was an additional note after the man's name, which he also read out, "Commander of the Lionheart Knights, Dawnlight, the first knight of the Western Region... you sure have a lot of titles, don't you?"

"Yes, Your Highness," Philip knelt on one knee.

"I thought people like commanders and first knights would always be the first to charge on the battlefield," Roland raised an eyebrow, "How did you survive?"

"I hid in the back," he said frankly. "As long as you control the stride of the horse well, it looks like you're sprinting with all your might, but in reality, the horse's speed doesn't increase by much."

Such a straightforward answer surprised Roland; he had thought the other party would find some excuse to cover up his fear of battle and the fact of fleeing in the face of the enemy. It seemed that things were not as simple as he had thought.

Indeed, Philip quickly continued, "On the morning of the third day of your pursuit, the day the Duke fell, I was following closely behind him, looking for an opportunity to finish him. Unfortunately, he was surrounded by numerous guards, and they stayed close to him, so I could not find a suitable chance to strike. Thankfully, your troops took him down," the knight lowered his head deeply, "Respected Your Highness, I am grateful for this, and am at your disposal for any task you require of me."



The last sentence could be seen as an oath of allegiance. Roland was stunned for a moment before he spoke, "Stand up first. Tell me, what exactly happened?"



"Yes," he stood up and said, "My wife Irene was originally a commoner who worked in the theater of Longsong Stronghold. We met by chance and then fell in love. I wanted to marry her, but my father and mother did not support the wedding. I had no choice but to move out of my territory and rent a house near the stronghold's farm where we held our wedding. Not long after we got married, Irene finally got her chance for a formal performance." The knight's voice was somewhat low, "Unexpectedly, the Duke watched that play and took a liking to her. Not long after, while I was out on a mission, he forced his way into our home and raped Irene."



"It took a long time before I learned about this from her. I wanted to confront the Duke, but Irene knelt down and begged me not to be reckless. I also knew that if I acted on the spot, regardless of the chances of success, even if I killed him, I would not be able to escape from his personal guards, and Irene... would likely become the target of vengeance by Duke Lion's successor. So I held back my anger, until he went to Border Town."



"Although I could not take revenge with my own hands, Irene was finally able to sleep peacefully, no longer having to worry about someone breaking into her room at night, and I was also freed from this heavy burden. So please allow me to express my gratitude to you once again."



"I see." Roland tapped the table with his goose-quill pen, which was a prearranged signal with Nightingale for when they needed to verify if someone was lying; he would tap the table. Soon, he felt a pinch on his left scapula from Nightingale, which meant that the other person was telling the truth... only this pinch was slightly forceful, causing Roland to grin. "Do you know how to read and write?"



"Uh..." Philip was stunned, apparently not keeping up with the prince's train of thought, "I can do both."



"Well, I hereby make my judgment," Roland repeated the words he had declared many times before, "...and your choice is?"



"Your Highness, do you not need me to fight for you? Whether it's a duel or a group battle, I am—"



"No, I do not," Roland interrupted, "There are no nobles in my army, nor will there be in the future. They are an army composed entirely of the people. And you will no longer have the chance to take up arms."



"Is... that so?" Philip remained silent for a long time before nodding, "I understand. In that case, I choose to become a teacher."

"A wise choice. Teachers can get housing and also a fairly good salary. I will send someone to bring back your wife, so you can have a good life here." Roland made a gesture for the knight to leave.

"Please wait, Your Highness, if I may be so bold to ask," he hesitated, "Do you say the same to the other knights? If they cannot become teachers, do they have to go work in the mines for twenty years?"

"That's correct."

"...Your Highness, I have a subordinate named Halon, who is an experienced old knight, but he can't read. Can I use Gold royals to exempt him from being sent to work in the mines?"

"Of course not," Roland spread his hands, "If money could redeem your crimes, I would have let you go at the stronghold."

"But he is nearly fifty years old, that kind of sunless labor will break his body."

"He doesn't have the strength to mine but has the strength to attack Border Town?" And my mines are not like dark coal pits, there are steam engines to help transport the ore and pump water, and the workers even have regular holidays, alright? Roland picked up a bell, ready to call the next person in.

"Your Highness!" Philip clenched his teeth and knelt down again, "I have a treasure map passed down in my family that is at least four hundred years old. I am willing to use it to exchange for Halon's freedom."



"A four hundred-year-old treasure map..." the prince frowned, "are you sure it is not something your ancestor drew with a charcoal pencil just to amuse their descendants?"



"No, it's not the trace of a charcoal pencil or ink," he shook his head slightly, as if recalling that piece of paper, "I can't say what it was drawn with. The lines are very fine, and it feels smooth and soft to the touch. It has been in the basement for several decades, yet the figures and text have not faded at all. My father said it has been passed down from generation to generation. The location of the treasure it describes is deep within the Misty Forest to the northwest, but that area is a wilderness that ordinary people simply cannot set foot in."



Roland tapped the table again with his quill, and Nightingale still pinched on the left side.



"Well, even if what you're saying is true, the treasure map should still be in the Eltek family's basement, shouldn't it? You've given up your right to inherit the territory, I'm afraid they're not too keen on seeing you again."



"That's true," Philip nodded, "But the contents of the map, I have committed them entirely to memory. I can roughly sketch out the patterns and text on it."



"Then draw it out and let's see," Roland pushed paper and pen to the edge of the table, "If it's real, I can make an exception and grant your request."



"Your Highness is merciful." He walked to the edge of the table and began to sketch the treasure map.



In fact, Dawnenlight Philip Eltek was not only adept at fighting, but he was also talented in painting and calligraphy. Soon, a rough topographic map appeared in front of Roland.



The range indicated by the map was behind the Impassable Mountain Range, with a continuous series of mountains from small to large occupying the entire lower right corner of the paper. An equilateral triangle was drawn in the center of the map, with its three sharp angles connecting three locations. One point was at the end of the northern slope of the mountain, another point was in the midst of the Misty Forest, marked with a hexagram—presumably the so-called treasure location.



But Roland's attention was completely drawn to the apex of the triangle, which was located in the Barbarian Land, represented by a jagged mountain peak, with the words written above it: "Taquila."
