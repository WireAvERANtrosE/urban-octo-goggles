## Witch Building
"Awoo, awoo!" Maggie played with her wings and tail in the newly repaired backyard of the castle, spinning around for everyone to admire.



Despite having already learned the details of the event from the witches, Roland was still genuinely shocked when he first saw Maggie in her "demonic beast" form.



This brown-feathered giant bird, including its tail, was ten meters long, with a wingspan close to fifteen meters and flesh wings similar to those of a bat. Against the sunlight, the thin skin's blood vessels and skeleton were clearly visible. Perhaps due to its excessive length, the giant bird had four limbs, each as thick as an adult's arm and ending in claws, all of which it used to support its body.



The most striking feature was its head—three eyes arranged in a triangle on the top and sides of its head, and instead of the common beak of birds, its face was all a gaping maw. When Maggie spoke, her mouth opened and closed, revealing a row of sharp teeth and a long tongue, eliciting a series of gasps from the other witches.



"Is this the mount of a devil?" Leaf exclaimed. "It's a good thing we didn't come across such a monster in the Fertile Plains, or none of us would have escaped."



"If she hadn't evolved a new ability, I'm afraid I wouldn't have made it back either," Nightingale said as she stroked Maggie's smooth neck. "I'll prepare a bag of charcoal-grilled fish fillets for you every day."



"Awoo—!"



"I know, with plenty of honey drizzled on top."



The giant bird's tail wagged even more cheerfully now.

All those dried fish were obviously mine, Roland sighed to himself. Rewarding others with food from the kitchen without asking and making it sound so righteous!

"Then let's follow the old rules and test your new abilities."

"Alright, awoo!"

...

After a morning of trials, Roland obtained a detailed understanding of Maggie's new beast form abilities.

Following the previous pattern of enlargement, the brown-skinned giant bird she transformed into was even larger than the original version ridden by devils, and its carrying capacity had slightly increased, allowing it to carry two witches into the sky at the same time. However, when fully loaded, the flight speed could only be maintained at around eighty kilometers per hour, which was much slower compared to Lightning.

But Maggie's advantage was her endurance. When Lightning carried heavy loads, not only would her altitude decrease, but her magic power consumption would also increase. In contrast, once the giant bird transformation was complete, regardless of flying high or low, carrying one or two, the magic power expenditure was extremely slow, with the only concern being her own physical strength.

Now, the magic power contained within Maggie had also grown significantly, leaping from one of the lowest ranks in the Witch Union to a medium level, allowing for enough power to transform seven or eight times in a single day.



Besides that, Roland also confirmed his previous speculation through Maggie.



A witch's evolution depends on her understanding of her own abilities, whether that understanding comes through learning and mastering or sudden enlightenment, either can lead to a change in abilities.



This also means that witches have the potential for natural evolution—as long as there is enough time, there will always be one or two lucky ones among them who stand out. The abilities after evolution are completely different from the initial abilities, and they can even achieve miraculous effects from decay. Is this the reason why the Church is fully suppressing the wild witches?



After lunch, a significant event took place in the lord's castle area.



The Witch Building, after nearly four months of construction and decoration, was finally ready to be put into use.



Roland gazed at the three-story residential building with less than fifty suites and couldn't help but marvel. In his future world, such a house would at most be considered a self-built level in the countryside, but here, it represented the highest building technology level of the continental kingdoms—not in terms of size, but in terms of technology.



It was the first building to use bamboo-reinforced concrete beams and columns in a brick-concrete structure.



Karl had been emotionally touched when he poured the first concrete column, telling Roland, "So cement can be used in this way. Mixed with pebbles, it can be shaped into any form you desire and make up any part of a house... Your Highness, I think it won't be long before the stonemason trade might completely disappear from construction."



Apart from the beams and columns, the floor slabs of the Witch Building were all made of precast concrete slabs. Looking at those slabs with round holes distributed in the middle, Roland felt as if he had returned to his childhood—only those born after the 1980s had seen such ancient building materials. By the time he was in his teens, they had been completely replaced by cast-in-place concrete floor slabs, abandoned by the times.



In Border Town, this "backward" prefabricated panel was given new life once again.

The Witch Building was situated to the left of the castle, forming an "L" shape with it. The open space enclosed by the two buildings, even after the expansion of the large garden, had its area increased by three to four times the original size, which was sufficient for Leaf to improve various crops and fruits.



...



Evelyn, who had moved into the new house, was somewhat anxious.

Having been in Border Town for a month, it seemed that besides tasting wine for His Highness, she hadn't done anything else. She also scored the lowest among the witches in the last test, with only five points... Although Teacher Scroll didn't announce the scores publicly, such things could easily be guessed with a little private inquiry.

Even Maggie, who couldn't speak in complete sentences, got sixty-one points!

She suddenly felt that she was no different from a fool.

Even so, His Highness didn't treat her any differently and still occasionally asked her to discuss the special liquors from various places. They would then taste the newly produced fiery white liquor, and at the end of last month, she even received a salary of one Gold Royal. This only added to her unease—compared to the other four, she felt as if she was just freeloading.



"There's actually a kitchen specially for cooking next to the living room, and there's this strange little room painted white, come and see." Candle excitedly pushed open the bedroom door and said.



"Um..." Evelyn responded weakly.



"What's wrong, feeling unwell?" Candle heaved a sigh and squatted down to touch her forehead, "You don't have a fever." She then chuckled and said, "Could it be that you're reluctant to sleep in a bed with the sisters from the United Witches Association?"



Evelyn was silent for a moment before murmuring, "We've been here for over a month now, haven't we?"



"About that."



"Lian is almost finished with the new city wall project, Honey has trained a bunch of flight messengers for His Highness, and Sylvie has even accompanied His Highness to scout those terrifying monsters," she said despondently, "Only I am still idle, without any training arrangements and with the worst assessment results... I really don't know why His Highness chose to bring me here."



"Um," Candle pondered for a while, "Why don't you go and ask him yourself?"



"Ah?"



"Roland is Lady Tilly's brother, and as you've seen, he truly treats witches with sincerity. Even Sylvie, who always used to say 'stay away from Roland, beware of the prince', has changed her tune. Just yesterday, she couldn't help but praise him twice," Candle shrugged her shoulders, "If you ask His Highness directly, it's not like he can eat you, right?"



Is that so? Now that she mentioned it, it did seem to make some sense.



Evelyn thought for a moment, and in order not to be tormented by this agony any longer, she decided to do as the candle had said.
