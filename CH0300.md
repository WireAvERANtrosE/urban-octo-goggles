## Witch Building
"Awoo, Awoo!" Maggie flapped her wings and tail in the newly repaired castle's backyard, twirling around for everyone to admire.



Even though Roland had already heard about the incident from the witches, when he first saw Maggie in her "demonic beast form," he was still genuinely shocked.



This brown-feathered giant bird was about ten meters long including its tail, with a wingspan close to fifteen meters, resembling that of a bat's fleshy wings. Against the sunlight, one could clearly see the blood vessels and skeleton beneath its thin skin. Perhaps due to its elongated body, the giant bird had four limbs, each similar in thickness to a human arm, ending in claws, all used to support its body.



The most eye-catching part was the creature's head—three eyes arranged in a triangle on its forehead and sides, and instead of a common bird's beak, its entire face was a gaping maw. When Maggie spoke, her mouth opened and closed, revealing a ring of sharp teeth and a long tongue, causing the other witches to let out a series of exclamations.



"So this is a devil's mount?" Leaf exclaimed, "It's a good thing we didn't encounter such monsters in the Fertile Plains, or none of us would have escaped."



"If she hadn't evolved a new ability, I might not have been able to return," Nightingale said, stroking Maggie's smooth neck, "I'll prepare a bag of charcoal-baked fish fillets for you every day."



"Awoo—!"



"I know, with extra honey drizzled on top."



The giant bird's tail wagged even more cheerfully.

All those dried fish were clearly mine, Roland sighed to himself. Rewarding others with food from the kitchen without permission, don't make it sound so high and mighty!

"Then let's follow the old rules and test your new abilities."

"Alright, awoo!"

...

After a morning of exertion, Roland obtained a detailed account of Maggie's variant beast abilities.

Following the previous pattern of enlargement, the brown-skinned giant bird she transformed into was even larger than the original version ridden by demons, and its carrying capacity had slightly increased, allowing it to take two witches into the sky at once. However, when fully loaded, the flying speed could only be maintained at around eighty kilometers per hour, which was much slower compared to Lightning.

But Maggie's advantage lay in her endurance. When Lightning carried heavy objects in flight, not only would her altitude decrease, but her magic power consumption would also increase, whereas the giant bird, once transformed, consumed magic power very slowly regardless of the altitude or whether it carried one or two passengers. The only consideration was her own physical strength.

Now, the amount of magic power contained within Maggie had also significantly increased, leaping from one of the lowest ranks in the Witch Union to a moderate level, enough for about seven or eight transformations in a day.



In addition to that, Roland also confirmed his previous speculation through Maggie.

A witch's evolution depended on her understanding of her own abilities, whether this understanding was achieved through learning or sudden enlightenment, both could lead to a transformation of power.

This also meant that witches had the potential for natural evolution—as long as there was enough time, one or two lucky ones among them would stand out. The evolved abilities compared to the initial abilities were like heaven and earth, even with effects that could turn decay into magic. Was this the reason why the Church was so determined to suppress wild witches?



After lunch, a major event took place in the lord's castle district.

The Witch Building, after nearly four months of construction and decoration, was finally ready for use.

Roland looked at the three-story residential building with less than fifty suites and couldn't help but marvel. In modern times, such a house would at best be considered a self-built building in the countryside. But here, it represented the highest level of architectural technology in the continent's kingdoms—not in scale, but in technique.

It was the first building to use bamboo-reinforced concrete beams and columns in its brick-concrete structure.

Roland remembered Karl being overwhelmed with emotions when he poured the first concrete column, "So this is how cement can be used. Mixed with pebbles, it can be shaped into any form at will to construct any part of a house... Your Highness, I think it won't be long before the stonemason trade might completely disappear from construction."

Apart from the beams and columns, the floor slabs of the Witch Building were all made of prefabricated concrete slabs. Looking at those slabs with round holes distributed in the middle, Roland felt as if he had returned to his childhood—only those born in the post-80s had seen such ancient building materials. By the time he was in his teens, they had been completely replaced by cast-in-place concrete slabs, thoroughly discarded by the times.



In Border Town, this "backward" prefabricated paneling had once again been given new life.

The Witch Building was situated to the left of the castle, forming an "L" shape with it. The open space enclosed by the two buildings, even after the expansion of the large garden, had increased in size by three or four times, providing ample room for Leaf to improve various crops and fruits.

...

Evelyn, who had moved into the new house, felt somewhat uneasy.

It had been a month since she came to Border Town, and it seemed that besides tasting wines for His Highness, she hadn't done anything else. In the last test, she had scored the lowest among the witches, with only five points... Although Teacher Scroll didn't announce the scores publicly, one could easily guess by asking around privately.

Even Maggie, who couldn't speak properly, had scored sixty-one points!

She suddenly felt that she wasn't much different from an idiot.

Even so, His Highness didn't treat her any differently, still occasionally inviting her to discuss and taste the special liquors from various places, and even try the newly made fiery vodka. At the end of last month, she had even received a salary of one Gold royal. This only increased her sense of unease—compared to the other four, she felt as though she was just freeloading.

"There's even a kitchen specifically for cooking next to the living room, and a strange little room painted white, come and see." Candle excitedly pushed open the bedroom door and said.



"Mmm..." Evelyn replied weakly.



"What’s wrong, feeling unwell?" Candle asked in surprise, squatting down to touch her forehead. "It's not hot." She then smiled and said, "Could it be that you're reluctant to sleep in the same bed as your sisters from the Union?"



Evelyn was silent for a moment before she spoke softly, "We've been here for over a month now, haven't we?"



"About that."



"Lily is in charge of the new city wall construction that will soon be completed, Honey has trained a large number of flying messengers for His Highness, and Sylvie has even accompanied His Highness to scout those terrifying monsters," she said disheartenedly, "Only I still have nothing to do, not even assigned regular training tasks, and my assessment results are still the worst... I really don't know why His Highness chose me to come here."



"Hmm," Candle pondered for a moment, "Why don’t you ask him yourself?"



"Ah?"



"Roland is Lady Tilly's brother, and as you've seen, he truly treats witches with sincerity. Even Sylvie, who used to always say 'stay away from Roland, beware of the prince,' has changed her tune. She couldn't help but praise him yesterday," Candle shrugged, "If you ask His Highness face to face, he surely won't eat you, right?"



Is that so? Now that she mentioned it, it did seem to make some sense.



Evelyn pondered for a moment and, in order not to be tormented by this ordeal any longer, she decided to do as Candle had suggested.
