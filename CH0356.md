## "152!"
A weapon that allows ordinary people to defeat extraordinary witches?

After Wendy left, Agatha had been pondering over this sentence. Did they really know what an extraordinary person was?

It was just a pity that she didn't have a God's Stone of Retaliation on hand, otherwise, she would have been able to clearly understand the magic power and type of these people.

Just when she was becoming impatient, Nightingale appeared at the door of her room, "His Highness invites you to observe the new weapon's test firing. If you do not wish to go—"

"I will go," she said gravely. "Please lead the way."

Seeing Prince Roland with a sleepy face, yawning, Agatha suddenly had the urge to throw a faceful of ice chips at him, to make him properly wake up. However, this kind of action that could easily cause misunderstandings among the other witches, ultimately remained just a thought in her heart.

Once out of the castle, it was the first time she had seen the full view of this small town during the day.

Against the backdrop of the heavy snow, the first impression that came to mind was neatness—the tidy, double-story houses stood side by side, all of the same shape and size, with their white outlines and red brick gabled roofs looking exceptionally harmonious. The black streets were all straight, dividing the town into blocks of similar size. Looking out from near to far, the view consisted of a cycle of buildings, trees, streets, trees, streets, as if they were layers stacked upon one another.

Even Tassia, the inner city, could not achieve such neatness and order!



However, what made her feel a bit of consolation was that, aside from the castle, there were no other buildings in this small town worth a second glance—not even the castle itself, which was far less impressive than the Seeker's High Tower in Taquila.

It was just a small town after all, Agatha thought disdainfully, and turned her head to Nightingale, "How many people live here?"

"Um... there were just over two thousand at the beginning, but now with refugees from the north and south, it's nearly thirty thousand, I guess."

Two thousand people daring to say they'll defeat the demons is nothing but a fool's talk—wait, thirty... thirty thousand? Agatha's eyes widened. Taquila at its peak had only accommodated fifty thousand people, and this tiny place could have thirty thousand residents? She couldn't be including the population of the surrounding villages as well, could she?

Though these square brick houses do indeed seem to accommodate more inhabitants than wooden huts, an increase in population was not just a simple stacking of numbers. Once the population exceeds a certain limit, the demands on the city grow exponentially. First is the drastic increase in the need for food and drinking water, followed by the expansion of slums and deteriorating public security, and then even the disposal of human waste becomes a thorny issue.

During the late stages of the Second Battle of Divine Will, Taquila faced such problems—as major cities fell one after another, the number of people flooding into the Holy City surged, and the overburdened population not only failed to strengthen the city's defenses but almost brought the entire city to a halt, until the Union forcibly cleared out a batch of refugees and stabilized the situation.

Having experienced this firsthand, Agatha knew the difficulties of expanding a city's population. Seeing Nightingale's casual demeanor, she was skeptical—perhaps Nightingale didn't know the answer and was just trying to placate her.

She thought it better to consult Wendy on such matters in the future, as at least the latter seemed more sincere.

Passing through the bustling streets, Agatha followed the prince and others onto a section of the city wall built from mud. These low walls had nothing to do with being towering or sturdy; the walls lacked barbs, and there was no moat surrounding them. Demons wouldn't even need siege equipment; they could simply climb over using their hands and feet.



Her disappointment deepened.

Every hundred steps or so, the city wall had a protruding platform, wider than the rest, which seemed to be designed for mounting catapults. It didn't take long for Agatha to spot the object of the test as she walked along the top of the wall.

The shape of the weapon was so unusual that it was hard to ignore its presence.

It was a long, metal tube, somewhat resembling an iron spear enlarged several times, yet without a spear point. Its surface was smooth, with a silvery-grey color that didn't seem like it was made of iron. The rear end of the tube was more complex, with a fixed stand and two shorter tubes attached above and below the main one, with neither ropes nor a groove for arrows. From the outside, it didn't look like a larger version of a ballista or trebuchet.

But she also couldn't figure out how the thing was supposed to attack the enemy.

"This is Border Town's latest weapon, the 152mm fortress standard cannon, symbolizing justice and glory!" the prince gestured, "Compared to the twelve-pound field gun, it has many improvements, outstanding indicators in all categories, and can definitely be called a revolutionary weapon!"

Agatha frowned, what justice and glory, fortress standard—it all sounded frivolous. The string of introductions that followed was incredibly awkward, clearly a bunch of made-up jargon. Was he really the knowledgeable and talented prince that Wendy spoke of, the one deeply trusted by the witches?

"Clap clap clap." Nightingale was the only one applauding, making the atmosphere somewhat stiff for a moment.

"Ahem," Roland cleared his throat, "So without further ado, let's proceed with the firing test. Iron Axe, begin."



"Yes, Your Highness." The three people dressed in uniform immediately sprang into action.

Agatha stood by the side, not taking her eyes off their every movement, hoping to figure out the working principle of this weapon.

One of them slid a metal block down at the end of the long barrel, and another swiftly stuffed an orange-yellow pointed object into the tube, then closed the metal block.

"Report, preparation complete, ready to fire!"

"Everyone cover your ears," the prince demonstrated and nodded, "Fire."

Wait... it's ready so quickly? Just as Agatha was about to ask, a thunderous boom suddenly exploded beside her ear! Her head buzzed instantly, and the surroundings fell into a sudden silence. A burst of orange-red flames spewed from the front of the metal barrel, dazzling yet brief. In that moment, she felt the immense power contained within the flames. The city wall beneath her seemed to quiver, and a wave of heat rushed towards her, making her nearly lose her footing and take two steps back. The cannon itself lurched backward forcefully—but it quickly stabilized back to its original position.

"—" Nightingale supported her from behind, appearing to say something, but she could only hear intermittent whispers, as if coming from a great distance... until the buzzing sound gradually faded and her hearing returned to normal, "Are you alright?"

She shook her head and shifted her gaze towards the open snowy field ahead, but she saw no changes.

Could it be that this burst of flames was merely to intimidate the enemy?



"Have you spotted the landing point?" the prince asked the witch with green hair beside him.

"It landed behind a small hill, the closest marker is the red flag," the latter looked around for a while, "but it's still quite far away."

Red flag? Agatha looked at Roland with confusion. What were they talking about?

Fortunately, His Highness the Prince soon cleared up her confusion. "This weapon can launch projectiles—you can think of them as crossbow bolts—at distant enemies. To observe the range of the bombardment, I had Lightning place colored flags every thousand meters. The red flag is the last one, standing five thousand meters away," he explained. "In terms of the units you're familiar with, a thousand meters is roughly three hundred zhang, close to two li."

Agatha stood there, stunned. Did he mean to say that the bolt they had just loaded was sent ten li away? There were no ropes or tension mechanisms, how did it do that? Even siege beasts powered by magic could only launch projectiles three to four li at most. If he wasn't lying, then by building a tall, sturdy wall and pairing it with this weapon, they could effectively halt the advance of the demons.

But... such an astonishingly long-range weapon, it must not be easy to fire.

"Feeling like something is missing when you can't see where the projectile lands," the prince stroked his chin, "Next, let's test firing three rounds rapidly in flat trajectory to hit close-range targets."
