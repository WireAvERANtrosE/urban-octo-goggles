## Assassination (Part 1)
The Faceless One had stealthily crossed the canal before the sun had completely set, circling around towards the back of the mercenary camp.

Her real name was not the Faceless One, but rather, Afra—this was the name given to her by Bishop Heather of the Holy City of Hermes, meaning "dust." She was very fond of this name because dust, being plain and unadorned, once settled on the ground, could no longer be distinguished from one another, just like herself.

It was only in front of Heather that Afra would revert to her original appearance.

As a member of the Tribunal, she had assisted the bishop in dealing with many fallen ones, including witches who had betrayed the Church and believers corrupted by the secular world. Being dispatched to the capital was for a critical mission: to convert a devout High Judge into the King of Greycastle. As for capturing the fallen witches, that was just a side task. She enjoyed imitating those witches who had been subjected to torture and punishment, experiencing it all from start to finish, to share in the pain of the fallen ones. This allowed her to feel more profoundly the significance of everything she did, and it also served as atonement for her possession of devilish powers.

The opponents' camp was cleverly set up, located in a raised field by the shore, difficult to observe from below, and the flying witches in the sky made it risky for her to get too close. Afra had no choice but to hide in a farm warehouse, waiting for nightfall to act.

When the night enveloped the land, she unexpectedly noticed a change.

The mercenaries had withdrawn from the dock area, all retreating back into the camp, and those fools with the sleeping potions were sparsely gathered with torches by the riverbank—as if to announce to the other side, "Someone is about to attack the camp." Even without flying witches, any mercenary group that wasn't completely blind could tell something was amiss with just a glance.

This is bad, she thought to herself, if the other side concluded that the Rat People were too numerous and there was no chance of winning, they would definitely retreat to the east. Although marching at night was greatly frowned upon, clearly, they would not care about such matters when fleeing for their lives. They would scatter in all directions, and at this moment, not even a shadow of the encirclement was to be seen—the sleeping potion carriers had just taken the docks and were still slowly crossing the river by those few rafts on the shore. By the time they surrounded the camp, the enemies would have long scattered. Expecting the Rat People to pursue the enemy in the night was impossible, and where would she find those damned witches then?

Afra hurried towards the camp, hoping to blend into the troops before their retreat.



However, when she hurried near the mercenary gathering area, the scene before her eyes was completely unexpected.

People were still patrolling around the camp, the bonfires were burning fiercely, and figures were coming and going in an orderly manner, without any disorder.

Had they actually not chosen to retreat?

After careful observation for a while, Ashes confirmed her judgment and felt a surge of secret joy. Although she did not know why the other party had decided to stay instead of fleeing quickly, the outcome was already destined. She took out a dagger from her waist, observed the movements of the sentries, and stealthily approached the weakest spot.

In addition to giving her a meaning to live, Lady Alice also taught her the skills of combat and assassination. The opponent was not a battle-hardened elite mercenary, which was evident from the arrangement of the sentry points. She took advantage of the moment when a mercenary was looking elsewhere, quickly pounced on him from a blind spot, covered his mouth with one hand, and stabbed the dagger into his neck with the other.

After silently killing the mercenary, Ashes pressed down on the body with one hand and placed the other on her chest to activate her transformation ability—this was a process that could be long or short: when replacing the king, to ensure a long-lasting effect, she had almost exhausted all the magic power in her body, and the transformation lasted nearly half an hour. However, at this moment, there was no need to put in so much effort, and in the blink of an eye, she transformed herself into the appearance of the mercenary, even though the effect could only be maintained for half a day, it was enough for assassination.

Before the patrol team came back around, she quickly stripped off the mercenary's clothes and put them on herself, at the same time dragging the body into the wheat field. Only when facing the mercenary's weapon did she feel a bit puzzled—it was an iron gun barrel with a wooden handle, but instead of a spearhead, there was a dark little hole at the end.

What kind of weapon was this?

She thought for a long time but couldn't come up with an answer. Seeing that the patrol team was about to pass by, Ashes had no choice but to carry it on her back according to the appearance she remembered, pretending to be seriously on guard.



Just like numerous assassination attempts before, the patrol passed by her without noticing anything out of the ordinary.

Aphra was not in a hurry to return to the camp to find the witch's whereabouts. After all, the Replacement Technique could only simulate appearance, not read minds. If she encountered someone familiar, it would be very easy to give herself away. She would wait until the enemy's formation was in complete disarray, as there would be countless opportunities to strike at her leisure.

When the moon hung high in the night sky, the fools of Dreamwater finally crossed the canal and started to move towards this side. Meanwhile, the sound of whistles behind her indicated that the patrolling and sentry mercenaries were starting to withdraw back to the camp—her opportunity had arrived.

Following the crowd into the camp, Aphra was surprised to find that the enemy numbered far more than a hundred. They formed a long circle around the top of the small hill, either crouching or standing, with the strange weapons in their hands raised horizontally—the end with a hole pointing towards the enemy.

She didn't have time to look closely. Taking advantage of the fact that no one around was paying attention, she bent down and crawled into the nearest tent.

Soon after, shouts and killings erupted outside, followed by a more intense series of explosions. Aphra was startled by the noise, which was so dense that there was hardly any pause.

What on earth was happening? She suppressed the urge to poke her head out to see for herself and waited quietly.

As time passed, the camp became busy with footsteps and orders everywhere. They were probably adjusting the defensive forces according to the number of attackers. What made Aphra anxious was why, after so long, they had not managed to take the top of the hill!

After a while, the clanging sounds gradually thinned out, and she could no longer hear the sounds of the rats fighting—this made Aphra's heart sink. Could it be... that the scum of Dreamwater had already retreated? Even if the number of mercenaries doubled, it would only be two to three hundred, yet the thousands of rats converging from all directions couldn't even set foot on the hilltop?



Opportunities seemed to be slipping away from her.



Afra made a split-second decision and crawled out of the tent, heading towards the center of the camp—once the battle was over, and it was time to account for everyone, it would be hard to escape the watchful eyes of the others. This was not a well-prepared infiltration. She was unfamiliar with the mercenary group's personnel and passwords, so she had to act quickly.



After bypassing two tents, Afra slowly peeked out, gazing towards the center of the camp. Around the bonfire sat four women, probably the witches mentioned in the intelligence. Although the number did not match, the damned intelligence had never been accurate from the start. Moreover, there wasn't much difference between killing two or four; any suspected Fallen should be subjected to interrogation. When there was no time for interrogation, they should all be killed, and even if it was a mistake, it was a necessary sacrifice.



She looked around to plan her escape route, then stood up from behind the tent and walked casually towards the bonfire.



As soon as she stepped into the clearing, Afra felt a cold, hard object pressed against the back of her head.



"Don't move," a woman's voice said, "Who exactly are you?"
