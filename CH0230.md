## Assassination (Part 1)
The Faceless had quietly crossed the canal before the sun had completely set, and was circling around towards the back of the mercenary camp.



Her real name was not the Faceless; it was Ashes—this was the name given to her by Bishop Heather of the Holy City of Hermes, meaning dust. She liked this name very much because, like dust, it was plain and unadorned; once it settled on the ground, it was indistinguishable from each other, just like her.



It was only in front of Heather that Ashes would revert to her original appearance.



As a member of the Judgment Army, she had assisted the bishop in dealing with many fallen ones, including witches who had betrayed the church and believers corrupted by the secular world. She had been dispatched to the royal capital to complete a critical mission: to convert a devout chief inquisitor into the King of Greycastle. As for capturing fallen witches, that was just a side activity she enjoyed; she liked to mimic those witches who suffered punishment and torture, experiencing their ordeal from start to finish. Sharing the pain of the fallen allowed her to profoundly feel the significance of her actions and served as atonement for possessing the power of devils.



The opponent's camp was cleverly set up, right in the middle of a field that rose from the shore. It was difficult to observe their movements from below, and the presence of witches flying in the sky prevented her from getting too close. Ashes had no choice but to hide in a farm warehouse, waiting for darkness to act.



When night enveloped the earth, she unexpectedly noticed a change.



The mercenaries had already withdrawn from the dock area, all retreating back into the camp, while those fools with the Dream Water were actually gathered around the riverbank with torches in hand—a formation that practically screamed to the enemy, "Someone is about to attack the camp." Even without the flying witches, anyone in the mercenary group who wasn't blind would realize something was amiss with a single glance.



This is bad, she thought to herself, if the enemy realizes that the rat people are numerous and there is no chance of victory, they will definitely retreat to the east. Although marching at night was greatly frowned upon, when fleeing for their lives, they clearly wouldn't care about that and would just scatter. At the moment, there wasn't even a shadow of the encirclement—the Dream Water had just taken over the dock and was still crossing the river slowly using those few rafts by the shore. By the time they surrounded the enemy, the latter would have most likely already dispersed. It was impossible for the rat people to pursue the enemy at night; where would she find those damned witches then?



Ashes hurried towards the camp, hoping to blend into their ranks before they retreated.



However, when she arrived near the mercenary camp, the scene before her was completely unexpected.

There were still patrols around the camp, the bonfires were burning vigorously, figures were coming and going, and everything seemed orderly, not at all in chaos.

Had they actually chosen not to retreat?

After careful observation, Agatha confirmed her judgment and felt a surge of secret delight. Although she did not know why they had decided to stay instead of fleeing as quickly as possible, the outcome was now certain. She took a dagger from her waist, watched the movements of the sentries, and crept towards the weakest spot.

Apart from giving her a reason to live, Lady Hester had also taught her combat and assassination skills. The opponent was not a battle-hardened elite mercenary, as could be seen from the arrangement of the sentry points. She took advantage of a moment when a mercenary was looking elsewhere, crouched down from the blind spot of his vision, and quickly pounced on him from behind, one hand covering his mouth and the other stabbing the dagger into his neck.

After silently killing the mercenary, Agatha pressed down on him with one hand and placed the other on her chest, activating her transformation ability—this could be a lengthy or brief process: when replacing the King, to ensure a long-lasting effect, she had almost exhausted all her magic power, and the transformation took nearly half an hour. But now, there was no need for such effort; in the blink of an eye, she had transformed herself into the appearance of the mercenary, and although the effect could only last half a day, it was enough for an assassination.

Before the patrol could return, she quickly stripped off the man's clothes, put them on herself, and dragged the body into the wheat field. However, when she faced the mercenary's weapon, she was somewhat baffled—it was an iron gun barrel with a wooden handle, but instead of a spike at the end, there was a dark little hole.

What kind of weapon was this?

She thought for a long time but couldn't come up with an answer. Seeing that the patrol was about to pass by, Agatha had no choice but to carry it on her back as she remembered it and pretended to be seriously keeping watch.



As with countless assassination attempts before, the patrol brushed past her without noticing anything amiss.

Afrah didn't rush back to the camp to look for the witches' whereabouts. After all, the Transfiguration spell could only mimic appearances and not read thoughts. If she encountered someone familiar, she would easily give herself away. She would have plenty of opportunities to strike when the enemies were in disarray.

When the moon hung high in the night sky, the fools of the Dream World finally crossed the canal and moved towards this side. Meanwhile, the sound of whistles came from behind her, signaling that the patrolling and sentry mercenaries were retreating back to the camp—her chance had arrived.

Following the crowd into the camp, Afrah was surprised to find that there were far more than a hundred people. They formed a long circle around the top of the small hill, either squatting or standing, holding those strange weapons with the hollow end facing the enemy.

She didn't have time to look closely. While no one was paying attention, she bent down and slipped into the nearest tent.

Before long, shouts and killing cries erupted outside, followed by a more intense barrage of blasts. Afrah was startled by the sounds, which were so dense they hardly ceased.

What on earth was happening? She suppressed the impulse to peek out and see, and waited calmly.

As time passed, the camp became busy with footsteps and commands everywhere, probably adjusting the defense forces according to the number of attackers. What made Afrah anxious was, why hadn't they taken the hilltop after so long?

After a while, the clanging and banging sounds gradually thinned out, and she could no longer hear the sounds of the rats fighting—Afrah's heart sank. Could it be that the scum of the Dream World had already retreated? Even if the number of mercenaries doubled, there would only be two to three hundred people. How could the thousand-odd rats surrounding from all sides fail to set foot on the hilltop even once?



Opportunity seemed to be slipping away from her.

Afra decisively crawled out of the tent and made her way toward the center of the camp—once the battle was over and it was time to count heads, it would be difficult for her to escape the eyes of everyone. This was not a well-prepared infiltration; she was not familiar with the mercenary group's personnel or their passwords, so she had to act swiftly and decisively.

After circling around two tents, Afra slowly poked her head out, looking toward the center of the camp. She saw four women sitting around the campfire, probably the witches mentioned in the intelligence report. Although the numbers did not match, the damned intelligence had never been accurate to begin with, and there wasn't a big difference between killing two or four. Any suspected Fallen One should be subjected to interrogation. If there wasn't time for interrogation, then they should all be killed, and even if it was a mistake, it was a necessary sacrifice.

She looked around to plan her escape route, then stood up from behind the tent and walked nonchalantly towards the campfire.

As soon as she stepped into the open space, Afra felt something cold and hard press against the back of her head.

"Don't move," a woman's voice said, "Who are you exactly?"
