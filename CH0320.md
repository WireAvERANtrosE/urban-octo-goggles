## "Sleeping Spell"
Fjords, Sleeping Island.

"I never expected that the first guest of 'Sleeping Spell' would be you," Tilly said with a smile, handing over a cup of steaming fish soup, "I owe you one for your help in exploring the relics of the Shadow Islands."

"You flatter me," Thunder took the fish soup, "As for that mysterious sea area, I would be willing to visit it several times even without a commission. Honestly, if it weren't for the company of witches, the area east of the Shadow Islands would absolutely be a dangerous no-go zone for explorers." He took a sip of the fish soup and couldn't help but exhale a breath of warmth, "Ah... soup made from black-tailed fish, it's really delicious."



Tea and beer were not popular in the fjords; people were accustomed to having a bowl of cold fish jelly in the peak of summer and a cup of boiling fish soup as it turned cold. Different kinds of fish all resulted in different flavors, this was a custom Tilly gradually came to understand after arriving at Sleeping Island.



"So you couldn't wait to patronize 'Sleeping Spell'?" 



"To be precise, I can't wait to embark on the next adventure," Thunder laughed heartily, "The scene I saw in the ruins' lookout mirror last time was astounding—what's on that land, why there's a stone door on the cliff face, I'm dying to fly over there and see for myself."



"Is that so..." Tilly also poured herself a cup of fish soup, "You should know, I plan to personally make a trip to Border Town. I want to have a good talk with the Lord of the Mutual Aid Society, and also take the opportunity to witness the Western Region's Evil Months. Won't you... come with us and have a look?"



He was silent for a moment, then grinned and said, "Better not, she should be doing fine there, and that's good... After all, with adventuring, accidents can happen any day. I've lost her mother, I don't want to lose her too. When the time comes, please..."



"I will," Tilly nodded, "After all, she is one of us," she said with a slight smile, "But business is business. Despite the fact that you've helped us a lot, the price for hiring a witch still has to go by the book."



"Of course, business is business, and that is the tradition of the Fjords." Thunder laughed heartily after downing his fish soup in one gulp.

...

"So, which ones did he hire?" Ashes walked into the hall from outside after Thunder left the royal palace and sat down cross-legged beside Tilly.

"The 'Magic Servant' Molly, 'Door of All' Echo, and 'Puppet' Shadow." Tilly spread out the contracts, "The final cost was set at four thousand eight hundred Gold Royals. Quite a generous return, wouldn't you say?"

"Four thousand..." Ashes opened her mouth in shock, "Where did he get so much money?"

"Don't forget, Thunder is the most famous explorer in the Fjords," Princess Tilly said with a light smile, "Whether it's discovering new sea routes or unearthing treasures from various places, all of it brings him a fortune. It's precisely because of this that he has the ability to recruit large groups of experienced sailors time and again to accompany him on his explorations of those mysterious and dangerous areas. But with witches, the risks he takes are greatly reduced. Using money to offset risks has always been a good deal since ancient times."

"But is this really okay?" Ashes hesitated, "Establishing a Bounty Guild could indeed bring a lot of wealth to Sleeping Island, but the witches' abilities would also be exposed, and if the Church gets wind of it..."

'The Sleeping Spell' was a brand-new guild established by Tilly. Here, explorers from the Fjord Islands could hire witches with the right abilities to help them with their adventures. Of course, besides the main services, they also offered many convenient services, such as repairing damaged items, creating exquisite artworks, rapid house construction, gardening, and pest control— as long as it wasn't using the witches' abilities for evil, 'The Sleeping Spell' would take on the job.

Of course, all of this was predicated on making their abilities known.



Tilly took Ashes' hand, "Haven't I told you before? What I care about is not those Gold Royals, but rather the hope that through the Bounty Hunter's Guild, more people will come to know of Sleeping Island and form close relations with us. There's a saying from Thunder that I agree with, 'Fear comes from the unknown,' and the same is true for witches. The fear of witches from the islanders of the Fjords and the residents of the Kingdom stems from the Church's slander and their own ignorance."



"I can't force them to take the initiative to contact and understand witches, so I can only actively promote ourselves, telling them that this is not the power of devils, and the abilities of witches are not as mysterious and unpredictable as they think—they awaken among ordinary people and are essentially still members of humanity. As understanding between us grows, such fear will no longer exist." She paused, then continued, "As for the Church, they never care about our abilities. Capturing witches has always been the responsibility of the Witch Hunters, and occasionally, the God's Punishment Army is deployed. Any ability doesn't make much difference in front of the Divine Stone of Judgement."



"I hope you're right," Ashes said softly, "I can only fight and kill; I can't be of much help to you in this regard."



"You've already helped me a lot," Tilly smiled, "The most important thing for the development and growth of Sleeping Island is to connect with the Fjord Islands. Mutual understanding is a process, and what I'm doing is just to shorten this process as quickly as possible. Moreover, the Bounty Hunter's Guild can serve a special role," she stuck out her tongue, showing a sly smile, "which is to find new uses for some seemingly useless abilities, so that non-combat witches won't feel discouraged about their powers being of little use."



Ashes was amused by her expression, "You always have so many reasons, layer upon layer, making it hard for one to refuse."



"Because I'm always right," Tilly pouted, "Let's change the subject. Maggie still hasn't returned to Sleeping Island, has something happened there?"



"Maybe she's been delayed," Ashes pondered for a moment, "Or perhaps..."



"What?"



"She doesn't want to come back," she shrugged, "Compared to the Fjords, the living conditions over there are much better. I've always said not to send witches there, what if Lotus and Honey also don't want to come back?"



"Then let's go," Tilly said.

"Oh, then I'll go get ready... What?" Ashes was taken aback for a moment before coming to her senses, "Me, we're going over?"

The Fifth Princess pursed her lips, "Didn't we agree to help him fight the demonic beasts and bring back the other witches along the way? Without Lotus, there will be no houses for the immigrants at Crescent Moon Bay next year."

"But there's still over a month left until winter, do we need to go so soon?"

"It'll take quite some time on the road, and if Border Town really encounters any trouble, it would be better for us to arrive earlier to help the witches of the Witch Union. Besides..." she winked, "I want to see with my own eyes what my annoying brother has turned into."
