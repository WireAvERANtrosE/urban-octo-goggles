## New Round of Procurement
As the lord of the Western Region, Roland naturally did not need to do the work himself; he only needed to draw a rough sketch on paper and explain it clearly to the recruited tailors.



Although he had never personally handled a brassiere, he had seen too many of them in various advertisements, television shows, and movies. There weren't many designs to choose from—he opted for the most common type with shoulder straps and a back clasp, with three sets of copper hooks that allowed for some adjustment in tightness.



Since this item needed to be worn close to the body to fulfill its function of supporting the chest, Roland also called the maidservants from the castle to have the tailors take their measurements. The tailor, who had many years of experience in cutting clothes, immediately understood the purpose of the brassiere after listening to His Highness' explanation. She classified the brassieres into several sizes based on actual measurements, with different sizes offering various adjustment ranges.



In fact, the prototype of the brassiere—the corset—had already appeared in this era. However, it was not designed for women's comfort but to tighten the waist as much as possible and to push up the chest, giving the figure an hourglass shape. Those gorgeous noble dresses were also designed with a slim waist in mind, and without the aid of a corset, it would be difficult for an average woman to fit into such narrowly waisted dresses. The excessive constriction around the waist was an extremely uncomfortable experience and could even affect blood circulation and cause fainting when severe.



In addition to supporting the chest, the brassiere also served to stabilize and reduce jiggling, making it more comfortable for women to wear in their daily lives.



In just two days, the experienced tailor had cut twenty brassieres, using silk satin and fine cotton provided by Roland. They were both beautiful and breathable, and the craftsmanship was exceptionally fine.



However, before Roland had the chance to give this gift to the witches, a caravan from the capital arrived at Border Town.



Compared to the punctual arrival last month, not only was the fleet late this time, but its scale was also much smaller. When the sailboats docked at the expanded wharf of the small town, there was even a feeling of sparseness.



"Your Highness, we meet again," Margaret said with a smile.



"Welcome, you've worked hard transporting the refugees previously," Roland looked towards the fleet by the river, "It seems there are many fewer sailboats this time?"



"Due to some... unexpected reasons," she wiped the sweat from her forehead, "If you don't mind, let's talk in the reception room. It's really too hot here."



"I feel the same," Hogg muttered, "I'm a genuine Greycastle man, this damned weather is almost the death of me. If it weren't for the first steam engine, I wouldn't want to leave my home."



Roland nodded and led the group back to the castle. As they entered the hall, a cool breeze immediately hit them, and Hogg let out a sigh of relief, "Thank the deities for letting us discover such a wonderful thing... If I hadn't seen the production process of the ice caltrop with my own eyes, I would hardly believe it comes out of sewage. Oh, and the ice water! Your Highness, may I—"



"Of course," Roland gestured for him to help himself, then sat back in the main seat and asked the female merchant, "So, what accident has caused this month's goods—mainly the saltpeter—to decrease sharply?"



According to the contract, she was supposed to provide Border Town with at least three ships of saltpeter every month, but this time, there was only one sailboat carrying saltpeter.



"Because of the King's City Alchemist Association, they've been buying saltpeter recently. The price isn't high, but with the support of Prime Minister Duke Ryan, it's not purely a trade. The merchants have no choice but to sell," Margaret spread her hands, "I guess Timothy might be behind this, considering the Prime Minister is practically breathing through the same nostril as him."



"Timothy?" Roland asked in confusion, "Didn't he go to the Southern Territory?"



"That's right," she nodded, "It seems Theo has already informed you. I heard that before he left the King's City, he took quite a few men and supplies with him. Most likely, he's going to trouble Grace again, and the Alchemist Association's aggressive purchase of saltpeter started shortly after he left."



Roland knew more about the matter, and it was indeed effective to arrange for Theo to work in the King's City. At first, he only received news of Timothy gathering the underground rats, and to prevent the enemy from suddenly invading, he even specifically asked Peter to strengthen the boundary work of the stronghold. However, the next secret letter from the personal guards allowed Roland to breathe a sigh of relief—Timothy went straight to the Southern Territory, and obviously, this recruitment was not aimed at him.



Regarding the use of these rats, Roland and the personal guards had basically the same view: they were not suitable for frontal combat at all, their discipline was even worse than that of civilians and serfs. Therefore, Timothy's way of using these people must be the same as last time: first, get them addicted to drugs, then force them to go forward and kill the enemy. This tactic of using cannon fodder to repeatedly deplete the opponent's strength was, for the new king who held two-thirds of Greycastle's land, a steady strategy.



However, why did the Alchemist Association suddenly want to purchase a large amount of saltpeter? Snow powder was originally one of their flagship products, but the wrong mixture made it only usable for sound-making barrels. Now, have they discovered the correct formula for gunpowder and are planning to manufacture it in bulk, or are they on the path of wanting to determine the best mixture ratio through a large number of trials?



Roland shook his head, casting aside the doubts that had surfaced in his mind. Speculating about these was meaningless. Completing the industrial production of the three acids and two alkalis as soon as possible and transitioning to more advanced chemical gunpowder was the right path.



"So we can't guarantee the supply of three ships of saltpeter for the next month either?"



"I... I don't know," Margaret seemed a bit troubled, but still spoke frankly, "The ship that came to the Western Territory was one I obtained from Silver City with much effort. Now it's the hottest time of the summer, and the demand for saltpeter is very high, so I'm not sure how much I can buy. If it were any other season, I could guarantee the supply for three ships."



"I understand," Roland drank a sip of ice water, "Then do your best next month. If not, there's no need to force it. I have new goods that I need to purchase from you."



"Oh?" Margaret seemed to breathe a sigh of relief, "What is it? Still ores?"



"It's washing stones for cleaning clothes," he replied, "They look like white, murky flakes or columns, and they feel slippery when soaked in water. These things are not uncommon in the inns of the King's City."



"Indeed... more ore," the female merchant said with a resigned smile, "Even though your territory has a large mine, the goods you buy are all minerals, which is really hard to understand. Well, there is plenty of this stuff and it's not expensive, so what do you plan to use it for?"

"Of course, it's for making laundry more convenient," Roland chuckled.



The washing stone was something he had dug out from the memories of the fourth prince. It is essentially a natural alkali, mainly composed of sodium bicarbonate, and has a strong decontamination effect. It is known as one of the three ancient cleaning artifacts along with wood ash and pancreas. Without an ion exchange membrane, the efficiency of collecting sodium hydroxide by electrolyzing salt water is very low, not to mention that salt is not as cheap as cabbage. Therefore, he planned to directly purchase natural alkali to produce caustic soda. With a sufficient amount of caustic soda, he could then mass-produce soap... as well as the byproduct of soap, glycerin.
