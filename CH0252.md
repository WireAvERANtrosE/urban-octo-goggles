## A New Round of Procurement
As the lord of the Western Region, Roland naturally didn't need to do the work himself. He simply drew a rough sketch on paper and explained it to the recruited tailors.

Although he had never personally touched a bra, he had seen too many of them in various advertisements, TV shows, and films. There were only a few styles to choose from—he opted for the most common type, with straps and a back closure featuring three sets of copper hooks, allowing for some adjustment in tightness.

Since this garment needed to be worn close to the body to meet the requirements of chest binding, Roland also called the maids from the castle to have their measurements taken by the tailors. Having worked in garment cutting for many years, the tailor was very experienced. After listening to His Highness the Prince's explanation, she immediately understood the purpose of the bra and, based on actual measurements, categorized the bras into several sizes, with different ranges of adjustment within each size.

In fact, the prototype of the bra—the corset—had already appeared in this era. However, it wasn't designed for women's comfort but to tighten the waist as much as possible and push up the bust, creating an hourglass figure. Those gorgeous noble gowns were also designed with a narrow waist in mind, and without the support of a corset, it would be difficult for ordinary women to wear such tightly waisted dresses. The excessive pressure on the waist was extremely uncomfortable and, in severe cases, could even affect blood circulation and lead to fainting.

Besides supporting the bust, bras also served to stabilize and reduce jiggling, making them more comfortable for daily wear.

In just two days, the old tailor had cut twenty bras, using the silk and fine cotton provided by Roland, which were both beautiful and breathable, with exceptionally fine workmanship.

However, before Roland could present this gift to the witches, a caravan from the capital arrived at Border Town.

Compared to the punctual arrival last month, the fleet was not only late this time but also much smaller in scale. When the sailboats docked at the newly expanded pier of the small town, they even seemed rather sparse.

"Your Highness, we meet again," Margaret said with a smile.



"Welcome, you must have worked hard transporting the refugees before," Roland looked towards the fleet by the river, "It seems there are fewer sailboats this time?"



"Some... unexpected reasons," she wiped the sweat from her forehead, "If you don't mind, let's talk in the parlor. It's really too hot here."



"I feel the same," Hogg muttered, "I'm a true Greycastle man, this damn weather is nearly the death of me. If it weren't for the first steam engine, I wouldn't want to leave my house at all."



Roland nodded and led the group back to the castle. As they entered the hall, a cool breeze instantly hit them, and Hogg let out a sigh of relief, "Thank the gods for letting us discover such a wonderful thing... Had I not seen the production process of the Ice Calm with my own eyes, I would hardly believe it comes from sewage. Oh, and the ice water! Your Highness, may I—"



"Of course," Roland gestured for him to help himself, then sat back in the main seat and asked the female merchant, "So, what accident has led to this month's sharp decrease in goods—mainly the saltpeter?"



According to the contract, she was supposed to supply Border Town with at least three ships of saltpeter every month, but this time, there was only one sailboat carrying saltpeter.



"Because of the King's City Alchemists Association, they have been buying up saltpeter lately. The price is not high, but with the support of the Prime Minister, Duke Wimbledon, it's not purely a trade—the merchants could hardly refuse to sell." Margaret spread her hands, "I guess this might be Timothy's doing, after all, the Prime Minister and he are practically breathing through the same nostril."



"Timothy?" Roland asked in confusion, "Didn't he go to the Southern Territory?"



"Indeed he did," she nodded, "It seems Tassa has already told you the news. It's said that before he left the King's City, he took quite a number of men and supplies with him, most likely to trouble Grace again, and the Alchemists Association's mass purchase of saltpeter started shortly after his departure."



Roland knew more about this matter. It was indeed effective to arrange Tassa to work in the King's City. Initially, he only received news of Timothy summoning the underground rats and, to prevent a sudden invasion, he specifically requested Barov to strengthen the border work of the fortress. However, the next secret letter from the personal guard allowed Roland to breathe a sigh of relief—Timothy went straight to the southern border, clearly, this recruitment was not aimed at him.



Regarding the use of these rats, Roland and the personal guard had basically the same view: they were not suitable for frontal combat, and their discipline was even worse than that of civilians and serfs. So, the way Timothy used these people must be the same as before, first addicting them with drugs, then forcing them to kill the enemy. This tactic of repeatedly depleting the enemy's strength with cannon fodder was a safe strategy for the new king who controlled two-thirds of Greycastle's territory.



However, why did the Alchemist Association suddenly want to purchase a large amount of saltpeter? Snow powder was originally one of their flagship products, but the wrong ratio meant it could only be used for sounding barrels. Are they now discovering the correct formula for gunpowder, intending to manufacture it in bulk, or are they on the path of wanting to conduct a large number of experiments to determine the optimal mix ratio?



Roland shook his head, casting aside the doubts that emerged in his mind. Speculating was meaningless. It was more important to complete the industrialization of the three acids and two alkalis as soon as possible and move on to more advanced chemical propellants.



"So we can't guarantee the supply of three ships' worth of saltpeter next month either?"



"I... I don't know," Margaret seemed to be in some difficulty, but she still spoke frankly, "This ship coming to the Western Territory took a lot of effort to purchase from Silver City. It's the hottest time of summer now, and the demand for saltpeter is very high, so I'm not sure how much I can buy. If it were any other season, I could guarantee the supply for three ships."



"I understand," Roland took a sip of iced water, "Then try your best next month. If not, there's no need to force it. I have new goods that I need to purchase from you."



"Oh?" Margaret seemed relieved, "What is it? Is it ore again?"



"It's a washing stone used for cleaning clothes," he replied, "It looks like white, cloudy chips or pillars, and when soaked in water, it feels slippery. This stuff is not uncommon in the inns of the King's City."



"Indeed... it's ore again," the female merchant said with a resigned smile, "Even though there's a big mine in your territory, the goods you buy are all minerals. It's really hard to understand. Well, there is indeed a lot of this stuff and it's not expensive. What do you plan to do with it?"

"I plan to use it to make washing clothes more convenient," Roland said with a laugh.

The washing stone was something he dug out from the memories of the Fourth Prince. It is essentially a natural alkali, mainly composed of sodium bicarbonate, and has a strong decontamination effect. Along with wood ash and saponin, it is known as one of the three great ancient cleaning agents. Without an ion exchange membrane, the efficiency of collecting sodium hydroxide by electrolyzing saltwater is extremely low, not to mention that salt is not as cheap as cabbage. So, he planned to directly purchase natural alkali to produce caustic soda. With an ample supply of caustic soda, he could mass-produce soap... and its byproduct, glycerin.
