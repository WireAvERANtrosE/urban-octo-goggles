## Starting today, I will become a prince.
Cheng Yan felt someone calling him.

"Your Highness, wake up..."

He turned his head away, but the voice did not disappear; instead, it grew louder. He felt someone reach out a hand and gently tug on his sleeve.

"Your Highness, Prince Your Highness!"

Cheng Yan suddenly opened his eyes, the familiar screen was gone, the desk was gone, the walls plastered with sticky notes were also gone. In their place was a bizarre scene—a low-rise brick house, a bustling circular square, and a gallows set up in the center of the square. He was sitting on a platform opposite the square, not on a soft swivel chair but on a cold, hard iron chair. A circle of people sat around him, staring intently at him, among them a few women dressed like medieval ladies from the West were covering their mouths and snickering.

What kind of place is this? Shouldn't I be rushing to finish the blueprint? Cheng Yan's mind was blank, working overtime for three consecutive days had pushed him to his limit, both mentally and physically. He only remembered that he couldn't hold on any longer, his heartbeat became erratic, fast and slow, and he wanted to lay his head down on the desk to rest for a moment...

"Your Highness, please announce the verdict."

The speaker was the same person who had secretly tugged at his sleeve, an old man who looked to be in his sixties, wearing a white robe, and at first glance, he looked a bit like Gandalf from The Lord of the Rings.

Am I dreaming? Cheng Yan licked his dry lips, verdict, what verdict?



However, he quickly found out what was going on. The people in the square were all looking towards the gallows, waving their fists and shouting. Occasionally, one or two stones were thrown at the gallows.



Cheng Yan had only seen such an ancient instrument of punishment in movies before—two vertical posts about four meters high, with a wooden beam across the top, and a rusty iron ring set into the center of the beam. A yellowed, coarse hemp rope passed through the iron ring, with one end fixed under the gallows and the other looped around the prisoner's neck.



In this bizarre dream, he discovered that his vision had become amazingly sharp. Usually, he couldn't see the words on a screen without his glasses, but now he could make out every detail of the execution platform fifty meters away with absolute clarity.



The prisoner wore a hood, their hands tied behind their back, and dressed in a coarse, gray tunic as dirty as a rag. They were thin, their exposed ankles looked as if they could be snapped by hand. A slight bulge in the chest indicated that the prisoner was a woman. She shivered in the wind but still tried to stand straight.



So, what crime had this person committed to incite such righteous indignation from the crowd, eagerly waiting for her to be hanged?



Just as this thought occurred to him, Cheng Yan's memory seemed to suddenly connect, and the answer almost immediately appeared before him.



She was a "witch."



Seduced by the devil and fallen, the embodiment of the unclean.



"Your Highness?" Gandalf prompted cautiously.



He glanced at the other person, hmm, so his name wasn't Gandalf, Barov was his real name, the Assistant Minister of Finance, dispatched to deal with the political affairs for himself.

And he himself, was the fourth prince of the Kingdom of Greycastle, Roland, here to shepherd a territory. The residents of Border Town had caught a witch and immediately brought her to the police station—no, that's wrong, to the court. The decree to execute a witch was usually issued by the local lord or bishop, and since he was the ruling authority here, issuing the decree had become part of his duties.

His memory presented the answers to the questions he most needed to resolve one by one, no need for filtering, no need to read, as if he had experienced it all himself. Cheng Yan was momentarily confused; no dream could be so detailed, so then, this wasn't a dream? Had he traveled to the dark ages of medieval Europe and become Roland? From an overnight drafting dog to the noble fourth prince?

Despite the kingdom's territory looking so barren and backward, he had never come across the name Kingdom of Greycastle in history books.

So, what should he do next?

The unscientific matter of traveling through time could be researched later, but the farce in front of him had to stop—blaming disasters and misfortunes on some poor souls was the norm for uncivilized civilizations, but to satisfy the dark psychology of the spectators by hanging someone for it, Cheng Yan found this folly truly unacceptable.

He grabbed the decree that Barov was holding and threw it to the ground, stretching himself, “Tired, I’ll judge another day, everyone disperse for today!”

Cheng Yan did this not as a reckless act, but after carefully recalling the prince's style of behavior from his memories, bringing out that willful and extravagant flair. Indeed, the fourth prince was such a scumbag by nature, with a terrible personality, doing whatever came to mind. After all, what good manners could one expect from a prince in his early twenties, unrestrained by anyone?

The nobles sitting on the high platform looked unsurprised, but a tall man in armor stood up, “Your Highness, this is no joking matter! Once a witch's identity is confirmed she should be executed immediately, otherwise what if other witches come and rescue her? The Church will not turn a blind eye to this.”



Carter Lannis, this man with an upright face, was actually his Chief Knight. Cheng Yan frowned and said, "What, are you afraid?" The undisguised mockery in his words was not entirely an act. A strong man whose arm was thicker than someone else's body was actually worried about the other party breaking the jail. Did he really take the witch as the spokesperson of the devil? "Wouldn't it be better to catch them all in one go?"



Seeing him fall silent, Cheng Yan waved his hand, signaling the guard to lead him away. Carter hesitated for a moment but still followed the team, walking beside the Fourth Prince. The other nobles stood up and bowed, but Cheng Yan could see the undisguised contempt in their eyes from the corner of his eye.



Returning to the temporary palace—also located in the castle south of Border Town—he had the guards stop the anxious-looking assistant minister at the door of the hall before he could finally breathe a sigh of relief.



As someone who spent ninety percent of his time dealing with computers, being able to perform in front of people like this was an overachievement. Cheng Yan found his bedroom according to his memory and sat on the bed to rest for a while before he managed to calm his racing heart. The most pressing matter was to figure out the situation. As a prince, why not stay in the king's city, and what was he doing in this desolate place?



It was fine not to think about it, but as soon as the thought came up, he was stunned by the answer.



Roland Wimbledon was here to compete for the throne.



The whole thing started with the bizarre will of King Wimbledon III of Greycastle: to inherit the kingdom, it was not the eldest son who had the highest right of succession, but the one most capable of governing the country. He sent his five adult children to various territories under his rule, and after five years, the one who governs the best would be designated as the crown prince.



The capable one should take the position, and with gender equality, it sounded like a very advanced idea. The problem was that the actual implementation was completely different. Who could guarantee that the starting conditions for all five were the same? This was not like playing a real-time strategy game. As far as he knew, the territory granted to the Second Prince was much better than Border Town—well, it seemed that among the five, there was no worse place than Border Town, which was simply starting at a major disadvantage.



Furthermore, how would one evaluate the level of governance? Population? Military? Economy? King Wimbledon III had not mentioned any criteria, nor had he placed any restrictions on the competition. What if someone played the assassination game behind the scenes? How would that be counted? Would the queen mother watch her sons kill each other? Wait a minute... he thought back carefully, alright, another piece of bad news, the queen mother had passed away five years ago.



Cheng Yan sighed. It was clear that this was a savage and dark feudal era, as evident from the indiscriminate hunting of witches. Becoming a prince was already a high starting point. Moreover, even without gaining the throne, he was still of the blood of the King of Greycastle. As long as he could survive, being granted a title and land would make him a lord in his own right.



And what about becoming a king? Without the internet, without the nourishment of modern civilization, would he have to be like these natives, burning witches for fun, living in a city where excrement was dumped at will, and ultimately dying from the ravages of the Black Death?



Cheng Yan suppressed the chaotic thoughts in his heart and walked to the full-length mirror in the bedroom. The man in the mirror had light grey curly hair, which was the most distinctive feature of the Greycastle royal family. His features were still decent, but his face was somewhat slack, lacking any sense of vigor. His complexion was pale and he lacked exercise. As for indulgence in wine and women, he recalled that it was not too bad. He had a few lovers in the king's city, all of whom were voluntary, and he had never forced anyone.



As for the reason for his transmigration, Cheng Yan had a rough guess—it must have been caused by the inhumane rush from the client and the sudden death due to overwork arranged by his boss. Cases like this invariably involved coders, mechanical hounds, and engineering lions.



No matter how he thought about it, this was at least equivalent to an extra life, and he really shouldn't complain too much. In the days to come, he might slowly change this way of life, but for now, the primary task was to play the part of the fourth prince well, not to let anyone discover the slip-up and be tied to the stake as if possessed by the devil.



"Since this is the case, I must first survive," he took a deep breath and whispered to the mirror, "From now on, I am Roland."
