## Starting today, become a prince.
Cheng Yan felt someone calling him.

"Your Highness, wake up..."

He turned his head away, but the voice did not disappear; instead, it grew louder. He felt someone reach out and gently tug at his sleeve.

"Your Highness, Your Royal Highness!"

Cheng Yan abruptly opened his eyes. The familiar screen was gone, the office desk was gone, the wall plastered with sticky notes was gone, replaced by a bizarre scene—a low brick and stone house, a bustling circular plaza, and in the center of the plaza, a door-shaped gallows erected. He was sitting on a platform opposite the plaza, not on a soft swivel chair, but on a cold, hard iron chair. Around him sat a circle of people, staring intently at him, among which a few women dressed like medieval Western ladies were covering their mouths and snickering.

What is this place? Shouldn't I be rushing to finish the drawings? Cheng Yan's mind was blank, three consecutive days of overtime had pushed him to his limits, and he only remembered that in the end he couldn't hold on any longer, his heartbeat became erratic, and he wanted to rest on his office desk for a moment...

"Your Highness, please announce the verdict," said the person who had been secretly tugging at his sleeve. He looked old, about fifty or sixty, wearing a white robe, and at a glance, looked a bit like Gandalf from The Lord of the Rings.

Am I dreaming? Cheng Yan licked his dry lips, verdict, what verdict?

But he soon found out. The people in the plaza were all looking towards the direction of the gallows, waving their fists and shouting, with the occasional stone thrown at the gallows.

Cheng Yan had only seen such an ancient instrument of punishment in movies—two columns about four meters high, with a wooden beam laid on top of the columns, and a rusty iron ring embedded in the middle of the beam. A yellowish thick hemp rope threaded through the iron ring, one end fixed under the gallows, the other looped around the neck of the criminal.

In this strange dream, he found that his vision had become amazingly clear. Normally, he couldn't see the words on the screen without his glasses, but now every detail on the gallows fifty meters away was crystal clear.

The criminal wore a hood, hands tied behind her back, and her rough gray tunic was as dirty as a rag. She was thin, and her exposed ankles looked as if they could be snapped by hand. There was a slight bulge in her chest, indicating that she was a woman. She shivered in the wind but still tried to stand upright.

Alright, what crime did this person commit that so many people were indignantly waiting for her to be hanged?

Just as the thought crossed his mind, Cheng Yan's memory seemed to be suddenly connected, and the answer almost immediately appeared before his eyes.

She was a 'witch'.



Seduced by the devil and fallen from grace, an incarnation of the unclean.

"Your Highness?" Barov cautiously urged.

He glanced at the man, hmm, so his name wasn't Gandalf, it was Barov, the assistant to the Minister of Finance, dispatched to handle administrative affairs for him.

And he himself was the fourth prince of the Kingdom of Greycastle, Roland, here to shepherd this land. The residents of Border Town had captured a witch and immediately sent her to the station—no, to the tribunal. The order to execute a witch was usually issued by the local lord or bishop, and since he was governing here, issuing the order had become part of his duties.

His memory presented him with the answers to the questions he most needed, without the need for selection or reading, as if he had experienced it all himself. Cheng Yan was confused for a moment; no dream could be this detailed, so, was this not a dream? Had he traveled to the dark ages of medieval Europe and become Roland? From a draftsman rushing to meet deadlines overnight to the dignified fourth prince?

Despite how barren and backward this part of the kingdom seemed, he had never come across the name Greycastle Kingdom in any history books.

So, what should he do next?

Traversing time and space was something that could be studied later, but the farce before him had to be stopped—blaming disasters and misfortunes on some unfortunate souls was the norm for uncivilized civilizations, but to hang someone to satisfy the dark psychology of the onlooking crowd was a folly Cheng Yan simply couldn't accept.

He grabbed the execution order Barov was holding and threw it to the ground, stretching lazily, "I'm tired, we'll judge another day. Disperse for today!"

Cheng Yan's actions were not reckless; instead, he carefully reflected on the prince's style in his memories, bringing back that capricious and indulgent attitude. Indeed, the fourth prince was just that troublesome, with a terrible personality, doing whatever came to mind. Speaking of which, one couldn't expect a prince in his early twenties, accountable to no one, to have much in the way of manners.

The nobles sitting on the high platform looked unsurprised, but a tall man in armor stepped forward, "Your Highness, this is no joke! Once a witch's identity is confirmed, she should be executed immediately; what if other witches come to rescue her? The Church will not ignore this."

Carter Lannis, this upright-looking man, was his own chief knight. Cheng Yan frowned, "What, are you scared?" His words, tinged with undisguised sarcasm, were not entirely an act. A burly man whose arm was thicker than someone else's body was worried about a jailbreak by witches, really taking witches as spokespersons for the devil? "Wouldn't it be better to catch them all in one go?"

Seeing that Carter no longer spoke, Cheng Yan waved his hand, signaling the guards to escort him away. Carter hesitated but followed the procession, walking beside the fourth prince. The other nobles stood up and bowed, but Cheng Yan could see the undisguised contempt in their eyes.

Back in the palace—located in the castle south of Border Town—he commanded the guards to keep the anxious-looking assistant minister outside the main hall, and only then did he breathe a sigh of relief.

As someone who spent ninety percent of his time dealing with computers, being able to perform like that in front of everyone was beyond his usual capacity. Cheng Yan found his bedroom according to his memory and sat on the bed to rest for a while, managing to calm his racing heart. The most pressing matter was to understand the situation; as a prince, why leave the royal city to come to this desolate place?

He was better off not thinking about it, for as soon as the thought arose, he was stunned by the answer.



Roland Wimbledon was actually here to compete for the throne.



The whole origin came from the whimsical will of the King of Greycastle, Wimbledon III: To inherit this kingdom, it was not the eldest prince who had the highest right of succession, but the one who was most capable of governing the country. He dispatched his five adult children to various territories under his rule, and after five years, he would decide who to appoint as the heir based on their governance.



The able rule, coupled with gender equality, sounded like a very progressive concept. The problem was that it was completely different in practice. Who could guarantee that all five would start on an equal footing? This wasn't like playing a real-time strategy game. As he knew, the second prince's territory was much better than Border Town—well, on second thought, there didn't seem to be a worse place than Border Town among the five, which was an outright disadvantage from the start.



Moreover, how to evaluate the level of governance? Population? Military? Economy? Wimbledon III didn't set any standards, nor did he put any restrictions on the competition. What if someone resorted to assassination in secret? Would the queen just watch her sons kill each other? Wait a minute... He thought carefully, and there was another piece of bad news—the queen had passed away five years ago.



Cheng Yan sighed. It was obviously a barbaric and dark feudal era, evident from the indiscriminate witch hunts. Becoming a prince was already a high starting point. Even without the throne, he was still of royal blood; as long as he survived, being ennobled and granted land would make him a lord.



And what about becoming king? Without the internet, without the nourishment of modern civilization, he would have to live like these natives, burning witches for entertainment, living in cities where excrement was dumped at will, and eventually dying from the ravages of the Black Death?



Cheng Yan suppressed the chaotic thoughts in his mind, walked to the full-length mirror in his bedroom, and the man in the mirror had light grey curly hair, the most distinctive feature of the Greycastle royal family. His features were still decent, just a bit lackluster, lacking in presence. His complexion was slightly pale, indicative of a lack of exercise. As for indulgence in wine and women, he recalled that it was not too bad; he had several lovers in the capital, all voluntary, and he had never forced anyone.



As for the reason for his transmigration, Cheng Yan had guessed the cause—it was probably due to the inhuman pressure from the client for progress, and the sudden death caused by the boss arranging overnight overtime. Cases like this usually involved programmers, mechanical dogs, and engineering lions.



Anyway, no matter how he thought about it, this was at least equivalent to an extra life; he really shouldn't complain too much. He might be able to slowly change this lifestyle in the future, but the current priority was to play the role of the fourth prince well, not to let anyone discover the truth, lest he be treated as possessed by the devil and tied to the stake.



"In that case, let's survive first," he took a deep breath, whispered to his reflection in the mirror, "From now on, I am Roland."
