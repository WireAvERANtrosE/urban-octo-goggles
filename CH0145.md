## Tracing Shadows (Part 1)
Tassa entered a tavern, where the stuffy and humid air mingled with the smell of alcohol assaulted his nostrils.

Under the dim lights, men stripped to their waists, revealing sweaty backs, sat around the central table, pouring cups of inferior beer into their mouths and laughing loudly with their companions. Scantily clad maids weaved between the tables, topping off the patrons' glasses.

He scanned the room and quickly found his target—a short figure sitting inconspicuously in a corner, with a withered wild rose on his table.

Tassa approached the bar and ordered a beer first. Savoring the bitter taste, he surveyed his surroundings to see if anyone was secretly tailing the short man. The result was to his satisfaction; although occasionally someone glanced at the corner, most seemed unintentional. Only a person sitting at the big central table seemed to be observing the corner's activities under the cover of his drinking glass.

One to make contact, one for backup—typical behavior of Black Street rats, which aligned with Tassa's understanding.

"Another one," he called out to the barmaid, "iced."

"Sir, iced beer is double the price," the barmaid reminded him.

Tassa tossed a Silver royal, "The colder, the better."

Carrying a mug that emitted tendrils of mist, he walked over and sat opposite the short man, pouring the beer over the wild rose at the edge of the table. The icy liquid flowed down the shriveled petals. The man looked up, annoyance written on his face, "What's the madness, pouring good beer on the table instead of drinking it?"



"Respect to the Rose," Tassa smiled and sat down opposite him, "I've been looking for you guys for a long time."

"That just proves you didn't look in the right direction," he replied grumpily, "Since you're a customer... out with it, what do you want? Asking for clues, stealing something, ransom for lost items, or fencing goods?"

"None of those, I hope you can help me spread a rumor."

"That's not within the Rose's line of business." He shook his head.

"No, no, no, as long as Gold royals can pay, you'll be interested," Tassa wagged his finger, "I'm not an outsider, lad. Sometimes, to bait the prey, you need to create some lures, and rumors are the best bait. No evidence, no way to capture. It's much safer than stealing."

"That does sound reasonable," the other party straightened up, revealing a slight smile, "Have you commissioned the Rose before?"

"I've commissioned your peers, small-time operators. Their name isn't as elegant as yours, nor can they do much."

"If their business scope is too narrow, it's hard to find suitable deals. In Silver City, the competition is really fierce." He flicked a wild rose and then tucked it into his pocket, "Tell me, what kind of rumor do you need to spread?"

"News about witches," Tassa smiled, "An organization called the Mutual Aid Society has found the Holy Mountain in the Western Region, and they've escaped the agony of demonic possession, gaining eternal peace."



"Brother, this news is really..." the short man smacked his lips, "quite old-fashioned. Although I seldom teach customers how to deceive others, your rumor should at least be made a bit more believable. Let me guess, if you're not here to abduct witches, then you're looking to trap and kill the Church. For the latter, you'll only end up with a bunch of the Judgement Army sending you to the gallows, so I think it must be the former..." He revealed a sleazy smile, "Too bad, as far as I know, those who want to capture witches for money mostly end up dead. Even though they all carry the Divine Stone of Judgement, those women are not fools."



"Why is it not believable?" Tassa asked curiously.



"An organization formed by witches is like the moon in the night sky. If it were real, the Church would swarm it. If I were a witch, I certainly wouldn't go near such a place. If it's fake, then I have even less reason to go. As for getting rid of a devil's possession, brother, are you serious? Witches are the incarnations of devils. Such a blatant lie would probably be scoffed at by the witches themselves."



"Then let's spread the word just like that," Tassa said indifferently.



"The customer is always right," the short man shrugged, "Anyway, I've warned you. The fee is twenty Gold Royals."



"Pay the whole amount at once?"



"That's right, the Rose doesn't take deposits nor final payments," he spread his hands, "The deal is all voluntary."



Tassa sighed, took out a pouch from his pocket, poured nineteen Gold Royals onto the table, and then grabbed a handful of Silver Royals the size of fingernails from his waist pouch. He counted out one hundred and pushed them towards the short man. The latter only verified the authenticity of the Gold Royals before sweeping them all into a cloth bag.



With the money in hand, the short man's expression relaxed a lot, "The Rose rarely fails to deliver on its promises. Didn't I tell you before? The competition in Silver City is fierce. If we deceive customers, our reputation will drop. If you're not in a hurry to rush back to the Western Territory to wait for the fish to bite, you can stay here a few more days. It won't be long before you hear this news spreading everywhere."



"Will it also reach the ears of the witches?" 

"Of course, but whether they are willing to go is another matter. Anyway, I wish you success. Catching one could cover your costs if sold to the Church, and you'll earn even more if sold to the nobility. Of course, if you can't find a way to sell her and are afraid of being discovered by the Church, you can come to us later. We only charge a 10% referral fee." 

The short man snapped his fingers and left with the cloth bag. After a while, the burly man who was in charge of the lookout also got up and left. Tassa waited for about a quarter of an hour before finishing the remaining wine in his glass in one gulp, belched, and walked out of the tavern. 

With this, the task assigned by Prince Roland was completed, he thought. He had traveled through Falling Dragon Ridge, Redwater City, and Silver City, finding the local underworld rats and spreading the word—every city had a group lurking in the dark corners, even under the tacit approval of the lord. They would form an orderly and covert organization, and not even in the capital of Greycastle was an exception. What they could do was far more than what was openly discussed, and the extent to which they would go largely depended on how much Gold royals the customer was willing to spend. 

The only difficulty was making contact with these rats, and he had to admit, being an outsider, it was quite difficult to gain their trust. Just the secret phrase alone cost him no less than five Gold royals. Tassa lamented in his heart that if it were not for similar experiences in the capital, he would probably still be stuck in Falling Dragon Ridge. 

Walking on the way back to the inn, he sensed something was off. 

He was being followed. 

Despite the subtlety of the pursuer, Tassa, as a professional guard, noticed their presence. He touched the dagger at his waist and turned into a narrow alley on the side. 

Is it the Rose? He had deliberately turned his purse inside out when paying, only to shake out nineteen Gold royals, to avoid arousing any covetousness. Generally speaking, a few hundred Silver royals would not tempt them to rob a customer.



He leaned against the wall, counting the footsteps that grew closer and closer. As the other person was about to pass by the alleyway, he suddenly rushed out, pressing the dagger instantly against the other's neck.

"Don't move!" Tassa hissed.

Unexpectedly, the other turned into a puff of smoke and vanished without a trace.

A witch! He realized, just as he was about to shout out, he received a heavy blow to the back of his neck. He immediately felt the world spin around him as he helplessly collapsed to the ground.
