## Tracing Shadows (Part 1)
Theo walked into a tavern, where the stifling and humid air mixed with the scent of alcohol hit his nose. Under the dim light, men had taken off their shirts, revealing their backs drenched in sweat. They sat around the central table, pouring cup after cup of cheap beer into their mouths, laughing and talking loudly with their companions. Scantily clad maids weaved through the tables, topping off the patrons' cups.



He took a quick look around and soon found his target—a small figure sitting in an inconspicuous corner, with a withered wild rose on the table before him.



Theo approached the bar and first ordered a beer. Savoring the bitter taste, he surveyed his surroundings to see if anyone was secretly watching the small figure. He was quite satisfied with the result. Although people occasionally glanced towards the corner, it was mostly unintentional. Only one person sitting by the large central table was covertly observing the corner under the guise of drinking from his cup.



One person to make contact, another to provide cover—typical behavior for the Black Street rats, which was in line with Theo's understanding.



"Another one," he called out to the barmaid, "iced."



"Sir, the price of iced beer is double," the barmaid reminded him.



Theo tossed a Silver royal. "The colder, the better."



Holding the mug that emitted a mist of cold air, he walked over to the small figure and poured the beer on the wild rose at the edge of the table. As the ice-cold liquid trickled down the shriveled petals, the other party lifted his head, clearly annoyed, "Why waste good beer on the table? Are you out of your mind?"



"Respect to the Rose," Theo smiled and sat down opposite her, "I've been looking for you for a long time."

"That just proves you weren't looking in the right direction," he replied gruffly, "Since you're a customer... tell me, what do you want? Asking for clues, stealing, ransoming lost items, or fencing stolen goods?"

"None of the above. I hope you can help me spread a rumor."

"That's not within the Rose's line of work," he shook his head.

"No, no, no, as long as Gold royals can pay, you'd be interested," Theo wagged his finger, "I'm no outsider, young man. Sometimes, to bait the prey, one must craft some lure, and rumors are the best bait; no evidence, no arrest. It's much safer than stealing."

"That does sound quite reasonable," the other party sat up straight, revealing a hint of a smile, "Have you commissioned the Rose before?"

"I've commissioned your counterparts, in smaller places. Their names weren't as elegant as yours, nor could they do much."

"If the scope of business is too small, it's hard to find the right deals. Silver City, ah, the competition is indeed fierce." He took out a wild rose and flicked it, then put it in his own pocket, "Tell me, what kind of rumor do you need to spread?"

"News about witches," Theo smiled, "An organization known as the Mutual Aid Society has found the Holy Mountain in the Western Territory, and they have rid themselves of the demonic plague and have obtained eternal peace."



"Brother, this news is really..." the short man smacked his lips, "it's really outdated. Although I seldom incite customers on how to deceive others, at least you should make your rumors somewhat believable. Let me guess, if you're not trying to abduct witches, then you must be plotting against the Church. With the latter, you'll just end up waiting for a bunch of Judgement Army to send you to the gallows, so I guess it must be the former..." He revealed a sleazy smile, "Pity, as far as I know, most of those who tried to capture witches for money are dead. Even though they all carried God's Stones of Retribution, those women are no fools."



"Why isn't it believable?" Theo asked curiously.



"An organization formed by witches is like the moon in the night sky. If it were real, the Church would swarm over, and if I were a witch, I naturally wouldn't flock to such a place. If it's fake, then I have even less reason to bother. As for getting rid of demonic bites, brother, are you serious? Witches are the embodiment of devils; such an outrageous lie would probably be scoffed at by the witches themselves."



"Then let's spread the word just like that," Theo said nonchalantly.



"The customer is always right," the short man shrugged, "Anyway, I've warned you. The fee is twenty Gold Royals."



"Pay it all at once?"



"That's right, the Rose doesn't take deposits nor final payments," he spread his hands, "The deal is entirely voluntary."



Theo sighed, took out a pouch from his pocket, poured nineteen Gold Royals on the table, then grabbed a handful of Silver Royals the size of fingernails from his belt, counted out one hundred, and pushed them towards the short man. The latter only checked the authenticity of the Gold Royals briefly before sweeping them all into a cloth bag.



With the money in hand, the short man's expression relaxed considerably, "The Rose seldom fails to deliver on a promise. Haven't I told you before? The competition in Silver City is really fierce; if we were to cheat our customers, our reputation would suffer too. If you're not in a hurry to return to the Western Territory to await your catch, you could stay here a few more days. It won't take long before you'll hear this news spreading everywhere."



"Will this also reach the ears of the witches?"

"Of course, but whether they are willing to go is another matter. Anyway, I wish you success. Catching one and selling her to the Church will let you break even, and selling to a noble will earn you even more. Of course, if you can't find a way to sell her and are afraid of being discovered by the Church, you can come to us. We only charge a ten percent referral fee."

The short man snapped his fingers and left with the cloth bag. After a while, the burly man responsible for watching over also got up and left. Theo waited for about a quarter of an hour before finishing the remaining wine in his cup in one gulp, belched, and walked out of the tavern.



With this, the task entrusted by Prince Roland was completed, he thought. He had traveled through Dragon Cliffs City, Redwater City, and Silverstream City, finding the local underworld rats and spreading the message—every city had groups lurking in dark corners, and even with the tacit approval of the lord, they would form an orderly and covert organization, not excluding the capital of Greycastle itself. The things they could do were far more than what was openly discussed, and how far they would go mainly depended on the number of Gold royals the customer offered.



The only difficulty in this matter was making contact with the rats. It must be said, as a foreigner, gaining their trust was quite challenging, and it took him no less than five Gold royals just for the code phrase to make contact. Theo lamented in his heart that if it weren't for similar experiences in the capital, he would probably still be stuck in Dragon Cliffs City.



Walking back to the inn, he sensed something amiss in the atmosphere.



He was being followed.



Despite the other party's efforts to be covert, Theo, as a professional guard, still noticed their presence. He drew the dagger from his waist and turned into a small alley on the side.



Could it be the Rose? He had deliberately turned his coin purse inside out when paying, only to pour out nineteen Gold royals, just to avoid arousing others' covetousness. Generally speaking, a few hundred Silver royals would not tempt them to rob a customer.



Leaning against the wall, he counted the footsteps that grew increasingly closer. As the other party was about to pass by the alleyway, he burst out, the dagger instantly pressed against the other's neck.

"Don't move!" Theo barked in a low voice.

Unexpectedly, the opponent suddenly turned into a mist and disappeared.

A witch! He realized, just as he was about to shout out, he was struck hard at the back of his neck. He immediately felt the world spinning and collapsed to the ground, powerless.
