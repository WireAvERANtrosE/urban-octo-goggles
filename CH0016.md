The fire in the fireplace was burning vigorously, dispelling the chill seeping in from the cracks in the doors and windows. A deer head with large antlers hung above the fireplace, and in the glow of the flames, the antlers cast shadows on the wall behind like huge claws and fangs.



Opposite was a dark red long wooden table, covered with scrolls of parchment and books, most of them waiting for signatures as administrative orders. Usually, Roland would handle official duties here—ever since he transformed the rooms on the third floor of the castle into an office, he had grown to like this place.



Through the floor-to-ceiling windows behind him, he could see the town stretching out in front of his view, with the endless mountains at the end. Those were the Impassable Mountain Range, which almost spanned the continent, separating the Kingdom of Greycastle from the barbaric lands to the east and west. The Northern Slope Mine was just a branch of the Impassable Mountain Range.



Below, he could see the garden enclosed by wooden fences. The wooden shed used for Anna's training had been dismantled, and the brick pool was turned into a long table, convenient for setting utensils during afternoon tea. If the weather was nice, he would also go downstairs to enjoy the sun or lie in a specially customized rocking chair for a nap.



Although the castle was not large, it was still considered a medium-sized villa with its own independent garden. In his previous life, owning a real stone castle was almost a fairy tale; even just visiting one would require buying a ticket. But now, he not only owned this castle but also controlled a town.



"Your Highness, the recent recruitment of craftsmen and laborers has been quite costly, and this money is coming out of your pocket. I'm afraid it won't last until next spring," Barov reported to Roland, holding a stack of parchment papers about the recent financial situation.



The original income and expenses of Border Town were very simple, with one line being the trade of ores and gems. This line was monopolized by Longsong Stronghold, which exchanged the output of the Northern Slope Mine for wheat or bread, without any taxation, and the exchange of resources was overseen by people dispatched from the stronghold. In layman's terms, the Northern Slope Mine was a joint-stock project of the nobles of Longsong Stronghold. The nobles stationed in Border Town could be regarded as supervisors sent by the shareholders, and their fiefs were mostly to the east of the stronghold, staying here only temporarily, and different people came every year.



In fact, the history of Border Town was less than thirty years, which was nothing compared to the nearly two hundred years of Longsong Stronghold, making it a mere infant. Originally, the Duke of Lion only intended to establish an outpost here for early warning against demonic beast attacks. However, the pioneers unexpectedly discovered rich mineral resources in the Northern Slope Mountain Range, so they simply set up a town here and named it Border Town. In a sense, it was the Northern Slope Mine that created the town.



To prevent theft and underreporting, the Duke did not adopt the suggestion of each noble sending their own people to mine. Instead, he uniformly employed local residents, nearby vagrants, and even criminals as miners, with the ore output distributed according to the proportion of resources invested by each family. The stronghold only needed to provide the hired workers with a year's worth of food and a small commission, which were fixed amounts and did not vary with the output of the mine. Of the more than two thousand residents of Border Town, the majority served the mining area.



Another line of development involved the other industries in the town—such as the blacksmith shop, tavern, textile workshop, and so on. Border Town's meager tax revenue mainly came from here, and it was difficult to have much surplus throughout the year. The previous lord didn't take this barren land seriously, and ever since Roland was sent here by the King of Greycastle, he simply stayed in the stronghold and didn't come over.



Therefore, if Roland wanted to hire people to repair the town walls, he could only pay out of his own pocket. If he were the previous Fourth Prince, he would definitely not be willing to do so, but for Roland, as long as he could secure his foothold in Border Town, he deemed spending all of his wealth worthwhile. After all, future ore trade wouldn't be settled with food but with currency, and this investment was trivial in comparison.



The only problem was whether Longsong Stronghold was willing to give up its monopoly and engage in normal trade with Border Town—this was somewhat akin to snatching food from a tiger's mouth. However, the list of data provided by Barov indicated that, limited by the low efficiency of manpower mining and inconvenient transportation, the actual annual output value of the mines was only a little over a thousand Gold Royals, which was just a drop in the bucket for the stronghold's entire revenue. The only ones who would suffer were those nobles who had invested in partnerships.



For the long-term development of Border Town, this line of development had to be reclaimed. Roland was clear in his mind that even if those people's investments had been recouped more than a decade ago, they wouldn't let go easily. No matter how small, a mosquito is still meat, not to mention such a good thing that makes money without effort. He was willing to give certain concessions and compensation to the previous investors, such as buying at half price. But he would not allow things like taking a boatload of ore back in exchange for only half a boatload of food to happen again.



While Roland was pondering over the list, Barov was watching him.



In these three months, or to be precise, in the past month, there had been some indescribable changes in the Fourth Prince. Outsiders might not be aware, but Barov, who followed him every day, couldn't be fooled by the changes.



Back in Greycastle, he had heard of the notorious reputation of the Fourth Prince, Roland Wimbledon. Willful, reckless, lacking the grace of a noble... and so on. In short, he did not commit big mistakes, but was continuously making small ones, far worse than his two brothers.



When he was dispatched here by His Majesty, he was full of disappointment. If it weren't for the King's promise that after the battle for the throne ended, he would be appointed as the official Minister of Finance, Barov truly wanted to throw in the towel.



During the first two months of his arrival in Border Town, the Fourth Prince continued to display extremely childish behavior, offending all the local nobles he could. Fortunately, the town itself was very small, and even if all the administrative positions were vacated, he and the dozen or so civil officials he brought with him could fill them.



Going forward, some things became different.



When exactly did the change begin? He thought, probably... it started when he saved that witch.



Barov had not ruled out the possibility that the devil had possessed someone, or that the prince himself was being controlled by another hidden witch. However, the likelihood of that was extremely slim. If demons and witches had such power, why bother with the fourth prince? Wouldn't it be better to directly control His Majesty or the Pope? Another thing that dispelled his doubts was that he had witnessed the prince holding the God's Punishment Stone.



This device was the church's trump card against witches; any evil power would dissipate before the God's Punishment Stone, yet Roland held it directly. In other words, if he were not the fourth prince but a demon lord who did not even need to fear divine power, would there still be a need to expose him? Preserving his own life should be his top priority.



The prince's style remained willful and reckless, but the feelings they evoked in him were not the same. No, Barov thought, it should be said they were completely opposite.



The biggest difference seemed to be purposefulness. He noticed that Roland was planning something, and to achieve his goals, he had to employ some methods that ordinary people found hard to understand. Just like how he tried to convince him why it was necessary to save a witch. Perhaps the plan was not mature, full of holes, but the prince was indeed moving forward with his plan and was deeply convinced of its success.



This was the most puzzling part. The throne might emerge from any of Roland's siblings, but it would definitely not be the fourth prince himself. He should be very clear about this—talking about development in a small place like Border Town? Even the gods couldn't manage that, right? What kind of crazy plan had Roland conceived, crazy enough to make a small town outside the border defense line develop better than the city of Valencia, and to make him thoroughly believe that this plan would certainly succeed?



If it were just the delusions of a madman, that would be one thing, but the town walls Roland was vigorously building seemed to indicate otherwise. He really intended to settle down here, relying on "cement," an alchemical product, to build a wall that was almost impossible to complete in common sense.



Barov's family included alchemists, but he had never heard of an alchemy workshop producing such a thing. Basing a wall construction plan on something no one had ever seen, was this confidence or reckless action? Expanding to Roland's entire planned scheme, how much more did the fourth prince hide that he did not know? He found himself vaguely interested in the days to come.
