## Path Ahead
The fire in the fireplace burned brightly, driving away the chill seeping in through the cracks of the doors and windows. A large stag head with massive antlers hung above the fireplace, its shadows cast on the wall behind it by the firelight resembled enormous claws and fangs.

Opposite was a dark red long wooden table, covered with sheepskin scrolls and books, mostly administrative orders waiting to be signed. Normally, Roland would handle official duties right here—ever since he remodeled the third floor of the castle into an office, he had gradually grown fond of this place.

Through the floor-to-ceiling windows behind him, he could see the town stretching out before his eyes, with the endless mountains at the far end. Those were the Impassable Mountain Range, which almost spanned the continent, dividing the Kingdom of Greycastle and the Barbarian Lands to the east and west. The Northern Slope Mine was merely a branch of the Impassable Mountain Range.

Beneath his feet, he could see a garden enclosed by wooden fences. The wooden shed used for Anna's training had been dismantled, and the brick pool turned into a long table for the convenience of laying out tableware during afternoon tea. When the weather was good, he would also go down to bask in the sun or lie in a specially made rocking chair to nap.

Although the castle was not large, it could still be considered a medium-sized villa with its own private garden. In his previous life, owning a real stone-built castle was almost a fairy tale; even just visiting one would require a ticket purchase. But now, he not only owned this castle but also had control over a town.

"Your Highness, the recent recruitment of craftsmen and laborers has been quite costly, and this money is coming out of your pocket. At this rate, I'm afraid it won't last until next spring," Barov reported to Roland, pinching a stack of sheepskin papers, about the recent financial situation.

The original income and expenditure of Border Town were very simple, a single line of ore and gem trade. This line was monopolized by Longsong Stronghold, which exchanged the output of the Northern Slope Mine for wheat or bread without taxation, with the stronghold's people managing the resource exchange. Put simply, the Northern Slope Mine was a joint venture project of the Longsong Stronghold nobles. Those nobles stationed in Border Town could be regarded as supervisors sent by the shareholders, and their fiefs were mostly to the east of the stronghold, only residing here temporarily, and the people coming each year were always different.

In fact, the history of Border Town was less than thirty years, a mere infant compared to the nearly two hundred years of Longsong Stronghold. Originally, Duke Ryan had only intended to establish an outpost here as an early warning against demonic beast attacks. However, the pioneers unexpectedly discovered rich mineral resources in the Northern Slope Mountain Range, so they simply set up the town here and named it Border Town. In a sense, it was the Northern Slope Mine that made the town.

To prevent secret mining and underreporting, the Duke did not adopt the nobles' suggestion of sending their own people to mine, but instead hired local residents, nearby refugees, and even criminals as miners, with the output of ore distributed according to the proportion of resources invested by each family. The stronghold only needed to provide the hirelings with a year's worth of food and a small amount of money as compensation, which were fixed amounts and did not vary with the mine's yield. Most of Border Town's population of over two thousand served the mining area.

The other line was the town's other industries—such as blacksmiths, taverns, textiles, and so on. Border Town's meager tax revenue mainly came from here, and it was hard to have much left over at the end of the year. The previous lords didn't take this barren land seriously; ever since Roland was sent here by the King of Greycastle, he simply stayed in the stronghold and did not come over.

Therefore, if Roland wanted to hire people to repair the city walls, he could only pay out of his own pocket. If it were the previous fourth prince, he would certainly not be willing to do so, but for Roland, as long as he could gain a firm foothold in Border Town, it was worth spending all his wealth. After all, the future ore trade would no longer be settled with food, but with currency, so this investment was just a trifle.

The only issue was whether Longsong Stronghold would be willing to give up its monopoly and engage in normal trade with Border Town—this was somewhat like taking food from a tiger's mouth. However, the list of data provided by Barov indicated that, limited by the low efficiency of manpower mining and inconvenient transportation, the actual value of ore produced by the mine each year was only worth a thousand or so Gold Royals, which was a mere fraction of the stronghold's entire revenue. The only ones whose interests were harmed were those nobles who had invested in the partnership.

Considering the long-term development of Border Town, this line must be taken back. Roland was clear in his mind that even if those people had recouped their investments decades ago, they would not let go easily. No matter how small a mosquito is, it's still meat, especially when it comes to such easy money. He was willing to offer certain concessions and compensation to the previous investors, such as buying at half price. But transporting a shipload of ore back for only half a shipload of food was not to be allowed anymore.

As Roland stared at the list and pondered, Barov was also watching him.

Over the past three months, or rather, over the last month, some indescribable changes had taken place in the fourth prince. Outsiders might not be clear, but he followed the prince every day, and such changes could not escape his notice.

Back in Greycastle, he had heard of the infamy of the fourth prince, Roland Wimbledon. Self-willed, reckless, lacking the demeanor of a noble...and so on. In short, while not making any major mistakes, he was constantly erring, far behind his two brothers.

When His Majesty assigned him here, he had been full of disappointment, and had it not been for His Majesty's promise to appoint him as the official Minister of Finance after the struggle for the throne ended, he really would have thrown in the towel.
During the first two months after his arrival in Border Town, the Fourth Prince continued to demonstrate his extreme immaturity, offending every local noble he could. Fortunately, the town itself was very small, and even if all the administrative positions were vacated, he and the dozen or so civil servants he brought with him could fill the gaps.
After that, things started to change.
From when exactly did the change begin? He thought, probably… it was from the time he saved that witch.
Barov had not ruled out the possibility of possession by a devil, or that the prince himself was being manipulated by another hidden witch. But such a possibility was extremely slim. If devils and witches had such power, why target the Fourth Prince? Wouldn't it be better to control His Majesty or the Pope directly? Another point that dispelled his doubts was that he had seen the prince grasp the God's Punishment Army's Chains.
This object was the church's trump card against witches, any demonic power would dissipate in front of the God's Punishment Army's Chains, yet Roland had held it in his hand. In other words, if he was not the Fourth Prince, but a demon lord who did not even need to fear divine power, then what was the need for exposure? Preserving one's own life was the top priority.
The prince's style was still capricious and reckless, but the feeling they gave him was not the same. No, Barov thought about it, it was actually completely opposite.
The biggest difference was the purposefulness. He perceived that Roland was planning something, and to achieve his goal, he had to use some methods that ordinary people found difficult to understand. Just as he tried to persuade himself why he should save a witch, perhaps the plan was not mature and full of flaws, but the prince was indeed moving forward with the plan and was utterly convinced of the outcome.
That was the most puzzling part. The throne could be born from any of Roland's siblings, but it definitely would not be the Fourth Prince himself. He should be very clear about this, to talk about development in a small place like Border Town? Even gods couldn't manage that! What kind of crazy plan had Roland concocted, so crazy that it would allow a small town established outside the border defense line to develop better than Golden City, and also make him utterly convinced that this plan would definitely succeed?
If it was just the delusion of a madman, that would be one thing, but the walls that Roland was vigorously building seemed to indicate otherwise. He really intended to stay here, relying on 'cement,' an alchemical product, to build a wall that was almost impossible in common sense.
There were alchemists in Barov's family, but he had never heard of an alchemy workshop producing such a thing. Basing a wall-building plan on something no one had ever seen, was this confidence or reckless action? Extending to Roland's entire plan, how much more was the Fourth Prince hiding that he did not know about? He found himself vaguely interested in the days to come.
