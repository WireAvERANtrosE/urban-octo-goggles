## "The Gate"
"This is... how is this possible?" Thunder could not believe his eyes as he gaped.



Dozens of small holes had appeared on the wall, each hole containing a stone that emitted a pure white light. Not just that, even the edges of the ceiling were fitted with a ring of these strange luminous stones. Under their soft glow, every detail of the hall was clearly visible.



Ashes had never seen the explorer wear such an expression before, and she couldn't help feeling pleased, "You don't know? When a witch infuses her power into a magic stone, it can trigger additional abilities."



"Are these also magic stones?"

Thunder carefully picked up a luminous stone and held it in his hands. Even after being removed from the hole, its glow did not diminish in the slightest.



"I don't know," Tilly shook her head, "These stones might have been glowing here for hundreds of years—if the ruins truly have such a long history. They had always been hidden behind the stone slabs and thus remained undiscovered. Only a witch could activate this special mechanism."



"Weren't you the one who made them light up?"



"No, they can glow by themselves," Tilly picked up a magic stone and lifted it to her eyes, the pure white light illuminating her stunning face, "If this were a device that needed magic to maintain, then it wouldn't be possible to remove it so easily, just like a flame cannot easily leave a candle. For now, it seems that the holes in the wall, aside from holding the luminous stones, have no other special significance."



"If it really is as you say, capable of glowing on its own and lasting for hundreds of years, then its value is simply incalculable," Thunder marveled, "You should know that in the Kingdom of Everwinter, a fist-sized snow crystal stone can sell for hundreds of Gold Royals, yet its brightness is not even half of this."



Upon hearing such an astonishing price, the sailors' eyes instantly changed as they looked at those stones.



"As we agreed before, you can take half," Tilly said noncommittally, or rather her focus was not on this at all. With ample lighting, she could explore the hall more carefully. Ashes couldn't bear to watch her tear off the seaweeds piece by piece, so she simply swung her greatsword, sweeping off the wall-clinging plants like mowing grass. Soon, the second magic stone hidden within the wall was discovered.



Tilly applied magic to it in the same manner. Accompanied by a crisp metallic clanking sound, everyone was surprised to see a huge stone slab above Tilly's head tilt and descend, with several taut copper ropes on either side, and steps that had been carved out on the inside. Eventually, one end of the stone slab slowly fell to the ground, while the other end led to the ceiling. Looking up, Ashes saw a horizontal metal door blocking the end of the passage.



"Tilly," seeing the fifth princess unhesitatingly walk up the stone steps, Ashes couldn't help but speak out, "Let me go first."



"It's okay, this is not some... treasure hideout." She climbed to the top of the stone steps, grabbed a protruding magic stone next to the door, and the metal door quickly opened in response.



Seeing Tilly crawl through the door, disappearing into the ceiling, Ashes had no other choice but to follow closely, with the greatsword gripped in her hand.



Passing through the ceiling, Ashes couldn't help but widen her eyes. Above the ceiling was a room much smaller than the hall, with glowing stones embedded in the walls—what surprised her even more was that there were almost no traces of water damage.



Wooden tables, chairs, bookshelves, cabinets... everything was intact, covered with a thick layer of dust, and one could even see the remnants of broken cobwebs. A row of books was neatly placed on the bookshelf, all turned grey by dust. On the table, apart from the spread-out books, there were also cups, a pot, and a pen stand, with only a lonely pen shaft remaining, and the ink had long since dried up. Compared to the hall below, filled with algae and shells, it was like a completely different world.



Thunder was the third to climb up, and after looking around, he took a sharp breath, "This is..."



"The Abandoned Residence," Tilly picked up a book from the table, gently tapped off the dust, and flipped through the pages, "Someone once lived here for a long time."

"What does it say?"

"I can't understand it," she shook her head, spreading the book open to show the two of them, "It's all characters I've never seen before."

"It seems the same with the books on the shelves." Ashes wiped the dust off the spines with her finger, the characters looked like strange wavy lines, completely unreadable.

"We can take them back to study slowly," Tilly laughed, "as per the agreement, the books and magic stones are all mine."

"Of course," Thunder stroked his beard, "but when you make a discovery, I hope you can share this ancient tale with me."

"No problem."

...

The three of them carefully searched the second-floor room, quickly getting a general understanding of the situation.



They did not find any new magic stones; instead, they discovered an oddly shaped object at the other end of the room—it looked like a thick metal tube at first glance. One end was embedded into the stone wall, while the other end tapered off in sections, ending with the thickness of a wrist, with a piece of glass lens embedded at the tip.



"What is this?" Ashes tapped on the body of the tube, and a series of crisp echoes came from inside—clearly, the tube was hollow in the middle.



"It's a bit like a lookout telescope used for navigation. Perhaps the person who lived here used it to observe the outside world," Thunder said as he peered beside the lens for a while, "It's pitch black… I can't see anything; it must be broken."



"Not necessarily," Tilly pointed at the wall behind the metal tube, "Look here."



Ashes followed the direction of her finger and saw a copper plate embedded in the wall, complete with a handle and a small hole underneath that seemed to be for inserting a key. Princess Tilly walked over and tried to pull the handle, but the copper plate did not budge, "It's locked."



"Let me try." Ashes grabbed the handle and pulled hard, and the entire copper plate fell off the wall.



"Ha, it looks like you guessed right," Thunder clapped his hands, "Another magic stone mechanism."



A huge magic stone was stuck in the recess behind the copper plate, and unlike the first two, it looked much larger and was more purple in color.



"Should we activate it?" Ashes asked.



"Right." Tilly nodded without hesitation, her hands grasping the stone, but this time there was no activity for a long while.

"What's happening?"

"It's... too large," beads of sweat had appeared on her forehead, "I can feel that it's continuously drawing magic power, as if the mechanism behind it is very massive."

"Let's just forget it." Ashes frowned. She knew that once magic power was exhausted, a witch could easily fall into a coma, and using up all their magic power in such a dangerous place obviously wasn't a wise choice.

"No, it's almost done, I can feel it." Before Tilly could finish her sentence, a huge noise came from within the wall, like continuous thunder, and then the entire room began to shake.

"Is this... an earthquake?" Thunder braced himself against a metal pipe to prevent himself from falling, while Ashes immediately grabbed Tilly, holding her in her arms. Dust fluttered down, and the three of them couldn't help but cough.

The shaking continued for nearly a quarter of an hour before gradually returning to calm.

Molly poked her head out from the stairwell, "What just happened?"

"A new mechanism," Ashes curled her lip, "Is everything okay down there?"



Everyone was terrified, and several ceiling panels had fallen, but fortunately, I covered them with my magic servile." The little girl came over. "Lady Tilly, what are you looking at?"



Unexpectedly, Tilly did not answer her. She kept her eyes glued to the end of the metal tube and took a long time before she finally let out a long breath, "It's simply inconceivable..."



Ashes curiously moved her eyes closer, and then was so shocked by the scene in front of her that she was rendered speechless.



At the other end of the "telescope" emerged a vast expanse of land, the edges of which were like cliffs, bottomless at a glance. And in the center of the cliff stood an immensely huge stone arch, deep and dark within, like a giant maw choosing its victim.
