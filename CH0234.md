## "Gate"
"This is... how is this possible?" Thunder could not believe his eyes, his mouth agape.



Dozens of small holes had appeared on the wall, each filled with a stone emitting a pure white light. Not only that, but a row of these bizarre luminous stones had also been installed along the edge of the ceiling. Under their soft glow, every detail of the hall was clearly visible.



This was the first time Ashes had seen the explorer with such an expression, and a sense of pleasure arose within her. "Don't you know? When witches infuse their power into magic stones, they can evoke additional abilities."



"Are these also magic stones?"



Thunder carefully picked up a luminous stone and held it in his hand. Its light did not diminish at all after being removed from the hole.



"I don't know," Tilly shook her head, "These stones might have been shining here for hundreds of years—if the ruins are indeed that old. They were hidden behind the slabs before, so they were never discovered. And to activate this special mechanism, only a witch could do it."



"It wasn't you who made them light up?"



"No, they can shine on their own," Tilly picked up a magic stone and held it up to her eyes. The white light illuminated her stunning face. "If this were a device that required magic to maintain, then it wouldn't be possible to remove it so easily, just as a flame cannot easily leave a candle. For now, it seems that the holes in the wall, aside from holding the luminous stones, don't have any other special function."



"If what you say is true, that it can light up on its own and can last for hundreds of years, then its value is immeasurable," Thunder marveled. "You should know that the snow crystals produced by the Kingdom of Eternal Winter, a piece the size of a fist can sell for hundreds of Gold royals, and yet its brightness is not even half of this."



Upon hearing such an astonishing price, the sailors' gaze towards those stones changed instantly.

"According to what we agreed earlier, you can take half," Tilly said noncommittally, or rather, her focus was not there at all. With sufficient lighting, she could explore the hall more carefully. Ashes couldn't bear to watch her tear off the seaweed piece by piece, so she simply swung her great sword, sweeping all the plants off the walls like mowing grass. Soon, the second magic stone hidden in the wall was also discovered.



Tilly employed the same method to infuse the stone with magic power. Accompanied by the crisp sound of metal clashing, everyone was amazed to see a massive stone slab above Tilly's head tilting down, with several taut copper wires on both sides, and the inner side turned out to be a carved staircase. Eventually, one end of the stone slab slowly fell to the ground, while the other led to the top of the ceiling. Ashes looked up to see a horizontally placed metal door blocking the end of the passage.



"Tilly," Ashes couldn't help but speak up as the fifth princess ascended the stone stairs without hesitation, "Let me go first."



"It's okay, this is not some... treasure trove." She climbed to the top of the stone stairs, grasped a protruding magic stone beside the door, and the metal door quickly opened in response.



Seeing Tilly crawl through the door and disappear into the ceiling, Ashes had no other choice but to follow closely, gripping her great sword in hand.



Passing through the top panel, Ashes couldn't help but widen her eyes. Above the ceiling was a room much smaller than the hall, with walls also embedded with luminous stones—what surprised her even more was that there were almost no traces of water damage.



Wooden tables, chairs, bookshelves, cabinets... everything was intact, covered with thick dust, and even broken spider webs could be seen. The bookshelves were neatly lined with a row of books, all dyed gray with dust. On the table, besides the open books, there were also cups, a water pot, and a pen holder. Only a single featherless quill remained, and the ink had long since dried up. Compared to the hall below, full of algae and shells, it was like a different world.



Thunder was the third to climb up, and after looking around, he drew in a breath of cold air, "This place is..."



"The abandoned residence," Tilly picked up a book from the table, gently dusting it off, flipping through the pages, "Someone lived here for a quite a long time."

"What does it say?"

"I can't understand it," she shook her head and spread the book open for the two to see, "It's all in characters I've never seen before."

"It seems to be the same with the books on the shelf." Ashes wiped the dust off the spine of a book with her finger; the text was like strange wavy lines, completely incomprehensible.

"We can take it back and study it slowly," Tilly laughed, "according to the agreement, the books and magic stones are all mine."

"Of course," Roland stroked his beard, "but when you do make a discovery, I hope you can share this ancient story with me."

"No problem."

...

The three of them carefully searched the second-floor room, quickly getting a general understanding of the situation.



They did not find a new magic stone; instead, they discovered a strangely shaped object at the other end of the room—it looked like a thick metal tube at first glance. One end of it was embedded into the stone wall, while the other end tapered off in sections, ultimately no thicker than a wrist, with a piece of glass lens embedded at the end.



"What's this?" Ashes tapped on the body of the tube, and a series of crisp echoes came from within—clearly, the tube was hollow in the middle.



"It somewhat resembles a lookout telescope used for navigation. Perhaps the people who lived here used it to observe the outside world," Thunder said, peering into the lens for a while. "It's pitch black... can't see a thing, must be broken."



"Not necessarily," Tilly pointed at the wall behind the metal tube, "Look here."



Ashes followed the direction of her finger and saw a copper plate embedded in the wall with a handle on it, and there was a small hole beneath the handle, seemingly for a key to be inserted. The fifth princess walked over and tried to pull on the handle, but the plate didn't budge, "It's locked."



"Let me try," said Ashes, grabbing the handle and pulling hard, and the entire copper plate immediately fell off the wall.



"Ha, looks like you guessed right," Thunder applauded, "Another magic stone mechanism."



A huge magic stone was wedged into the groove behind the copper plate; unlike the previous two, it was much larger and its color tended more towards purple.



"Should we activate it?" Ashes asked.



"Um." Tilly nodded without hesitation, her hands gripping the stone, but this time there was a long silence without any movement.

"What's going on?"

"It's... too large," beads of sweat appeared on her forehead, "I can feel it continuously drawing magic power, as if the mechanism behind it is very massive."

"Maybe we should stop," Ashes frowned. She knew that once the magic power was exhausted, the witch was likely to fall directly into a coma, and spending all their magic power in such a dangerous place was clearly not a good choice.

"No, it's almost done, I can feel it." Tilly's words had just ended when a huge noise came from within the wall, like continuous thunder, and then the whole room began to shake.

"Is this... an earthquake?" Thunder braced himself on the metal pipe to prevent falling, while Ashes immediately grabbed Tilly, pulling her into her arms. Dust fluttered down, and all three couldn't help but start coughing.

The shaking lasted for nearly a quarter of an hour before it gradually returned to calm.

Molly poked her head out from the stairwell, "What just happened?"

"A new mechanism," Ashes curled her lip, "Is everything alright down there?"



"Everyone was terrified, and there were several collapses of the ceiling, but thankfully I shielded them with my magic servants," the little girl approached, "Lady Tilly, what are you looking at?"



Surprisingly, Tilly did not answer her, her eyes glued to the end of the metal tube for a long time before she finally let out a long breath, "It's simply inconceivable..."



Ashes curiously peered over, and was left speechless by the sight in front of her.



Through the other end of the "telescope," a vast expanse of land emerged, with the edge like a cliff that seemed bottomless at a glance. And in the middle of the cliff stood an enormously huge stone archway, its interior deep and dark, like a giant maw choosing its victim to devour.
