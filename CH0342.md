## Countermeasure
"I'll join too," Lightning rushed up.

"Me as well," Nana clamored.

"Coo!" Maggie followed closely behind.

Roland simply stood still, allowing every member of the Witch Union to hug him in turn, prompting Tilly to chuckle, "You really have a good relationship with them, don't you?"

"Do you need a hug from your brother too?"

"No, thanks," she replied with a laugh, shaking her head, "I still clearly remember the time you picked me up and then dropped me on the ground."

Roland could only shrug innocently, then turned his attention to the woman in Ashes' arms—with sea-blue hair, she looked quite young and had a figure similar to Anna's. Her eyes were closed, her long eyebrows slightly upturned, her skin fair, and the teardrop mole at the corner of her eye was particularly striking.

Judging by her appearance alone, she didn't look like a prisoner trapped in the basement of a stone tower, but rather had the air of a sleeping beauty.

However, more than her appearance, what caught Roland's attention was her robe—in this era, he rarely saw clothing with such intricate and elaborate patterns. Due to the scarcity of dyes, the purple base color of the robe was exceptionally rare, and paired with those interlaced white stripes and sigils, it looked like a magnificent robe that one would only see in a movie.



This must be an orange equipment.

"Is she still alive?"

"Yes," Nightingale said, "but the magic power in her body has been depleted, a bit like the situation Anna encountered when she came of age. However, unlike Anna, her magic power recovery rate is very slow. At this rate, it might take three to four days to return to normal levels."

"In that case, let's call her the Sleeper for now," Roland nodded, "I will clear out a room for her on the third floor of the castle to recover, the rest of you can go back to the hall," he paused, "I would like to hear the story of your journey."

...

After listening to the recounting by Tilly and Nightingale, Roland couldn't help but feel a chill on their behalf.

Despite having Sylvie's full map, it was still extremely dangerous to pursue a huge demonic beast underground that they had never seen before. If it were him, he might have hesitated. Unexpectedly, Tilly was so decisive, quickly selecting the right people and personally leading the team... It could be said that her becoming the leader of the many witches was not solely due to her status as a princess.

"Did you think at the time that this burrowing worm was related to the devils?"

"I don't know, but it's not impossible," Tilly said slowly, "The witches of the Union have encountered devils in the Fertile Plains riding on mixed-breed demonic beasts. Their flesh wings were cut off, and they obeyed the devils' commands, a bit like domesticated livestock. And behind the Impassable Mountain Range, you also saw flying creatures—completely different from the form of the devils, perhaps another type of demonic beast."



"So, can we speculate that demons and demonic beasts have a subordinate relationship, like humans and hunting dogs? They can use some method to make these monsters obey their commands, driving them to complete some more difficult tasks?"

"It does feel that way." Roland nodded, but he always had a bundle of incomprehensible confusion in his heart. Demonic beasts only actively attack human settlements during the Evil Months, but that doesn't mean they can only live during the Evil Months—the moss and weeds on the shell of the siege beasts are proof that these monsters can survive for decades. If demons are limited by the Red Mist and cannot quickly occupy the entire wasteland, driving humans completely out of the continent, then they could continuously send demonic beasts to harass the Four Kingdoms instead of waiting until winter to act.



Another point is... he couldn't forget the intelligence displayed by the wolf-lion hybrid that had attacked Iron Axe during the first Evil Months—unlike "smart" animals with conditioned reflexes, it could learn, analyze, choose routes and targets, a level of intelligence that most creatures couldn't reach. If the long-lived hybrid demonic beasts all possessed intelligence, it would be impossible for them to be tamed by another species.



"However, I think the enemies Miss Nightingale encountered outside the stone tower are more worrying than the demonic beasts underground," Tilly sighed, "They can hide their forms during the day, move stealthily, and are nearly invincible. Unfortunately, we know too little about demonic beasts and have no idea how to deal with such a terrifying opponent."



"If it weren't for Nightingale's own eyes, I wouldn't want to believe such demonic beasts really exist," Roland spread his hands, "But they seem to have never appeared in the Western Region... otherwise, if a few of them came every winter, the Longsong Stronghold would have become ruins long ago."



"But the longer the Evil Months, the stronger the demonic beasts become, that's the conclusion of the history books. This time it started snowing in autumn, the enemies we face might be very powerful."



This "we" warmed Roland's heart, whether or not she considered him a brother, at least as an ally, she had already seen the town and himself as one—of course, this was for the sake of the witches.



"Then we can only leave the surveillance of the defense line to Nightingale."



"No, let Sylvie take care of the vigilance this winter," Tilly said, "The city wall is divided into two sections, east and west, and even making a round would take half an hour, Miss Nightingale's workload is too great. Sylvie just needs to stay in the castle, and she can observe the entire wall area. If she finds demonic beasts, she can also immediately notify the other witches."



"That's fine," Roland nodded.

"That witch..." Scroll hesitated, "I still hold my previous opinion, she could be our enemy until her identity is confirmed."

"I know, so I will temporarily put her in the Shackles of Holy Punishment," he exhaled, "I hope this won't cause her to misunderstand us."

...

Roland entered the bedroom of the sleeping witch, where only Anna was left taking care of her.

"How is she?"

Anna shook her head, "Still no response."

"Is that so." Roland walked to the bedside, the woman lay quietly under the covers, and although her eyes were still tightly closed, the frown between her brows seemed to have faded somewhat. Nana and Lily had both used their powers on her, all that remained was to wait quietly.

"It's incredible that after being frozen for so long, there's not a single trace left on her body," he marveled.



"Just as I'm not afraid of flames," Anna chuckled lightly, "her ability must be related to this."

"I heard it was you who cut open the ice coffin," Roland patted her head, "Impressive, Anna."

"It wasn't all because of me," she said earnestly, "this witch used her power very cleverly. She first used extremely cold ice to freeze all her body's circulation, then sealed the ice completely inside with ice crystals close to room temperature, to prevent it from dissipating and melting. Her control over her power must have reached a very high level."

Ice crystals close to room temperature... The notion sounded quite illogical, but Roland understood that the abilities of summoning witches were concrete manifestations of magic, just like the black fire that could freely change shape and temperature.

Anna paused, then continued, "As soon as I cut into the outer layer of the ice crystals, the entire ice coffin immediately shattered into pieces, as if she had intentionally left that flaw. So I think, she must have foreseen this day coming."

"You mean..."

"She will definitely wake up."
