## Age of Firearms
Iron Axe knew that he was being monitored. 

On the day of the test explosion, all the hunters involved were concentrated in a two-story building near the castle. Looking out through the window, he could see a circle of stone walls, with guards at the entrance and exit.

He didn't care about this at all, and even felt that His Highness had been too careless by only sending two personal guards to watch over them.

Even now, the roar of the explosion that day was still lingering in Iron Axe's mind - never had a weapon brought him such a strong shock. In the extreme south, he had seen the orange flames erupting from underground that could burn for decades; he had also seen the winds and waves that covered the sky at the end of the endless sea... However, the power of nature was unpredictable, those were the will of Mother Earth or the Sea God, the iron whip used by the gods to punish all living creatures.

Yet Prince His Highness, with his personal power, had stolen the authority of the three gods and obtained a power like divine punishment - although it was still far from the true thunder of the Heavenly Father, it was already beyond the reach of human power.

If this were in Iron Sand City, participants who still had uses would generally have their tongues cut off. Of course, this was not the safest method, only a dead man could keep secrets forever. As for the foreigners? It would be a desecration for them to even glance at it, and it was absolutely impossible for a foreigner to join the core ranks of the Mojin tribe.

The prince knew he was of mixed blood, yet he still allowed him to witness the fire of divine punishment with his own eyes and even planned to have him in charge of forming a hunting team. This kind of trust made Iron Axe's blood boil.

In Iron Sand City, he had experienced countless betrayals and traps. He fled to the southern border of Greycastle, where his blood was half Sand People and half mainland people, which made him suffer a lot of discrimination. In the end, he came to Border Town in despair, planning to live out his life by hunting, but he did not expect to be favored by Prince His Highness here.

He had no doubt that with this new weapon, the one to win the King's Order would certainly be His Highness Roland Wimbledon.



The thought of having the opportunity to serve the future king filled Iron Axe with excitement.

"All men, assemble downstairs!"

Hearing the call, Iron Axe peeked out to see that the man who had come was Carter Lannis, the chief knight of the Fourth Prince.

He made himself presentable in a jiffy, hurried downstairs, and stood at attention before Carter. Having participated in the militia training, he knew that His Highness preferred disciplined and orderly troops. The other hunters were much slower; it took about six people about a quarter of an hour to line up.

"Follow me to the usual place," Carter said, seemingly unconcerned. He led the group out the door and straight to the city wall.

The location was the same as the previous explosion test site, only this time there was no cordon.

Apart from Roland, there were four knights at the scene — all of them were under Carter. Iron Axe noticed that Prince His Highness was fiddling with a peculiarly shaped metal rod in his hand, explaining something to the knights.

When they saw Iron Axe and his group, Roland came over, "How are you? Are you used to your new place yet?"

"Thank you for your concern, Your Highness." The men bowed and expressed their satisfaction with their new accommodations.



In fact, the newly moved residence was much better than the old house before, Iron Axe thought. At least it wouldn't leak wind or rain, and the roof was not made of transparent straw, but neat tiles.

"That's good," Roland nodded, "The current arrangement is for safety reasons. After the Evil Months end, you will be able to move back. Also, I have already given the first month's salary to your families and you will also be able to meet them once a week. Of course, under the escort of the guards."

"Thank you for your kindness, Your Highness," the hunters said enthusiastically.

This surprised Iron Axe a bit. Leaving aside the iron rule of Sand People, even the management of the Greycastle army shouldn't be so lax. Could it be because of the prince's personal tolerance? He was a little worried. To vie for the throne, one must be ruthless. This point, he had seen too much in Iron Sand City.

However, when the fourth prince said that he was going to test a new weapon based on gunpowder, Iron Axe immediately threw these worries behind his head. He stared unblinkingly as the prince brought two oddly shaped iron sticks in front of everyone.

"This thing is called a 'firearm'," Roland said, "Next, I'll tell you how to use it."

...

It only took Iron Axe half an hour to fully understand the usage of the new weapon.

Pour the black powder that can attract heavenly punishment fire, also known as gunpowder, into the barrel, stuff in a lead ball, use the ramrod to push it to the bottom, then pour gunpowder into the rear powder chamber, aim at the target, and pull the trigger.



Although he had always believed himself to have a knack for killing, being proficient in the use of swords, knives, hammers, axes, and spears, these were skills he had mastered through years of training and actual combat. To master a weapon in half an hour, probably only the crossbow could compare in terms of speed.

The other firearm was handed over to Carter.

The Chief Knight was also very interested in this novel weapon, and didn't want to put it down after picking it up.

After a few rounds of simulated operation, Roland let the two of them try live fire to see the effect. The targets had been prepared long ago, a half-body plate armor propped up with wooden sticks, stood about thirty feet (approximately 10 meters) away by two other knights.

Iron Axe and Carter, following the prince's described shooting method, leveled their aim, and pulled the triggers.

The loud bang of the first shot startled everyone present, including Iron Axe, but soon the only expression left on everyone's faces was astonishment.

On the half-body plate armor that served as the target, a small hole appeared. The lead bullet cleanly pierced through the thickest part of the plate armor's chest.

Before the shooting, Iron Axe had carefully observed this piece of armor. It was obviously not some inferior product made by a handcraft workshop. The marks of the hammer and anvil at the collar proved that it was a standard armor from the Greycastle Blacksmith's Guild, with the thickest part at the front edge being about half a finger, enough to resist a direct shot from a crossbow at close range. To deal with this kind of iron can, a heavy crossbow, a war hammer, or a long halberd would be the sensible choice.

Comparatively, the equally easy-to-use firearm was far superior to the crossbow in terms of power. Its loading speed was similar to that of a crossbow, and as for accuracy... a thirty-foot target didn't say much about that.



"Your Highness, the production of this item..." Carter began to ask.

"Currently, there are only these two. At most, two more can be produced during the Evil Months."

Iron Axe saw Carter visibly breathe a sigh of relief. He could roughly guess the other's thoughts. If such a weapon was easy to produce, with just a few days of basic training, a large number of 'warriors' could be quickly trained to go into battle with muskets. They could be of any age, any occupation, even any gender—even frail women could pose a huge threat to knights.

Though it was not as shocking as the divine punishment fire, it was still a decent weapon, Iron Axe thought. Its great power would allow him to easily kill some large, sturdy demonic beasts from the city walls. If he had had a musket when he was facing the mixed breeds, the outcome might not have been so embarrassing. 

Only Roland on the scene clearly understood the true significance of this weapon.

He personally unveiled the prelude to the era of hot weapons.
