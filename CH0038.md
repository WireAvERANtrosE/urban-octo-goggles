## Age of Hot Weapons
Iron Axe knew he was being watched.

On the day of the trial explosion, all the hunters involved were moved into a two-story building near the castle. Looking out the window, one could see a circle of stone walls, with guards at the entrance and exit.

He didn't mind at all, and even felt that His Highness was being imprudent for only sending two personal guards to watch over them.

Even now, the roar of the explosion still lingered in Iron Axe's mind—never before had a weapon given him such a strong shock. In the far south, he had seen the orange fire that spewed from the ground, capable of burning for decades; he had also seen the sky-darkening storms and giant waves at the Endless Cape... But the might of heaven was unpredictable, the will of the Mother Earth or the Sea God, a divine whip used to punish all creatures.

Yet His Highness had, with his own power, stolen the authority of the three gods, obtaining a power like divine retribution—although it still fell far short of the true Father's thunder, it was beyond what humans could achieve.

In Iron Sand City, if participants were still of use, they would usually have their tongues cut out. Of course, that wasn't the safest method, only the dead can keep secrets forever. As for foreigners? A single glance from them was blasphemy, and they could never possibly join the core ranks of the Mojin Clan.

The Prince knew he was of half foreign blood, yet still allowed him to witness the divine fire of retribution and even planned to put him in charge of organizing the hunting teams. This trust made Iron Axe's blood surge with warmth.

In Iron Sand City, he had been through countless betrayals and traps. Escaping to the southern border of Greycastle, his mixed blood of Sand People and the people of the mainland subjected him to endless discrimination. Disheartened, he came to Border Town, intending to rely on hunting for the rest of his life, never expecting to end up favored by the Prince.

He had no doubt that with this new weapon, the one who would surely win the Battle of Succession was Prince Roland Wimbledon.



Excited by the opportunity to serve the future king, Iron Axe was thrilled.



"All hands, assemble downstairs!"



Hearing the call, Iron Axe poked his head out and saw that the arrival was the Chief Knight, Carter Lannis.



He quickly tidied up his attire and hurried downstairs, coming to attention in front of Carter. Iron Axe had participated in the militia's training and knew His Highness preferred strict discipline and uniform troops. The other hunters were much slower, taking about half a quarter of an hour to form ranks.



"The usual place, follow me." Carter didn't seem to mind and led the group out the door, heading straight for the city wall.



It was the same location as the last explosion test, only this time there was no cordon.



Apart from Roland, there were four knights on the scene— all were Carter's subordinates. Iron Axe noticed that Prince Roland was fiddling with an oddly shaped long metal rod while explaining something to the knights.



Seeing Iron Axe and his group, Roland approached them, "How is it going, getting used to the new place?"



"Thank you for your concern, Your Highness." Everyone bowed and expressed that their new homes were very comfortable.



In fact, the new residence was much better than the old house, Iron Axe thought. At least it wouldn't leak air or rain, and the roof wasn't made of light-penetrating straw but neat tiles.



"That's good," Roland nodded. "The current arrangement is for safety reasons. After the Evil Months are over, you can move back. Also, I've already issued the first month's salary to your family members, and you'll also be able to see them once a week on weekends. Of course, under the escort of the guards."



"Thank you for your kindness, Your Highness," the hunters said cheerfully.



This was quite unexpected for Iron Axe. Setting aside the iron laws of the Sand People, even the management of the Greycastle's army should not be so lax. Could it be because of the prince's personal indulgence? He felt a vague concern. To fight for the throne, one must be ruthless—this he had seen far too often in Ironsand City.



However, when the fourth prince mentioned that he would test a new weapon developed based on gunpowder, Iron Axe immediately put these worries behind him. He stared unblinkingly as the prince brought two oddly shaped iron sticks in front of everyone.



"This thing is called a 'musket,'" Roland said. "Next, I'll tell you how to use it."



...



Iron Axe had completely mastered the use of the new weapon in just half an hour.



Pour the black powder that could bring down the punishment of heaven's fire—gunpowder—into the barrel, stuff in a lead ball, push it down to the bottom with a ramrod, pour gunpowder into the rear powder chamber, aim at the target, and pull the trigger.



Although he believed that he always had a talent for killing, be it with a sword, knife, hammer, axe, or spear, he could use them all proficiently, but that was only after years of training and actual combat. To master a weapon within half an hour was a feat perhaps only comparable to a hand crossbow.



The other musket was handed over to Carter.



The Chief Knight was equally interested in this novel weapon and was reluctant to put it down once he picked it up.



After a few rounds of simulated operation, Roland let the two of them live-fire to see the effect. The target had already been prepared: a half-body suit of armor supported by wooden sticks, set up by two other knights at a distance of about thirty feet (approximately 10 meters).



Iron Axe and Carter followed the prince's described shooting method, holding the gun level, aiming, and pulling the trigger.



The loud bang of the first shot startled everyone present, including Iron Axe, but soon surprise was the only expression left on their faces.



A small hole appeared in the half-body suit of armor that served as the target. The lead ball had cleanly pierced through the thickest part of the armor's chest.



Before the shooting, Iron Axe had carefully examined the armor. It was clearly not some inferior product crafted by a workshop. The marks of the forging hammer and anvil on the collar area proved that it was a standard-issue armor from Greycastle's Blacksmiths Guild, with the thickest part at the front edge being about half a finger thick, enough to withstand a direct shot from a hand crossbow at close range. To deal with such iron armor, heavy crossbows, war hammers, or long spears were the wise choices.



In such a comparison, the equally easy-to-operate musket was at least far superior in power to the hand crossbow. Its loading speed was comparable to that of a hand crossbow, and as for accuracy... the thirty-foot target didn't prove much.



"Your Highness, about the production of this item..." Carter asked.

"At present, there are only these two. When the Evil Months come, at most two more will be produced."

Iron Axe saw Carter visibly relax. He could roughly guess what the other was thinking; if such a weapon were easy to manufacture, it would only take a few days of simple training to cultivate a large group of makeshift 'warriors' wielding muskets into battle. They would not be limited by age, profession, or even gender—even the frailest of women could pose a significant threat to any knights.

Although it wasn't as shocking as the earlier gunpowder test, it was still a fine weapon, Iron Axe thought. Its tremendous power would allow one to easily kill some large, tough demonic beasts from atop the city walls. If he had had a musket back when facing the mixed breeds, the outcome might not have been so dire.

And only Roland knew the true significance of this weapon.

He had personally lifted the curtain on the era of firearms warfare.
