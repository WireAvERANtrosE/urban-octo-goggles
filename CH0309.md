## The Pursuit of Knowledge
On the second day of mid-autumn, Roland received a secret letter from the capital.

The letter, delivered by a flying messenger, was nine times out of ten from his personal guard, Tassa.

Unwinding the paper from the bird’s claw, Roland walked to the window and began to read it carefully in the bright sunlight.

"Respected Your Highness, your plan has achieved astonishing success."

"Since the palace was quickly sealed off and no one was allowed to enter or exit, I was unable to find out the exact effect of the explosion. However, by evening, almost all the residents knew about the attack on the palace. Whether in taverns, inns, or in the squares, wherever people gathered, there was only one topic of conversation. Even the death of the former king did not have such a sensational impact. Coupled with the warning you issued earlier, now many believe that Timothy has perished in this attack, and that you will soon reign over the capital and become the new ruler of Greycastle."

This information allowed Roland to completely relax—the bombing mission was completed successfully, and the witch returned safely. There was no better news than this.

After making himself a cup of tea, he returned to his mahogany desk to continue reading.

"However, according to the intelligence we have gathered so far, there has been no movement from the major noble territories outside the capital, and the palace’s response was very swift, which leads me to speculate that Timothy Wimbledon is likely still alive."

"Moreover, some people are confidently claiming that the attack came from the sky. Some residents witnessed a pale white object falling from the heavens, plunging into the palace at a tremendous speed. Therefore, I have already come up with a preliminary plan for the task you entrusted to me—if we can portray this event as divine punishment you inflicted on the false king for his tyranny, I believe many will take it as the truth."



"My subordinates are quite enthusiastic about this; they have already collected plenty of evidence of Timothy's brutal actions on regular days. Now mixing it all together, it should be even more effective. I believe that in less than a month, these messages will be spread to every citizen's ears through the street rats."

"Additionally, I will continue to closely monitor the movements of the military camp in the eastern suburbs, but judging from the current situation, Timothy should be too preoccupied to deal with anything else until he comes up with countermeasures against the attacks."

The letter ended without a signature. After reading it, Roland folded the secret letter neatly and placed it in the drawer, letting out a long sigh.

If the First Army could really deter Timothy from sending troops, that would be great.

After all, it's a sheer waste to consume a large population in drug-induced combat. The later the enemy starts the war of attrition, the more time I will have to rally more people to my cause.

Roland picked up his cup and took a sip of the fragrant tea. What he needed to do next was to wait patiently for the witches to return.

He hadn't seen Anna for several days, and no one had taken the dried fish from the drawer; he was starting to feel a little uncomfortable.

Just then, Carter pushed open the door of the office.

"Your Highness, two fleets have arrived at the docks."



"The Margaret Chamber of Commerce has arrived, hasn't it? Considering the time spent on the road, she missed quite a show... Wait," Roland paused slightly, "another fleet?"



"Yes," Carter laughed, "the envoy group you sent to the Southern Territory to recruit people has returned with a group. The refugees they brought nearly filled the docks. The City Hall is implementing the plan you established, along with Miss Lily, that is..."



"Quarantine work."



"Right, right, to eliminate any potential demonic plague..." the Chief Knight coughed twice, "there are about four to five hundred people in this group."



"Is that so?" Roland couldn't help but curl his lips upward, he had just been thinking about this, and now there were results; it seems that the temporary housing Lian is in charge of will need to be increased again, "Let's go take a look."



...



Kamol Stewart put down the thin, tattered scroll, repeating a phrase over and over, "So that's how it is."



"Teacher?" Charms asked with some concern.



Ever since he got a hold of this book, "Intermediate Chemistry," Kamol had gone two days without sleep, almost tirelessly perusing the entire ancient tome. He too had glanced at it a few times, but the content was so profound that it was simply beyond comprehension.



"I'm doing well." The voice of the Chief Alchemist betrayed no sign of fatigue; on the contrary, he was full of energy. Although there were traces of sleep in the corners of his eyes, his gaze was bright and alert, not at all like someone who had gone without sleep for the entire night.



One must not carelessly interrupt a mentor while they are engrossed in alchemy research; this was a rule that a disciple should follow. Only now did Chames dare to ask, "This book... I don't understand it. What are atoms, and what are electrons?"



"You are already a qualified alchemist; you should no longer refer to yourself as a disciple. According to His Highness, we are now colleagues," Kyle paused for a moment, "As for your question, I don't know how to answer it... In fact, when Prince Roland gave me 'Intermediate Chemistry,' he also handed me this book."



Chames looked at another book on the table, which bore the title "Fundamentals of Natural Science Theory."



"Sir Scroll..." He was somewhat uncomfortable with this address, "It seems to have nothing to do with alchemy... no, chemistry."



"I originally thought so too," Kyle said, stroking his beard with a sense of wonder, "but after flipping through a few pages, I realized that I actually knew nothing about this world."



"What?" Chames was stunned. Knew nothing? Alchemists study the composition of matter, the essence of the elements—if even they knew nothing, then what was the difference between other people and monkeys?



"I'm talking about concepts," the voice of the Chief Alchemist was filled with excitement... and satisfaction, "We thought alchemy was just alchemy, a study of substances, that the rising and setting of the sun, the blooming and wilting of flowers, had nothing to do with us."



"Isn't that the case... Observing the sun and stars is what astrologers excel at, and as for plants," Chames said with slight disdain, "only farmers and herbalists would study those."



"So it turns out we know nothing," Kyle shook his head and said, "This book attempts to link everything together from the very beginning, whether it be rocks, plants, thunder, or flames, they are all composed of the same substance and operate under the same rules. Not only do chemical reactions follow these laws precisely, but so do the rising and setting of the sun and the blooming and wilting of flowers. The rules are so exact that as long as the initial conditions are the same, the outcome will always be identical. Chemistry is just a small part of it."



"...How is that possible?"



"I find it hard to imagine as well," he spread out the periodic table, "In intermediate chemistry, it defines the shape of the elements—a large sphere surrounded by numerous smaller spheres. The large sphere determines what element it is, and the number and arrangement of the smaller spheres in the outer layer determine the properties of the element. And this table is arranged according to this rule, as orderly as soldiers in a line. I have also completely understood His Highness's meaning: why we can deduce the properties and mechanisms of reaction of an element we have never seen or touched before. Because even the foundation of the reaction is the gain and loss of the small spheres, and it does not involve changes to the large sphere. This is also why elements do not disappear in reactions, but only transfer."



Chamis pondered for a moment, "Do you... believe it?"



Such theories were too ethereal and could not be verified by the eyes, so how did the author of the book come to know about them?



"I don't know, so I can't answer the question you asked earlier," Kyle smiled, "But whether we believe it or not is not important, the key is the perspective it provides, which is beyond anything I could have imagined... It has shown me another door, and inscribed upon that door is not only chemistry." His tone paused slightly, "Unfortunately, His Highness did not manage to record it all. Perhaps he does not understand what he has missed."



Chamis found these words hard to understand, just like when he first became an apprentice and faced the alchemist's terminology as if it were a foreign language. Now, he had that feeling again.



However, he was not worried, for as long as he followed his mentor, he would surely learn these so-called 'intrinsic connections of all things.' Compared to the chief alchemist, what he lacked the least was time.



After a moment of silence, Chamis asked, "But why are the books distributed by His Highness titled in different colored names?"



The Chief Alchemist let out a "huh," and said, "This... I seem to have overlooked it. Could it be an impulsive act?" But he quickly shook his head, "No, if it were black and red, it would be okay, these colors are particularly difficult to match, it's unlikely to be unintentional. Does that mean His Highness did this deliberately?"

"Elementary Chemistry" is blue, "Fundamentals of Natural Science" is blue, "Elementary Mathematics" is green, while the title of "Intermediate Chemistry (Incomplete)" is written in purple paint. When viewed separately, it's not prominent, but when placed together, they become particularly eye-catching.

"Probably for the sake of aesthetics?" Chames guessed.
