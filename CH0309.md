## Pursuit of Knowledge
The day after Mid-Autumn, Roland received a secret letter from the capital.

Nine times out of ten, the letters delivered by flying messengers were written by his personal guard, Theo.

Unfurling the strip of paper wrapped around the bird's claw, Roland walked to the window and began to read it closely in the bright sunlight.

"Your Highness, your plan has achieved astounding success."

"Since the palace was quickly sealed off and no one was allowed to enter or leave, I couldn't find out how effective the explosion was. However, by evening, almost every resident knew about the palace being attacked. Whether in taverns, inns, or in the squares, any place where people gathered, there was only one topic of conversation. Even the death of the former king did not have such a sensational impact. Coupled with the warning you had previously issued, now many people even believe that Timothy has perished in this attack, and you will soon reign over the capital, becoming the new ruler of Greycastle."

This information allowed Roland to completely relax—the bombing mission was successfully completed, and the witches returned safely; there was no better news than this.

After brewing himself a cup of tea, he returned to the mahogany desk to continue reading.

"However, according to the intelligence I've gathered so far, there has been no movement in the large noble territories outside the capital, and the palace's reaction was very swift, which leads me to speculate that Timothy Wimbledon is likely still alive."

"Additionally, there are people who swear that the attack came from the sky. Some residents witnessed pale objects descending from the heavens and plunging into the palace at great speed. Therefore, the task you entrusted to me, I already have a preliminary plan—if we can portray this incident as divine punishment you have inflicted on the false king for his tyranny, I think many people will believe it to be true."



"My subordinates are full of enthusiasm for this. They have already collected quite a number of Timothy's brutal deeds on a daily basis. Now mixed together, they should be even more effective. I believe that within a month, these messages will be passed to every citizen's ears through the rats of the underworld."

"Additionally, I will continue to closely monitor the movements of the barrack in the eastern suburbs. However, given the current situation, Timothy should be too preoccupied to think of countermeasures against attacks to attend to other matters."

The letter ended without a signature. After reading it, Roland carefully folded the secret letter and placed it in the drawer, letting out a long sigh of relief.

It would be great if Project East Wind could actually deter Timothy from deploying troops.

After all, it is such a waste to deplete a large number of people on drug-fueled warfare. The later the enemy starts attrition warfare, the more time I will have to win over the population.

Roland picked up his cup and took a sip of the fragrant, steaming tea. What he needed to do next was to wait patiently for the witches to return.

It had been several days since he had seen Anna, and no one had been stealing the dried fish from his drawer. He was starting to feel a little uneasy.

Just then, Carter pushed open the door to the office.

"Your Highness, two fleets have arrived at the dock."



"Is it the Margrave Consortium that has arrived? Taking into account the time spent on the road, she actually missed quite a show... wait," Roland paused slightly, "there's another fleet?"



"Yes," Carter said with a smile, "the envoy group you dispatched to the Southern Territory to recruit people has returned with a group. The refugees they brought back nearly filled the dock. The City Hall is implementing the plan you devised, together with Miss Lily, to carry out that..."



"Quarantine work."



"Exactly, to prevent any potential demonic plague..." The Chief Knight coughed twice, "This batch of people is about four to five hundred in number."



"Is that so?" Roland couldn't help but curl the corners of his mouth. He had just been talking about this, and now there was already a result. It seemed that the temporary housing that Lotus was in charge of would need to be increased again, "Let's go take a look."



...

Kyle Sichi put down the thin scroll, repeating a phrase to himself, "So that's how it is."



"Teacher?" Chemist asked somewhat worriedly.



Ever since he had gotten hold of this "Intermediate Chemistry," Kyle had been without sleep for two days straight, poring over the entire ancient book without rest. He had glanced at it a few times, but the content was too profound and utterly beyond his comprehension.



"I'm fine." The voice of the Chief Alchemist had no trace of tiredness. Instead, it was full of vigor. Though there were rheum in the corners of his eyes, his gaze was sharp and bright, not at all like someone who had been up all night.



It was a rule that disciples must not lightly disturb their teacher while they were engrossed in alchemical research. Only now did Chames dare to speak up and seek guidance. "This book... I don't understand it. What are atoms? And what are electrons?"



"You are already a qualified alchemist, so you should no longer refer to yourself as a disciple. According to His Highness, we are now colleagues," Kyle paused for a moment, "As for your question, I don't know how to answer it... In fact, when Prince Roland gave me 'Intermediate Chemistry,' he also included this book."



Chames looked at another book lying on the table; its cover read 'The Basics of Natural Science.'



"Mr. Steuer..." he started, somewhat uncomfortable with the address, "it seems to have nothing to do with alchemy... no, chemistry."



"I thought the same initially," Kyle stroked his beard and reflected, "But after flipping through a few pages, I realized that I actually knew nothing about this world."



"What?" Chames was taken aback. Knew nothing? Alchemists researched the composition of matter, the nature of elements. If even they knew nothing, what difference was there between other people and monkeys?



"I'm referring to our concepts," the Chief Alchemist said with excitement... and satisfaction in his voice, "We thought alchemy was just alchemy, a study of matter. The rising and setting of the sun, the blooming and withering of flowers, all seemed unrelated to us."



"Isn't that the case... Observing the sun and stars is the domain of astrologers, and as for plants," Chames spoke with a hint of disdain, "that's something for farmers and herbalists to study."



"So we know nothing," Kyle shook his head, "This book attempts to link everything together from the very beginning. Whether it's stones, plants, thunder, or flames, they are all composed of the same entity and operate under the same rules. Not only do chemical reactions follow these rules precisely, but so do the rising and setting of the sun and the blooming and withering of flowers. This rule is so exact that as long as the initial conditions are the same, the outcome will be identical. Chemistry is just a small part of it."



"...How is that possible?"



"I find it hard to imagine as well," he spread out the periodic table, "In intermediate chemistry, it defines the shape of elements—a large sphere surrounded by numerous smaller spheres. The large sphere determines what element it is, and the layers and number of outer spheres determine the properties of the element. This table is arranged according to this rule, as orderly as soldiers in a line. I now fully understand His Highness's point: why we can deduce the properties and reaction mechanisms of elements we have never seen or touched before. Because even the fundamentals of reactions are about the gaining and losing of these small spheres, without any changes to the large sphere. This is also why elements do not disappear in reactions, they only transfer."



Chambers pondered for a moment, "Do you... believe it?"



These theories were too ethereal and couldn't be verified with eyes. So, how did the person who wrote this book know about them?



"I don't know, so I can't answer the question you asked earlier," Kyle smiled, "But whether we believe it or not is not important. The key point is the perspective it provides, which I have never imagined... It has shown me another door, and inscribed on that door is not only chemistry." At this point, his tone paused slightly, "Unfortunately, His Highness wasn't able to record it all. Perhaps he can't understand what exactly he has missed."



Chambers felt somewhat confused by these words, just like when he first became an apprentice and faced the alchemist's terminology as if it were a foreign language. Now, he felt that way again.



However, he wasn't worried. As long as he followed his mentor, he would certainly learn these so-called 'intrinsic connections of all things'. Compared to the Chief Alchemist, what he had most was time.



After a moment of silence, Chambers spoke, "But why do the books distributed by His Highness have names in different colors?"



Chief Alchemist "eh" made a sound, "This... I actually overlooked this. Could it be a whimsical act?" But he quickly shook his head and said, "No, if it were black and red it would be fine, these few colors are particularly difficult to match, it's unlikely to be unintentional. Does that mean His Highness did this on purpose?"



"Elementary Chemistry" is blue, "Theoretical Basis of Natural Science" is blue, "Elementary Mathematics" is green, while the title of "Intermediate Chemistry (Incomplete Volume)" is written in purple pigment. They do not stand out when viewed separately, but when placed together, they are particularly eye-catching.



"Probably for aesthetic reasons?" Chames guessed.
