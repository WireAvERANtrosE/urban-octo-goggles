## High-pressure gas cylinder
After the meeting ended, Roland kept Barov behind for a private talk.



"As you have seen, the chemical laboratory needs people, the Greycastle Industrial Company needs people, and I am planning to mass-produce soap and perfume soon, which also require a lot of manpower," the prince said straightforwardly. "Even after most of the town residents pass the primary education assessment, it won't be until next year, and even then, we will only have six to seven hundred people at most, which is not enough. I need more population."



"If we were to conscript from the stronghold..."



"No," Roland interrupted, "After the city is built next year, the stronghold will merge with the town into one entity. That would be like moving money from the left pocket to the right pocket. I need more people from outside the Western Region."



"That's..." Barov seemed troubled, "I'm afraid that won't be so easy to resolve. If we were to poach people from other cities, the local lords wouldn't just stand by and watch."



"We won't go to the cities," Roland dipped his finger into his cup and picked up some ice water, tracing patterns on the table, "Have you noticed that since the end of the Evil Months, Greycastle has been in constant turmoil. Including Timothy's several attacks on the Southern Territory, leading to the burning of Eagle City, and the surrounding villages and small towns suffering severe damage. Then there was the campaign in the Northern Territory, where Duke Ryan was stripped of his title and lands for treason. And finally, there was the recent naval attack on the east," he tapped the table forcefully, leaving a puddle of water, "which has affected Seawindshire, Valencia, and Crows Town, not to mention the other smaller towns around them. The number of refugees fleeing to King's City alone shows how devastating the losses were."



"You mean..." Barov wore a thoughtful expression.



"Spread the word about the Western Region," the prince smoothed out the water, "In the past six months, only the Western Region has been at peace, with no forced conscription or war invasions. Especially the first point—Timothy has been using civilians extensively in warfare, which will definitely lead to conscription and even plundering of civilians elsewhere. Nobody can guarantee it won't happen to them next, so a land free from the flames of war is our key point for propaganda."



"I think I understand," he pondered, "You plan to attract civilians from other towns and villages by offering promises of no forced conscription, no forced labor, while providing housing, food, and stable work, right?"



"Almost," Roland nodded with a smile, his mind agile and receptive—a trait that has always been an advantage for ministerial assistants, "and we must also emphasize the generous treatment that literate people can enjoy. I think there will certainly be some desperate knights and nobles in these places willing to come to the Western Region to try their luck."



Whether it's a village or a town, it's almost always the territory of minor nobles. If it's a time of peace, even if the land is barren and poorly managed, they can always fill their stomachs by guarding a few acres of land. But during times of turmoil, if there is severe population loss, life becomes unsustainable. At such times, having a stable place to go to would appeal to most people. After all, their territories wouldn't be taken by others even if left unattended, and they could just return with money and mercenaries to take back control after weathering the storm.



As for how to promote this, he believed the other party would have their own methods.



"But Your Highness, in doing so, settling these people will be another expense, and we cannot interrupt the purchase of food from the outside," Barov hesitated, "If something unexpected happens to the caravan, the treasury of the City Hall will soon run dry."



"Hmm... You have a point," Roland stroked his chin, the most important task of the nascent political force being to establish prestige and confidence in the hearts of the people. If they suddenly fell into a situation where they couldn't pay salaries, the favorable situation would take a sharp downturn, "Alright, you go back and prepare a plan. We'll implement it after the caravan completes the next month's trade with the town, when the treasury is replenished."



"By your command, Your Highness." Barov said, placing his hand on his chest.



After giving the instructions, Roland returned to his office and began to ponder how to fulfill Margaret's balloon order.



The price of a thousand Gold royals was even higher than that of a steam engine, but its cost was much lower. The balloon envelope mainly relied on Soraya's drawings, while hemp ropes and bamboo baskets were cheap. In fact, Roland had already produced a simple prototype in the courtyard of the arsenal: a hydrogen balloon that could carry both Lightning and Maggie into the sky.



After much consideration, he ultimately abandoned the hot air balloon idea—town gas needed to be obtained by dry distilling coal, which required large equipment and was very troublesome to produce. Plus, coal had to be imported from other towns, making small-scale production very uneconomical, far less convenient and readily available than hydrogen.



The prototype was made with a single-sided water coating. After painting, the paper on the back was burned away, making the entire balloon so light it was almost weightless, with exceptional flexibility. In tests, the inflated balloon was not afraid of rain, impact, or fire. Maggie transformed into various birds and pecked at it fiercely, yet not a single mark was left. Only an iron needle could barely penetrate this one-millimeter-thick coating. Due to its extremely light weight, a hydrogen balloon with a diameter of about five meters could carry an adult into the sky.



The only difficulty lay in how to solve the inflation problem with high-pressure hydrogen cylinders.



The direct current motor used for electrolyzing water to produce hydrogen was absolutely not for sale. A single motor connected to a steam engine could inflate all the hydrogen balloons, which was clearly uneconomical. If one wanted to continuously earn Gold royals from the big dog traders, there had to be high-pressure cylinders available for repeated inflation.



The cylinders themselves were not difficult to make; if the material was inadequate, the wall thickness could be compensated for, and both pig iron and refined iron were suitable. With Anna around, precision machining was not an issue. The key was the inflation process—modern gas cylinders have a pressure of over 20 MPa, and it was undoubtedly a fantasy to rely on air pumps to achieve that pressure. Not even ten Qilin Arms would suffice; at the very least, a high-pressure air pump was needed. Without enough pressure in the cylinder, the hydrogen balloon could not be filled properly.



High-pressure air pumps are divided into piston compression and turbine compression. The former belongs to the internal combustion engine technology tree, while the latter falls under the category of turbine technology. Developing either type would be a time-consuming and labor-intensive major project. Finally, by evening, Roland came up with the simplest solution: self-inflating the cylinder.



The inspiration came from a news story he had seen before crossing over: a street vendor selling hydrogen balloons used a modified liquefied gas tank to store hydrogen, which resulted in an explosion and tragedy. The reason was that the vendor directly used dilute sulfuric acid and aluminum to produce hydrogen in the cylinder, without calculating the reaction quantity, leading to excessive internal pressure and bursting the tank.



The self-inflation method involved pouring dilute sulfuric acid and active metal into the cylinder to displace the hydrogen. The laboratory commonly used zinc, and aluminum produces the most hydrogen by weight, but neither was available in this era, so Roland still planned to use iron for the reaction—Lucia could separate extremely pure elemental iron, and the slow reaction speed at room temperature could be improved by heating and increasing the contact area (such as with iron sheets or iron powder), with an internal coating to resist the acid's corrosion on the cylinder.



With this in mind, he immediately drew a simple sketch on paper—for the purpose of reducing leaks, the high-pressure cylinder should be as integral as possible, so the body of the cylinder was seamless, leaving only a raised threaded hole at the top that could be screwed into a nozzle with a valve.



After injecting the reactants through the hole and tightening the nozzle, the continuously generated gases had nowhere to go, and the internal pressure of the cylinder could reach a very considerable value. When used, simply unscrew the valve, and the hydrogen would surge out, rushing into the balloon. Recharging was also convenient; remove the nozzle, dry the moisture, clean out the ferrous sulfate crystals inside, and it was ready to be refilled with reactants.



Considering that sulfuric acid is also an alchemical product, the inflation price obviously can't be set too low.

Let's set it at fifty gold royals per refill, with one free refill for every ten purchased, Roland thought.
