## High-pressure gas cylinder
After the meeting ended, Roland kept Barov behind for a private discussion.



"You've seen it yourself, the chemical laboratory needs people, the Greycastle Industrial Company needs people, and I plan to mass-produce soap and perfume soon, which will also require a lot of manpower," the prince said straightforwardly. "Even after most of the townsfolk pass the primary education assessment, it won't be until next year, and even then, we're only talking about six or seven hundred people at best. That's not enough. I need more population."



"If we call people from the fortress..."



"No," Roland interrupted, "after the city is built next year, the fortress will be integrated with the town. That would be like taking money out of the left pocket and putting it into the right pocket. I need more people from outside the Western Territory."



"This..." Barov replied with some difficulty, "I'm afraid that won't be so easy to resolve. If we try to take people from other cities, the local lords won't stand by and do nothing."



"We won't go to the cities," Roland said, dipping his finger into a cup of ice water and drawing on the table, "Have you noticed that since the end of the Evil Months, Greycastle has been in constant turmoil. Including Timothy's multiple attacks on the Southern Territory, leading to the burning of Eagle City and severe damage to the surrounding villages and towns. Then there was the campaign in the Northern Territory, where Duke Ryan was stripped of his title and lands for treason. And most recently, the maritime assault on the East," he knocked on the table forcefully, leaving a puddle of water, "which greatly affected Sea Wind Shire, Golden Wheat City, and Coldwind Castle, not to mention the smaller towns around them. The number of people fleeing to the capital alone shows how severe the losses have been."



"You mean..." Barov's expression showed he was catching on.



"Spread the word about the Western Territory," the prince wiped the water flat, "In the past six months, only the Western Territory has been at peace, without forced conscription or war ravages. Especially the first point—Timothy's extensive use of civilians in warfare will definitely lead to conscription, or even kidnapping, all over the place—and nobody can guarantee it won't happen to them next. Therefore, a land of safety isolated from war will be our selling point."



"I think I understand," he pondered, "You plan to attract people from other towns and villages by promising not to force them into conscription or labor, while also providing housing, food, and stable work, right?"



"About right," Roland nodded with a smile, his quick thinking and strong reception skills had always been the strengths of a minister's assistant, "And we need to emphasize the generous treatment that literate people can enjoy. I believe there will be some desperate knights and nobles in those areas willing to try their luck in the Western Region."



Whether it's a village or a town, they are almost always the territories of minor nobles. During peaceful times, even if the land is infertile and poorly managed, guarding a few acres of land is enough to feed oneself. But during turbulent times when there is a severe loss of population, life becomes unsustainable. At such times, having a stable place to go would appeal to most people. After all, even if no one is looking after their territory, it won't be taken by others. They can just wait out this period, then return with money and mercenaries to take back their land.



As for how to advertise, he believed the other party would have a way.



"But Your Highness, this way, settling these people is another expense, and we cannot stop buying food from the outside," Barov hesitated, "If something unexpected happens to the caravan, the town hall's treasury will quickly run dry."



"Hmm... You make a good point," Roland stroked his chin, the most important task for a nascent political force was to establish credibility and confidence in the hearts of the people. If they suddenly fell into a situation where they couldn't pay salaries, the great situation would take a sharp turn for the worse, "In that case, go back and prepare a plan. Once the caravan has completed the trade with the town next month and the treasury is replenished, we will implement it."



"As you command, Your Highness." Barov bowed his chest.



After giving his instructions, Roland returned to his office and began to ponder how to fulfill Margaret's balloon order.



A thousand Gold royals per unit was more expensive than a steam engine, but its cost was much cheaper. The balloon mainly depended on Soraya's painting, and the hemp ropes and bamboo baskets were inexpensive. In fact, Roland had already created a simple prototype in the military factory's yard: a hydrogen balloon that could carry Lightning and Maggie up into the sky.



After much consideration, he ultimately abandoned the hot air balloon idea—the gas required dry distillation of coal, which needed large equipment and was quite troublesome to make. Plus, the coal had to be imported from other towns. Small-scale production was not cost-effective, nowhere near as convenient and readily available as hydrogen.



The prototype used a single-sided water coating, and after the painting was done, the paper on the back was burned away. As a result, the entire balloon was so light it was almost weightless, and its flexibility was also outstanding. In the tests, the inflated balloon was not afraid of rain, collision, or fire. Maggie transformed into various birds and pecked at it fiercely, but not a single mark was left. Only an iron needle could barely penetrate this one-millimeter-thick coating. Due to its extremely light weight, a hydrogen balloon with a diameter of about five meters could carry an adult into the sky.



The only difficulty was how to solve the problem of inflating with high-pressure hydrogen cylinders.

The direct current motor used for electrolyzing water to produce hydrogen was absolutely not for sale. One motor connected to a steam engine could inflate all the hydrogen balloons, which was obviously too uneconomical. If one wanted to continuously earn Gold royals from the hands of the dog owners, there had to be high-pressure cylinders available for repeated inflation.



The cylinder itself was not difficult to produce; if the material was not adequate, the wall thickness could be increased, and both pig iron and wrought iron could be used. With Anna around, precision machining was not a problem. The key was in the inflation—modern gas cylinders have pressures over 20MPa, and it would be a fantasy to think of pumping air into them with a hand pump. Not even ten pairs of Qilin Arms would be enough; at the very least, a high-pressure gas pump was required. However, if the pressure inside the bottle was not sufficient, it would be impossible to fully inflate the hydrogen balloon.



There were two types of high-pressure gas pumps: piston compression and turbine compression. The former belonged to the internal combustion engine technology tree, while the latter fell within the category of turbine machinery. Developing either type would be a time-consuming and labor-intensive major project. It was not until evening that Roland finally came up with the simplest solution: self-inflation within the bottle.



The inspiration for this came from a news story he had seen before crossing over: a street vendor using a modified liquefied gas tank to store hydrogen gas had caused a tragic explosion. The reason was that the vendor had directly produced hydrogen in the bottle using dilute sulfuric acid and aluminum, without calculating the amount of reaction, resulting in excessive pressure inside the tank and the tank bursting.



The method of self-inflation was to pour dilute sulfuric acid and active metal into the bottle, displacing the hydrogen gas. The laboratory commonly used zinc, and the metal that produced the most hydrogen by equal weight was aluminum, but neither was available in this era. Therefore, Roland still planned to use iron for the reaction—Lucia could separate iron with extremely high purity, and the problem of a slow reaction speed at room temperature could be improved by heating and increasing the contact area (such as with iron sheets or iron powder), and a coating on the inside could protect the bottle from acid corrosion.



Thinking of this, he immediately drew a simple sketch on paper—to reduce gas leakage, the high-pressure cylinder should be as integral as possible, so the body of the bottle was one piece, with only a raised threaded hole at the top, into which a valved nozzle could be screwed.



After the reactants were poured in through the hole and the nozzle was tightened, the continuously generated gas had nowhere to go, and the pressure inside the bottle could reach a very impressive value. When in use, simply unscrew the valve, and the hydrogen gas would surge out, rushing into the balloon. Refilling was also convenient; remove the nozzle, dry the moisture, clear out the iron sulfate crystals inside, and it was ready to be filled with reactants again.



Considering that sulfuric acid is also an alchemical product, the price for inflation obviously cannot be set too low.

Let's set it at fifty Gold Royals per refill, and offer one free refill for every ten purchased, Roland thought.
