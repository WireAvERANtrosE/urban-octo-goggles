## Long-awaited victory!
Fjords, Sea Dragon Bay.

The believers of the church climbed onto the walls and shot crossbow bolts at the witches, but they proved ineffective against Sylvie's invisible barrier and Molly's magical servants. Either the arrows would fall out of the air or be swallowed by the servants. Only when the enemy shot bolts tipped with the Divine Stone of Judgement did they pose a threat.



The number of Divine Stones of Judgement was ultimately limited, and any witch unlucky enough to be hit was immediately dragged back for treatment. As long as the bleeding was stopped in time, their lives were not in danger. After two or three volleys, more than twenty witches had advanced to the edge of the wall. Ashes leaped directly onto the top of the wall, dealing with any believers who dared to show their heads.



After several days of pre-war reconnaissance, they knew the weaknesses of this wall like the back of their hand. The cooing of pigeons, varying in length, filled the sky—Maggie was signaling that they had reached the correct position.



With the experience of previous battles, Lotus did not hesitate to use her power, and the ground suddenly began to shake. The church believers tried to rush over to stop her, but Ashes killed each one of them. The wall, unprotected by the Divine Stone of Judgement, quickly collapsed, and the witches rushed in, unleashing their powers on the believers. Those not wearing the Divine Stone of Judgement fell by the half, while those still standing were cleanly reaped by Ashes.



This was the first time the church had faced a direct attack since its construction, and the enemy was the church's arch-nemesis. The priests stationed here also knew it was the final moment, and he called on the remaining believers to take pills and sacrifice themselves for the deity. Over a dozen frenzied believers entangled Ashes with their flesh and blood, while the rest rushed towards Lotus and the others.



Prepared for this, Lotus raised a wall of earth from the ground, temporarily blocking the enemy. The Divine Stone of Judgement could not eliminate the effects of magic that had already been completed, and when they circumvented the wall, they found nothing behind it.



The frenzied believers had no choice but to return to besiege Ashes, but that group of witches would suddenly appear behind and strike down the unsuspecting enemies. With each repetition, the enemy suffered losses, and after half an hour of fierce fighting, the church was filled with the bodies of believers, leaving only the priest.



Trembling, he brought the pill to his lips, but before he could swallow it, Ashes stepped forward and cut off his arm with a sword.



"You damned evil doer! Monster cursed by the devil!" He clutched his severed hand, howling hysterically, his eyes filled with fear.

"Scared? When you tortured and slaughtered those innocents, did you ever think about their feelings?" Ashes said coldly. "Compared to witches, you are more like the devil's minions, scumbags capable of all evils. So, go to hell with peace of mind." With those words, her great sword fell, cutting off his curse in his throat.

"Did we win?" Molly approached her, her tone still somewhat incredulous.

"Yes," Ashes let out a breath, "This is the last church in the Fjords, from now on, there will no longer be any church strongholds on the islands, we have won!"

Although the Church's power in the Fjords was very weak, each church having no more than a hundred followers and no stationed Judgement Army, this was the first time the witches had directly confronted and won against the Church. From being chased around and trembling at the slightest hint of danger to now seizing churches and bringing down the once formidable giant, even a negligible part of the Church was enough to exhilarate the witches.

Just as she had anticipated, once everyone confirmed this long-awaited victory, they couldn't help but cheer loudly. The Church was like a mountain weighing on everyone's hearts, and now, they had finally pried the foot of the mountain, letting a ray of dawn light through. From now on, the Fjords would become their true homeland.

"We won!"

"Long live Lady Tilly!"

"Goo goo!"



Upon returning to Sleeping Island by ship, Ashes couldn't wait to rush back to Tilly's residence to inform her of the witches' complete victory. Tilly tucked her gray hair behind her ear, revealing a radiant smile: "Maggie has already told me, I heard that all of you are safe and sound, which is truly wonderful."



Indeed, compared to a sailing ship, her speed as a seagull was much faster. Ashes looked around, but didn't see the familiar figure, "Where's Maggie?"



"She left, right after reporting the victory," Tilly said, shaking her head helplessly.



Ashes paused, "She... went back to the Western Region?"



"Yes," Tilly said with a light smile, "Perhaps she has made some very good friends there, she couldn't wait to return just after a few days. If it weren't for assisting us in defeating the church, I'm afraid she would have flown back to Border Town the day she delivered the letter... I'm becoming more and more curious about that place."



Ashes hesitated before speaking, "Should I not have left her there?"



"No, it's fine," the fifth princess responded confidently, "It's precisely because you let Maggie stay in Border Town that we were able to easily make contact with the other side. I also had her take my reply to Roland Wimbledon's letter."



She made a face, "Guess how I responded to him?"



"Of course, it's a refusal. Crossing the sea is full of risks; how could we possibly send witches to the Western Region again?"



"No, I agreed to his request," Tilly said with a lift of her lips, "I also briefly introduced the abilities of the non-combat witches to him, and wrote in the letter that as long as he can guarantee the safety of the witches, I would consider allowing some witches to go to Border Town—how did he put it? Ah, yes—to 'inspect and study, to enhance friendship, and to progress hand in hand.' I might even personally visit the town if necessary."



"Your Highness!" Ashes couldn't help but blurt out the title she used to use when she was a royal guard.



"I know what you're worried about, but at the moment, the church is the biggest enemy of the witches, and having one more ally is to have more strength. Dealing with the Fjords is a matter of interest, while the Mutual Aid Society of Border Town is naturally our friend. Since they are friends, why not show a little more goodwill?" Tilly said with a smile, "Besides, Maggie mentioned that witches could evolve their abilities by learning new knowledge. Aren't you curious? If the witches we send could learn this technique, Sleeping Island will benefit immensely."



"But if you personally go there, what if the other party..."



Tilly raised a hand to stop Ashes, "Don't worry, I'm not saying we leave immediately. I won't venture into danger before the situation is clear. Don't forget, Sylvie can see through any disguise, whether it's sophisticated makeup or magical illusions, nothing can escape her eyes. As long as she accompanies the first group to the town, she can help reveal the truth about the Fourth Prince. Besides, even if we encounter danger, aren't you by my side?"



Ashes locked eyes with her for a long while before finally nodding.



"Of course, we can discuss the specifics when Maggie returns next month," Tilly said with a smile, "Right now, we have something more important to take care of."



"What?" Ashes asked in surprise. Now that the church's influence in the Fjords had been eradicated, it seemed that all they needed to do was to focus on building Sleeping Island... but Tilly's expression suggested otherwise.



The fifth princess pointed at the red gemstone on her white silk glove, "Not only on the Kingdom Mainland, but there's also an ancient ruin on the Shadow Islands of the Fjords, and most of the magic stones we've bought from the islanders come from that ruin. Taking advantage of the church's downfall, I want to personally take a look."



"Is it the legendary Ghost Shadow Red River?" Ashes had heard some of the tales after spending time in the fjords. This relic appeared and disappeared unpredictably in the sea, surrounded by dangerous currents and sea beasts, making it inaccessible to ordinary people. Moreover, since its first discovery, many explorers had met their demise in the Shadow Islands while attempting to witness this incredible spectacle. "But you don't know its exact location, how do you plan to enter the ruins?"



"Indeed, I do not know its location, but I do know someone who can lead us there—in fact, this distinguished explorer is on Sleeping Island, and he was the one who first discovered the ruins," Tilly said with a smile.
