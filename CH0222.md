## The long-awaited victory!
Fjords, Sea Dragon Ridge.



The believers of the Church climbed onto the walls and shot crossbow bolts at the witches, but to little effect against Sylvie's invisible barrier and Molly's magic servitors. The bolts either fell to the ground out of thin air or were swallowed by the servitors. Only when the enemies fired god's punishment arrows with embedded God's Stone of Retaliation did they pose a threat.



However, the number of God's Stone of Retaliation was ultimately limited. Witches unlucky enough to be hit were immediately dragged to the back for treatment, and as long as the bleeding was stopped in time, their lives were not in danger. After two or three rounds of shooting, more than twenty witches had advanced to the edge of the wall. Ashes leapt directly onto the top of the wall, clearing out those believers who dared to show their heads.



After several days of pre-battle reconnaissance, they knew the weaknesses of this wall like the back of their hands. The cooing of pigeons, long and short, came from the sky—Maggie was signaling that they had reached the correct position.



Lotus, with her previous combat experience, did not hesitate to use her ability, and the ground shook dramatically. The believers of the Church wanted to rush over to stop them, but they were all killed one by one by Ashes. The wall, unprotected by the God's Stone of Retaliation, quickly collapsed, and the witches rushed in, each unleashing their powers on the believers. Those not wearing the God's Stone of Retaliation fell in an instant, and those still standing were neatly reaped by Ashes.



This was the first time the church had faced a direct attack since it was built, and the enemy was the Church's arch-nemesis. The priests stationed there also knew that the final moment had come. He called upon the remaining believers to take the pills and sacrifice themselves for the deity. More than a dozen frenzied believers entangled Ashes with their flesh and blood, while the rest pounced towards Lotus and the others.



Lotus, well-prepared, raised a wall of earth from the ground to temporarily block the enemy. The God's Stone of Retaliation could not nullify the effects of magic that had already been completed. When they bypassed the earth wall, they found nothing behind it.



The frenzied believers had no choice but to return to besiege Ashes, yet the group of witches would suddenly appear behind them, knocking down the unprepared enemies. With each repetition, the opponents suffered losses. After half an hour of fierce fighting, the church was filled with the bodies of believers, leaving only the priest.



Trembling, he brought the pill to his mouth, but before he could swallow it, he had his arm severed by a sword from Ashes, who had stepped forward.



"You despicable evildoer! A monster cursed by the devil!" He hugged his severed hand, hysterically howling, his eyes filled with fear.

"Are you scared? When you tortured and slaughtered those innocents, did you ever consider their feelings?" Ashes said coldly, "Compared to witches, you are more like the devil's henchmen, scum that commits all kinds of evil. So, go to hell with peace in your mind." With that, her greatsword fell, cutting off his curse in his throat.

"Did we win?" Molly walked up to her, still somewhat incredulous in her tone.

"Yes," Ashes let out a breath, "This is the last church in the Fjords, and from now on, there will be no more church strongholds on the islands. We have won!"

Although the church's power in the Fjords was very weak, with only a hundred or so believers in each church and no stationed Judgement Army, this was the first time the witches had directly confronted and triumphed over the church. From being driven around and living in fear at the slightest hint of danger to now capturing churches and bringing down the once colossal entity, even if it was just an insignificant part of the church, it was enough to greatly uplift the witches.

Just as she had anticipated, once everyone confirmed this long-awaited victory, they couldn't help but cheer loudly. The church was like a mountain weighing on everyone's hearts, and now, they had finally leveraged the base of the mountain, allowing a glimmer of dawn to shine through. From now on, the Fjords would become their true homeland.

"We won!"

"Long live Lady Tilly!"

"Goo Goo!"



Returning to Sleeping Island by boat, Ashes couldn't wait to rush back to Tilly's residence to tell her the news of the witches' complete victory. The latter pushed her gray hair behind her ears, revealing a radiant smile: "Maggie has already told me, I heard that all of you are safe and sound, which is really great."



Indeed, compared to a sailboat, her speed flying as a seabird was much faster. Ashes looked around and didn't see the familiar figure, "Where's Maggie?"



"She left, right after reporting the victory," Tilly said, shaking her head helplessly.



Ashes paused, "She... went back to the Western Region?"



"Yes," Tilly said with a light smile, "She probably made some close friends there, so eager that she couldn't wait to return after just a few days. If it weren't for helping us defeat the Church, I'm afraid she would have flown back to Border Town the same day she delivered the letter... I'm getting more and more curious about that place."



Ashes hesitated before speaking, "Should I not have left her there?"



"No, it's good," the fifth princess replied with a firm tone, "It's precisely because you let Maggie stay in Border Town that we were able to easily maintain contact with the other side. I also sent my reply to Roland Wimbledon with her." She made a funny face, "Guess how I responded to him?"



"Of course, a refusal. Crossing the sea is full of risks; how could we possibly send witches to the Western Region again?"



"No, I agreed to his request," Tilly said with a lifted corner of her mouth, "I even briefly introduced the abilities of the non-combat witches to him, and mentioned in the letter that as long as he can ensure the safety of the witches, I would consider sending some to Border Town—how did he put it? Right— for observation and study, to enhance friendship, and to make progress together." She paused for a moment, "If necessary, I could even make the trip to the town myself."



"Your Highness!" Ashes couldn't help but cry out with the honorific she used when she had been a royal guard.



"I know what you're worried about, but right now the witches' greatest enemy is the Church, and an extra ally means extra strength. Dealing with the Fjords is a matter of interest, while the Mutual Aid Society of Border Town is a natural friend. Since they are friends, why not show a little more goodwill?" Tilly said with a smile. "Besides, Maggie told me that witches can evolve their abilities by learning new knowledge. Aren't you curious about that? If the witches we send can also learn this skill, Sleeping Island will benefit greatly."



"But if you personally go, what if the other party..."



Tilly raised her hand to interrupt Ashes, "Don't worry, I didn't say I would leave immediately. I won't venture into danger before the situation is clear. Don't forget, Sylvie can see through any disguise, whether it's elaborate makeup or magical illusions, nothing can escape her eyes. Just by accompanying the first group to the town, she can help me uncover the truth about the fourth prince. Besides, even if there is danger, won't you be by my side?"



Ashes looked at her for a long time and finally nodded.



"Of course, we can discuss the specifics when Maggie returns next month," Tilly said with a smile, "Right now, we have something even more important to do."



"What?" Ashes asked, somewhat surprised. Now that the Church's power in the Fjords had been wiped out, it seemed that all that was left was to peacefully develop Sleeping Island... but Tilly's expression suggested otherwise.



The fifth princess pointed to the red gemstone on her white silk gloves, "Not only on the Kingdom's mainland but also on the Shadow Islands in the Fjords, there is an ancient relic, and most of the magic stones purchased from the islanders come from that relic. With the Church in disarray, I want to go and see it for myself."



"Is it the Ghost Shadow Redwater from the folk legend?" Ashes had stayed in the fjord for a while and had also heard a bit about these tales. This ruin would appear and disappear intermittently in the vast sea and was surrounded by perilous undercurrents and sea beasts; ordinary people couldn't reach it at all. Moreover, since its first discovery, many explorers, in their desire to witness this inconceivable marvel, had unfortunately met their end in the Shadow Islands. "If you don't know its exact location, how can we enter the ruins?"



"Indeed, I don't know its position, but I do know someone who can lead us there—in fact, this distinguished explorer is on Sleeping Island, and he was the very first to discover these ruins," Tilly said with a smile.
