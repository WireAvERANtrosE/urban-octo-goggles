## Envoy (Part 1)
"This place, still as dilapidated as ever." When Ambassador Petro stepped out of the cabin, a whiff of rotting wood hit him in the face. The air around him was damp and oppressive, making his whole body uncomfortable. He sniffed, looked up, and saw the sky was a gloomy grey, as if a downpour was brewing.



"You last came here a year ago, right?" his assistant said attentively, draping a woolen coat over the ambassador, "There's nothing here but rocks."



"It was a year and a half ago," Petro corrected, "His Grace rotates different people here each season. It was summer when I last visited Border Town. And besides rocks, there are also all kinds of fine furs, and..."



"What?" The assistant looked puzzled.



Petro shook his head without answering. He stepped over the ship's rail and onto the moss-covered dock, the wooden planks creaking under his feet. Probably in a few more years, this dock would fall apart, he thought. Border Town had not only rocks and furs but also... land. But there was no point in saying this; the assistant was just an obscure clerk from the town hall, unable to see the potential.



There was a vast expanse of untapped land between Border Town and Longsong Stronghold, bordered on one side by the Impassable Mountain Range and on the other by the Redwater River, like a narrow corridor. As an outpost of the stronghold, if it took on the responsibility of the defense line, the vast lands in between would all be brought under the stronghold's control. They were uncultivated, requiring no fallow period before planting, and with natural barriers on both sides, they could be easily taken without much effort. This would help alleviate a series of problems caused by the increasing population of the stronghold, and Border Town would become part of the stronghold, rather than being a separate territory as it is now.



The only downside was that it would require three to five years of management, as well as a sizable initial investment.



Unfortunately, when it came to the foresight of investing, most nobles were worse than a mediocre merchant.



"Eh, why is the yard empty?" the assistant pointed to a vacant area in the distance, "Shouldn't they have prepared the ore?"



Petro sighed softly, "Let's go to the castle and meet His Highness."



"Wait... Mr. Ambassador, aren't you waiting for their reception team?"



He didn't know if there was one, but he kept the thought to himself, "Let's go, the stables are up ahead."



Now, the trouble of being divided into two separate territories was apparent. The king's decree had thrown the Fourth Prince into this remote land. What would a normal noble or royal scion do? Naturally, they would claim everything here for themselves. Exchange ore and gems for grain and bread? The prince's eyes probably only saw Gold royals.



If it were him, he would do the same. Watching one's own territory's output being exchanged for such a low price was something no one would willingly accept. Moreover, the prince didn't necessarily have to go to the stronghold. The family seemed to have forgotten a fact - the Redwater River did not only pass through Longsong Stronghold. He could sell the ore at market price to Willow Town, to Fallen Dragon Ridge, to Redwater City, and then take his people to these places for refuge—it was just a longer journey.



Then what could Longsong Stronghold do? Block the river and intercept the prince's party? That would be an outright confrontation with the Greycastle royal family! Everyone knew that the Fourth Prince was not favored by the king, but he was still of the king's bloodline, without a doubt.



The two men rode on rented horses, slowly proceeding along the riverside cobblestone path. The horses from the stables were old, with mixed coats and bony bodies, trembling all over even at a slow pace. And for these two poor creatures, he had to pay two Gold royals as a deposit.



"Look, sir, is that a boat from Willow Town?"

Hearing his assistant's shout, he looked in the direction pointed out, only to see a single-masted sailboat with a flag of green leaves and a curved saber slowly sailing along the river. The waterline on the hull was high, indicating it was loaded with cargo.

Petro nodded expressionlessly, but his heart sank. The other party was moving faster than expected. If the prince had already started contacting the towns downstream of the Redwater River, he would have one less bargaining chip. He had originally planned to persuade his father to agree to purchase ores at a price thirty percent below the normal rate, which would still be profitable, not to mention that the value of jewels could increase several times over after being processed. Unfortunately, this monopoly was not decided by him or the Silverflower family alone. There were six noble families involved in the Border Town mining industry, and without the majority's agreement, no resolution could be formed.



But they were slow to react, thinking the situation was the same as before... or perhaps, the output from the mining area was not worth their attention. Regardless, the other five families remained indifferent, and his father confidently rejected him. They were making a big mistake; the main reason for the low output was this barter system. If it were normal trade, the more they produced, the more they earned, and it was very likely that the ore production could reach a new level by next year.



If they stick to the previous monopoly plan, it was almost certainly impossible now. Petro thought, as could be seen from the empty dockyards, the prince had no intention of exchanging these stones for poor-quality wheat anymore; he was already contacting other buyers.



To maintain control over this trade route, a thirty percent discount was his last card. The distance between Willow Town and Border Town increased the cost of ore transportation, and Willow Town wasn't the only source of ore; they could offer a price possibly half of the market rate. As for Falling Dragon Ridge and Redwater Castle, they would offer even less, so the Fourth Prince might agree to let Longsong Stronghold maintain the monopoly—especially in the gem trade.



But the question was, would his father agree if he signed the contract on his own? Would the other five families think he was simply surrendering to Border Town and handing over the family's interests?



After all, in their eyes, Border Town was still just a pasture controlled by their own people in the stronghold, to take and demand as they pleased.



The two slowly made their way to the castle situated in the southeast corner of the town. Petro had been here before, but this time, the place had a new master.



The guards, upon seeing the ambassador's credentials, immediately went in to notify the lord.



The Fourth Prince, Roland Wimbledon, soon summoned Petro. As the two were led into the drawing room, the prince was already waiting in the main seat.



"Mr. Ambassador, please have a seat."



Roland clapped his hands, and a maid brought in a sumptuous meal. There was roasted chicken, mushroom stewed wild boar leg, buttered bread, and a large bowl of vegetable soup. Clearly, even in this remote place, the royal offspring's personal enjoyment was not compromised in the least.



Petro did not hesitate, having traveled by water from the stronghold to Border Town, a journey that took two days even with a favorable wind; and for a multi-masted cargo ship, it was slower, taking three to five days. There were no kitchens on board, and they usually ate dried meat strips or wheat cakes. Seeing the steaming hot dishes, he felt his mouth watering.



However, years of noble upbringing allowed him to maintain perfect dining etiquette, in contrast to His Highness, whose eating manners were much worse—especially with the use of knife and fork. Petro noticed that aside from cutting meat, the Fourth Prince performed all other actions with a pair of small wooden sticks. And it seemed... that the two sticks were much more convenient than a fork.



"How do you find it?" Roland suddenly asked as the meal was coming to an end.



"Uh, what?" The ambassador was momentarily at a loss.



"This," the other party shook the wooden stick in his hand, and without waiting for Petro to answer, went straight on, "An iron fork is a luxury for most people, let alone a silver one. Eating with hands directly makes it very easy to ingest the dirt along with the food. Illnesses enter through the mouth, you know?"



The ambassador didn't know how to respond. He didn't quite understand the meaning of illnesses entering through the mouth, but deduced from the previous sentence that it probably meant that eating dirty things stuck on food could lead to illness. However, everyone had been doing it this way, and he hadn't seen anyone die of illness because of it.



"A pair of oak sticks can be found in abundance in the Misty Forest, both clean and easily obtained. I plan to promote this in town," the prince took a sip of his wine, "Of course, right now my subjects have almost no meat to eat, but things will slowly get better."



Petro breathed a sigh of relief; this was something he knew how to respond to. After routinely expressing his agreement and best wishes, deep down he remained skeptical. All the subjects having meat to eat? Such a fanciful idea; even Greycastle couldn't achieve that, let alone Border Town in this remote place.
