## Envoy (Part 1)
"This place is still as dilapidated as ever." Ambassador Peter stepped out of the cabin, a smell of rotting wood assaulted his senses. The air was damp and stuffy, making him feel uncomfortable all over. He sniffed and looked up at the sky, which was a blanket of grey, seemingly on the verge of a downpour.



"You last came here a year ago, right?" The assistant diligently draped a wool coat over the ambassador, "There was nothing here but stones."



"It was a year and a half ago," Peter corrected, "The Duke sends different people each season, and it was summer when I last visited Border Town. And besides stones, there are also fine furs and..."



"What?" The assistant looked puzzled.



Peter shook his head and did not answer. He stepped over the gunwale onto the moss-covered dock, the wooden planks creaking under his feet. This dock will probably fall apart in a few years, he thought. Border Town had not only stones and furs but also... land. But there was no point in saying this out loud, as the assistant was just an obscure clerk from the city hall, unable to see the potential.



Between Border Town and Longsong Stronghold lay vast tracts of uncultivated land, bordered on one side by the Impassable Mountain Range and on the other by the Redwater River, like a narrow corridor. As the outpost of the stronghold, if it took up the responsibility of the defensive line, the vast lands in between would fall into the stronghold's hands. They were uncultivated and could be farmed multiple times without needing to lie fallow, with natural barriers on both sides, it wouldn't take much effort to take over. This could alleviate a series of problems caused by the growing population of the stronghold, and Border Town would become an integral part of the stronghold instead of being separate territories as it is now.



The only downside was that it would require three to five years of management and a large initial investment.



Unfortunately, when it came to the foresight in investment, most nobles were worse than a mediocre merchant.



"Eh, why is the yard empty?" The assistant pointed towards an open space in the distance, "Shouldn't they have prepared all the ore?"



Peter sighed softly, "Let's go to the castle to see His Highness."

"Wait... Mr. Ambassador, aren't you waiting for their reception team?"

He didn't know if there was one, but he thought this without saying it aloud, "Let's go, the stables are just ahead."

Now, the trouble of being divided into two separate territories was apparent. The king's decree to vie for kingship had thrown the Fourth Prince into this desolate land. What would a normal noble or royal offspring do? Naturally, they would claim everything here as their own. Exchange minerals and jewels for grain and bread? The prince probably only had eyes for gold royals.

If it were him, he would do the same. To watch one's own territory's output being exchanged at such a low price would be unacceptable to anyone. And the prince didn't necessarily have to go to the Stronghold. The family seemed to have forgotten one fact – the Redwater River didn't just flow through Longsong Stronghold. He could sell the ores at market prices to Willow Town, to Dragon Cliffs City, to Redwater City, and then take his people to these places for refuge— it was just a longer journey.

And what could Longsong Stronghold do then? Block the river and intercept the prince's entourage? That would be an outright defiance of the Greycastle royal family! Everyone knew that the Fourth Prince was not favored by the king, but regardless, he was still of the king's bloodline, and this was beyond doubt.

The two rode on rented horses, slowly moving along the cobblestone path by the river. The horses from the stables were all old, with mottled coats and skin and bones, trembling all over even at a slow pace. And for these two dunces, he had to pay two gold royals as a deposit.

"Look, sir, is that a boat from Willow Town?"

Hearing his assistant's shout, he looked in the direction pointed out and saw a single-masted sailboat with a flag bearing a green leaf and a curved blade slowly sailing along the river. The waterline of the boat was high, indicating it was laden with cargo.



Peter nodded blankly, but his heart sank a bit further—the other party was acting faster than he had anticipated. If the prince had already started contacting the towns downstream of the Redwater River, Peter's bargaining chips had just diminished. He had originally planned to persuade his father to agree to purchase the ore at a price 30% below the normal rate; they would still make a profit, not to mention luxury items like gems, whose value could increase manifold after processing. Unfortunately, the monopoly on this business was not up to him nor the Honeysuckle Family. There were six noble families involved in the Border Town mines, and without the majority's consent, they could not form a resolution.



But they were slow to react, thinking the situation was still the same... or perhaps the mine's output was too insignificant for them to bother with. Since the other five families remained indifferent and his father confidently rejected his proposal, they were gravely mistaken. The main reason for the low output was the barter system; if it shifted to regular trade, the more they exported, the more they would earn, and the ore output might very well increase by next year.



If negotiations continued under the previous monopoly scheme, they were unlikely, no, definitely not going to happen. Peter could tell just by looking at the empty wharf that the prince had no plans to exchange these stones for inferior wheat anymore—he was already contacting other buyers.



If he still wanted to maintain control over this trade route, offering a 30% discount was his last chip. The distance between Willow Town and Border Town raised the cost of transporting ore, and since Willow Town was not the only source of ore, the prices they offered could be half the market rate. As for Dragon Cliffs City and Redwater City, they would likely offer even lower prices, so the Fourth Prince might agree to let Longsong Stronghold maintain the monopoly—especially in the gem trade.



But the question was, if he unilaterally signed the contract, would his father agree? What about the other five families? Would they see his actions as surrendering to Border Town, giving up the family's interests?



After all, in their eyes, Border Town was still seen as their own grazing field, something controlled by the stronghold's own people, to take or leave as they pleased.



The two slowly made their way to the castle located at the southeastern corner of the town. Peter wasn't there for the first time, but this time, the place had changed hands.



Upon seeing the ambassador's credentials, the guard immediately went in to inform the lord.



The Fourth Prince, Roland Wimbledon, quickly summoned Peter. When they were led into the reception room, the prince was already waiting in the main seat.



"Mr. Ambassador, please take a seat."

Roland clapped his hands, signaling the maid to bring up a sumptuous meal. There was a roast chicken, mushroom stewed boar leg, butter bread, and a large bowl of vegetable soup. Clearly, even in this remote place, the royal offspring's personal indulgences were not the slightest bit compromised.



Peter naturally didn't hold back. Traveling by waterway from the stronghold to Border Town took two days even with a favorable wind; if it was a multi-masted and multi-oared cargo ship, it was even slower, taking three to five days. Since there was no kitchen on board, one typically ate dried meat strips or wheat biscuits. Seeing the steaming dishes in front of him, he felt his saliva surging in his throat.



However, years of noble upbringing still enabled him to maintain perfect dining etiquette, in contrast to His Highness, whose eating manners were much worse—especially when it came to using cutlery. Peter noticed that aside from cutting meat, the Fourth Prince performed all other actions with a pair of small wooden sticks. And it seemed... that the two sticks were actually much more convenient than a fork.



"How do you find it?" asked Roland, when the meal was nearing its end.



"Uh, what?" The ambassador was momentarily taken aback.



"This," the other party shook the wooden sticks in his hand, not waiting for Peter's response, he continued, "A metal dining fork is a luxury for most people, not to mention a silver one. And eating with one's hands directly makes it easy to ingest dirt along with the food. Illness enters through the mouth, you know?"



The ambassador didn't know how to answer; he didn't quite understand the meaning of illness entering through the mouth, but based on the previous sentence, he guessed it meant that dirty things sticking to the food when eaten could easily cause illness. However, everyone had been doing this all along, and he hadn't seen anyone die from it.



"A pair of oak sticks, there are as many as you want in the Misty Forest, clean and easy to obtain. I plan to promote this in the town," the prince sipped his wine, "Of course, right now my subjects have almost no meat to eat, but things will gradually get better."



Peter heaved a sigh of relief; this was a line he knew how to respond to. He routinely expressed his agreement and blessings, but deep down, he thought it was fanciful. To let all the common people have meat to eat? It was a flight of fancy, something even the kingdom had never achieved, let alone a remote place like Border Town.
