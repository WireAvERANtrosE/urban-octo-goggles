## Bright Wheel Boat Plan
Four days later, the caravan's ships raised their sails and left the dock. 

Tassa and a hundred First Army soldiers embarked with them, heading for the King's City.

During these days, Roland and Margaret had reached an agreement that Tassa could withdraw any amount of Gold royals from her shop, which would be deducted from the steam engine sales, in addition to which, Roland would also have to pay an extra one percent interest.

This time, the saltpeter and ore ingots brought by the other party were almost twice that of the previous time, but even after adding the deposit for the modification of two riverboats, Roland still received an income of more than 2,200 Gold royals, which was an unimaginable figure during the Evil Months — even selling ores for a month would only bring in about 300 Gold royals.

After the caravan left, it was also time for Maggie to temporarily leave Border Town.

According to the agreement with Ashes, she was going to the Fjords to bring news about the Western Region.

Roland specifically wrote her a long letter, not only expressing an attitude of mutual assistance and cooperation but also hoping that the Fifth Princess could send some support-type witches to help him. In the letter, he did not claim the identity of a brother but negotiated as the lord of Border Town and the governor of the Western Region. Although the likelihood of the other party agreeing was slim, he still wanted to try — after all, writing a few more words didn't take much effort.

The farewell took place in the backyard of the castle, where all the witches gathered.

Nightingale gave her a small bag of dried fish slices; Lightning gave her a packet of pepper powder.



The other witches approached with reluctance, stroking her feathers and hugging her farewell—as if it were a final goodbye.

"Don't worry, coo!" she raised her head, "I'll be back soon, coo!"

"What if Tilly doesn't let you come back?" Lightning said worriedly.

"Coo..." Maggie tucked her neck in thought for a moment, then shook her tail feathers, "Then I'll just fly back secretly, coo!"

"Then it's a deal," the little girl promised earnestly, "if you come back, I'll personally catch a bunch of birds and roast them for you to eat. And we'll save that beehive we found last time for you, to tackle it together when you're back."

"Coo!" she nodded repeatedly, "It's a deal, coo!"

What else could be said? Roland stood by, filled with emotion. In just a month, Maggie had been completely won over to his side. Well done, Lightning!

"Well then, goodbye everyone, coo!" Maggie spread her robust wings, took a short run on the ground before slowly taking off, circling twice, then gradually disappearing towards the southeast.

"She'll make it there safely," Roland watched her slow ascent, unable to help feeling a bit anxious for her.



"No problem," Lightning said without hesitation, and then tilted her head, "I should...right?"



After sending Maggie off, Roland quickly returned to his busy daily work.



This time, he had to draw up a complete set of design plans for the two ships left behind by the Crescent Moon Bay caravan for remodeling—these would also become the world's first paddle steamers powered by steam.



Since it uses a single power source, there is no need for a gearbox, and the steam engine's power shaft can be directly connected to the paddle wheel. Multiple intake pipes control the amount of steam intake, thus controlling the ship's speed. To slow down or stop the ship, you just need to close the intake pipe, and the excess steam will be released through the exhaust port. Meanwhile, the fire in the furnace remains burning, making it convenient to accelerate again.



The principle was not difficult, and Roland soon sketched out a rough model. To get accurate production drawings, he would still need to go to the site to measure the specific dimensions.



At this moment, Anna walked into the office holding a book.



"What's up?" he put down the quill pen and couldn't help but smile.



"I've finished this book." She placed the book on the desk, which was the "Fundamentals of Natural Science Theory."



Roland's smile suddenly froze on his face, wasn't this too exaggerated? She had finished all the mathematical and physical knowledge of high school level in just a few months? He didn't ask whether she understood it all because Anna's completion meant full comprehension; otherwise, she would definitely reread it or come to ask him.



"Are these drawings intended to replace sails with a steam engine to power a ship?" Anna's attention was quickly drawn to the sketches on the table. "But..."



"But what?"



"These two wheels are similar to paddles, right? They can generate thrust when they turn, but half of them are exposed, which seems like a waste of power. Why not submerge them completely in the water?"



"..." Roland was stunned for a moment, not sure what to say. A person born with knowledge simply couldn't exist, which meant that she made this judgment based on her immediate impression? His interest suddenly piqued, he asked, "Then what do you think would be a better way?"



Anna pondered for a while, picked up a pen, and began to draw on the paper.



Roland propped up his chin, watching her with interest as she concentrated on her drawing—the loose strands of hair from her hairpin swayed with her movements, her long eyelashes occasionally fluttering, her fair cheeks revealing a natural rosiness. Although he could only see her profile, the silhouette formed by the line from her nose bridge to her chin, extending to her neck, was a perfect and soft curve in the light.



"Would you like some fish slices?" Nightingale interjected, inserting her hand between the two of them.



"Mm," Anna nodded, accepting the snack from her, "Thank you."



With his view obstructed, Roland coughed twice and reluctantly moved his gaze back to the drawings on the table.



At first, Anna tried to place the paddle wheel horizontally and submerge it completely underwater, but this made it difficult to observe the position of the wheel when docking, which could easily lead to collisions with the dock or the pier.



Then she arranged the paddle wheel at the stern of the ship—this was also a common practice, but the transmission setup was much more complicated. After all, the cumbersome steam engine was not suitable for placement at the rear of the ship, and thus the drive shaft and gearbox would occupy a considerable portion of the hull.



When Roland saw her new blueprint, he couldn't help but admire her sharp thinking once again.

The sketch that Anna was pondering had come infinitely close to the arrangement of a single-shaft propeller. The steam engine was placed at the bottom of the hull, the drive shaft extended out below the waterline, and at the end, there were four square blades that looked somewhat like a windmill.



"I'm not sure if this will work," she hesitated, "Logically, as long as the blades maintain an angle, they should generate a horizontal thrust. However, I've reduced one paddle wheel, and relying solely on four blades might not be enough to propel the ship."



"Of course, it will work, it just needs some minor modifications," Roland took the goose feather pen from Anna's hand and sketched out the original appearance of the propeller, "Compared to the windmill shape, this design of the blades is more suitable for rotating in water. Your idea is completely correct, but the contract requires us to retrofit a paddle steamer, so let's stick with the first method—not because of technology, but as a commercial strategy." He paused, "I'm about to go measure the ship's data, do you want to come with me?"



Anna blinked her deep blue eyes, "Yes!"

Mastering the theory and then verifying it in practice is the best way to learn.

...



"Nightingale?"

As Anna followed the prince to the door, she saw that Nightingale was still examining the drawings on the table and couldn't help but speak out.

"Ah, you go ahead, I'll be right there."

After repeatedly comparing the sketches in her hand, she came to a conclusion: Isn't it just changing the position of where the wheels are placed?
