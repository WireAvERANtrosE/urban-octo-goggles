## Bright Wheel Boat Project
Four days later, the caravan raised its sails and left the dock.

Theo and a hundred First Army soldiers set sail with the ship, embarking on a journey to the King's City.

During these days, Roland and Margaret had reached an agreement. Theo could withdraw any amount of Gold Royals from her store, and this expense would be deducted from the amount received from the sale of the steam engines. In addition to that, Roland also had to pay an additional one percent interest.

This time, the amount of saltpeter and metal ingots the caravan brought was almost double that of the last time. However, even after adding the deposit for the modification of two riverboats, Roland still gained an income of more than two thousand two hundred Gold Royals, a figure that was almost unimaginable during the Months of Demons—selling ore for a whole month would only yield an income of three hundred Gold Royals.

After the caravan left, it was also the day for Maggie to temporarily leave Border Town.

According to the agreement set with Ashes, she would head to the Fjords to bring news about the Western Territory.

Roland specially wrote a lengthy letter for her to take along. In addition to expressing an attitude of mutual assistance and cooperation, he also hoped that the Fifth Princess could send some support-type witches to assist him. In the letter, he did not assume the identity of a brother but negotiated as the lord of Border Town and the administrator of the Western Territory. Although the likelihood of the other party agreeing was small, he still wanted to try—after all, writing a few more words wouldn't take much effort.

The farewell took place in the castle's backyard, where all the witches were present.

Nightingale gave her a small bag of dried fish slices; Lightning's gift was a packet of pepper powder.



The other witches approached with reluctance, caressing her feathers and hugging her goodbye—as if they were parting forever.

"Don't worry, coo!" she lifted her head, "I will be back soon, coo!"

"What if Tilly doesn't let you come back?" Lightning said worriedly.

"Coo..." Maggie retracted her neck in thought for a moment, then shook her tail feathers, "Then I'll just fly back secretly, coo!"

"Then it's a deal," the little girl solemnly promised, "If you come back, I'll personally catch a bunch of birds to roast for you. And the beehive we found last time, we'll wait and take it down together when you return."

"Coo!" She nodded repeatedly, "It's a deal, coo!"

What else is there to say? Roland thought to himself with a mix of emotions. In just one month, Maggie had been completely won over to his side. Well done, Lightning!

"Well then, goodbye everyone, coo!" Maggie spread her magnificent wings, took a running start on the ground before slowly taking off, circled twice, and then gradually disappeared into the southeast.

"She'll make it there safely, right?" Roland watched her slow ascent, unable to help but worry for her.



"No problem," Lightning said without hesitation, then tilted her head, "I should... right?"



After sending Maggie off, Roland quickly immersed himself again into his busy daily work.



This time, he was drawing a complete set of design blueprints for the two ships left by the Crescent Moon Bay caravan that were waiting to be modified—they would become the first paddle steamers in the world to use steam power.



Since they would use a single power source, there was no need for a gearbox, and the steam engine's power shaft could be directly connected to the paddle wheel. By controlling the amount of air intake with multiple intake pipes, the ship's speed could be controlled. To slow down or stop the ship, simply closing the air intake pipes would allow the excess steam to be released through the exhaust port. Meanwhile, the furnace would continue burning, making it convenient to accelerate again.



The principle was not difficult, and Roland quickly sketched out a rough model. To get accurate production blueprints, he would need to go to the site to measure the specific dimensions.



At this moment, Anna walked into the office holding a book.



"What's up?" he asked, putting down his quill and smiling involuntarily.



"I've finished this book." She placed the book on the office desk; it was the "Basics of Natural Science Theories."



Roland's smile suddenly froze on his face. Wasn't that an exaggeration? She had finished all the mathematics and physics knowledge of high school level in just a few months? He didn't ask whether she understood it all because Anna's completion meant full comprehension; otherwise, she would definitely have reviewed it repeatedly or come to ask him.



"These drawings of yours, you're thinking of using a steam engine to replace sails as the source of power for ships?" Anna's attention was quickly drawn to the sketches on the table. "But..."



"But what?"



"These two wheels are similar to oars, aren't they? They can generate thrust when they rotate, but half of them are exposed, which seems like a waste of power. Why not submerge them fully into the water?"



"..." Roland was taken aback, unsure of what to say. It was impossible for someone to be born with such knowledge, which meant that she had made these judgments based solely on a moment's impression? His interest suddenly piqued, he asked, "Then what do you think would be a better way to do it?"



Anna pondered for a moment, picked up a pen, and started to draw on the paper.



Roland propped his chin, watching with interest as she drew seriously—the fringe that had slipped from her hairpin swayed back and forth with her movements, her long eyelashes occasionally fluttered, and her fair cheeks revealed a natural rosy glow. Although from this angle he could only see her profile, the contour from her nose bridge to her chin and extending down to her neck formed a perfect and soft curve under the light.



"Would you like some fish slices?" Nightingale interjected, inserting her hand between the two.



"Mm," Anna nodded, accepting the snack passed by the other, "Thank you."



Roland, whose view was obstructed, coughed twice and had no choice but to shift his gaze back to the drawings on the table.



At first, Anna tried to place the paddle wheel horizontally and completely submerge it in water, but this made it difficult to observe the wheel's position when docking, making it easy to collide with the dock or pier.



Then she arranged the paddle wheel at the stern of the ship—an approach that is quite common. However, the transmission setup became much more complicated. After all, the cumbersome steam engine was not suitable for placement at the very end of the ship. As a result, the drive shaft and gear box would occupy a considerable part of the ship's body.



When Roland saw the new blueprint she had drawn, he couldn't help but admire her keen thinking abilities once again.



The sketch Anna was pondering over was infinitely close to the arrangement of a single-shaft propeller. The steam engine was placed at the bottom of the ship's body, with the drive shaft extending out from below the waterline, ending with four square-shaped blades that looked somewhat like a windmill.



"I'm not sure if this will work," she hesitated, "Logically, as long as the blades maintain an angle, they should generate a horizontal force. But I've reduced a paddle wheel, and relying on just four blades may not be enough to propel the ship."



"Of course, it can work, it just needs some minor modifications." Roland took the goose feather pen from Anna's hand and sketched out the original appearance of the propeller. "Compared to the windmill shape, this blade shape is more suitable for rotation in water. Your line of thought is completely correct, but the terms of the contract require transforming it into a paddle wheel ship, so we should stick to the first method—it's not about technology, but a business strategy." He paused for a moment, "I'm going to take actual measurements of the ship's body now, do you want to come with me?"



Anna blinked her azure blue eyes, "Hmm!"



Mastering the theory and then validating it in practice is the best way to learn.



...



"Nightingale?" 

When Anna followed the prince to the door, she saw Nightingale still examining the drawings on the table and couldn't help but speak up.

"Ah, you go ahead, I'll be right there."

After repeatedly comparing the sketches in her hand, she came to a conclusion: Isn't it just changing the position of where the wheels are placed?
