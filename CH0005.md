## Reason
"The Second Law of Thermodynamics: It is impossible to transfer heat from a colder body to a hotter body without producing some other effect, or to convert heat taken from a single heat source into work completely without producing some other effect, or for the entropy increase in an irreversible thermal process to be less than zero."

Roland copied this law neatly onto paper—using the script of this world. At first glance, it looked somewhat like worm writing; he really couldn't understand how the locals managed to learn such a complicated script.



If he had to choose the most boring among the many physical laws, Roland would undoubtedly pick the Second Law of Thermodynamics. It tells everyone that heat always flows from hot to cold in this world, chaos replaces order, and entropy is constantly increasing. In the end, everything would return to nothingness, and the universe would become utterly silent.



But this world had rid itself of the trouble of increasing entropy; magical power could be created from nothing, which was even greater than inventing a perpetual motion machine! The power of devils? Roland scoffed at that. They hadn't realized the nature of this force. To put it grandly, it could even change the entire universe.



Of course, for now, he could start by changing Border Town.



Humming a tune, Roland tore off the piece of paper and threw it into the fireplace, watching it turn into ash in the fire, feeling a sense of pleasure in eradicating the cage.



The assistant minister looked at the Fourth Prince's inexplicable action, completely befuddled. Fortunately, the other party had always been like this, acting out of tune when doing things, and he could tell that the prince was in a good mood.



"It's been taken care of, the 'witch' was hanged at noon," Barov reported.



"Hmm, no one noticed anything, right?" Roland tapped the pen lightly, "Anyway, they were all wearing hoods."



To prevent the Church and the Witch Cooperation Association from sniffing around, Roland ordered the prison warden to find a prisoner with a similar build from the dungeon to replace Anna, and besides the Chief Knight and the Minister Assistant, everyone else was rewarded with 20 Gold Royals to keep their mouths shut. This was an extremely generous income for them.



Barov had also suggested whether to silence the witnesses forever, but Roland flatly refused. He knew these secrets wouldn't be kept for long, but it didn't matter; he rather hoped someone would spread the news—just not now. Turning against the Church was a matter of time; no one could tolerate those idiots wasting resources like that! What would the witches think when they knew there was a small town on the kingdom's border where they could live freely and even be given generous treatment?



No matter the era, talent is the most important thing.



"So, that's settled," Roland instructed. "Next, I want a summary of Border Town's trade, tax revenue, and essential expenditures from the past year. Also, compile a count and scale of the workshops in the city, those involved in iron, textiles, pottery, and the like."



"It will take three days to organize these records, but..." Barov nodded first, then hesitated as if he had more to say.



"What else is it?" Roland knew it was time to test his ability to talk his way out. The other party would surely have questions about everything he had done yesterday; a dissolute lifestyle didn't mean stupidity. Hiding a witch was, in the eyes of the Minister Assistant, akin to making an enemy of the world.



"Your Highness, I don't understand..." Barov chose his words carefully, "Although you have been reckless in the past, those acts were harmless. But... why take such a great risk to save a witch? Hunting them is a law set by the Church, and your father, His Majesty Wimbledon, also agrees with it very much."



Roland thought for a moment and then asked, "Do you think Border Town is a good place?"



"Uh, well..." Although he didn't quite understand how this question related to his own, Barov still answered truthfully, "Not really."



"It's very bad, much worse than the situation in Valencia and Clearwater Harbor. How likely do you think it is that I could surpass my siblings?"

"..." The ministerial aide opened his mouth but did not reply.

"Almost zero. So I must find another way," Roland said expressionlessly, watching the other party step by step fall into the trap he had set, "a way that can leave a deep impression on my father."

He did not start from the angle of whether witches are inherently evil because that approach would be ineffective—Barov had been an aide to the Minister of Finance for twenty years and was a qualified politician. For a politician, interests are more persuasive than good and evil. Additionally, taking the emotional route was also not suitable for him; recalling the previous actions of the fourth prince, he found that he could not be considered a part of the lawful good faction.

So he chose the eternal conflict between secular royal power and religious authority as his entry point, the growing influence of the church was a thorn in the side of King Wimbledon III. The church claimed that the world operated according to the will of God, and the Pope was the spokesperson of God. If people discovered that what he said was also not the truth, full of loopholes, the ruling power of the religion would be greatly shaken.

It was difficult to convince someone with the argument "witches are not evil creatures, so I want to save them," but it was easy to lead Barov to his intended conclusion with "witches are not evil creatures, and I can use this to attack the church."

"No matter how prosperous my brothers and sisters make their territories, they are but possessions in the church's bag. They have been vigorously promoting the divine right of kings; if only those crowned by the Pope can be considered lawful kings, then who really rules this land?" Roland paused, "And my father can see such a hope in me: a kingdom where the royal family enjoys all the rights without the restraint of the church. Then his choice becomes very clear."

Changing "enemy of the entire world" to "enemy of the church alone" makes it much easier for people to accept—especially since Barov himself is on the side of the royal family.

"Similarly, if he realizes that these people with peculiar abilities are the fulcrum to leverage the church, then the hunting decree is nothing but a joke. On one side is an impossibility, on the other side, a possibility that is not zero. Do you think I should take this risk?" Roland stared at the ministerial aide, word by word, "Don't doubt my decision, Barov. You've been a ministerial aide for twenty years, right? If I become Wimbledon IV, you can drop the 'aide' from your title. Or perhaps even further, like... the Hand of the King?"



Looking at Barov's retreating back as he took his leave, Roland let out a slight sigh of relief. It was evident that Barov did not take his own promise seriously, which was normal. Even Roland himself had never believed that this wildly ambitious plan he had just concocted could be realized. But that was not important. What mattered was to make Barov believe that Roland was indeed serious about it—a rudimentary plan that a profligate son could come up with, not only aligning with the Fourth Prince's disdain for the Church but also paving the way for recruiting more witches in the future.



As for his own true thoughts? Even if they knew, they would not understand.



Roland called for a maid. "Ask Miss Anna to come see me."



Next, it was time to get down to business. He thought with a sense of excitement.
