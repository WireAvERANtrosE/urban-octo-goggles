## Reason
"The Second Law of Thermodynamics: It is impossible to transfer heat from a colder body to a hotter body without producing other effects, or to extract heat from a single heat source and convert it into useful work without producing other effects, or the entropy of a non-reversible thermodynamic process always increases." Roland copied this law neatly onto the paper—using the script of this world. At first glance, it looked a bit like worm writing, and he couldn't understand how the locals managed to learn such a complicated form of writing.



Among the many laws of physics, if Roland had to choose the most boring one, it would definitely be the Second Law of Thermodynamics. It tells everyone that heat in this world always flows from high to low, disorder replaces order, and entropy is constantly increasing. In the end, everything will turn to nothingness, and the universe will become dead and silent.



However, this world has escaped the trouble of increasing entropy; magic can be created from nothing, which is even more magnificent than inventing a perpetual motion machine! The power of demons? Roland sneered at that; they had no understanding of the essence of this power. Speaking on a larger scale, it could even change the entire universe.



Of course, for now, he could start by changing Border Town.



Humming a tune, Roland tore the piece of paper and threw it into the fireplace, watching it turn to ashes in the fire, feeling the pleasure of destroying a cage.



The minister's assistant looked at the fourth prince's incomprehensible actions with confusion, but since the other party had always been like this, doing things out of tune, and he could tell that the prince was in a good mood.



"It's done, the 'witch' was hanged at noon," Barov reported.



"Hmm, no one saw anything amiss, right?" Roland tapped the pen lightly, "After all, they were all hooded."



To prevent the church and the Witch Cooperation Association from coming to him, Roland ordered the jailer to find a death row inmate with a similar build to replace Anna, and apart from the Chief Knight and the minister's assistant, everyone was given 20 Gold Royals as hush money. This was a substantial income for them.



Barov had also suggested making the witnesses permanently silent, but Roland rejected this outright. He knew these secrets wouldn't be kept for long, but it didn't matter; he actually hoped someone would spread the news—just not now. Falling out with the church was bound to happen sooner or later, who could tolerate those idiots squandering resources like that! What would other witches think when they learn there's a small town on the edge of the kingdom that allows them to live freely and even provides them with generous treatment?



In any era, talent is the most important thing.



"Then let's leave it at that," Roland instructed, "Next, summarize the trade, taxes, and necessary expenditures of Border Town over the past year for me to review. And also count the number of workshops in the town, like those for ironware, textiles, pottery, and such, and their size."



"It will take three days to compile these records, but..." Barov nodded and then hesitated as if he wanted to say more.



"What else is there?" Roland knew it was time to test his ability to talk his way out. The other party would surely have questions about everything he did yesterday. Just because he was a profligate didn't mean he was stupid. Hiding a witch like this, in the eyes of the minister's assistant, was akin to being at odds with the world.



"Your Highness, I don't understand..." Barov chose his words carefully, "In the past, although you were reckless, it was all harmless. But... why take such a great risk to save a witch? Hunting them down is a law set by the church, but your father, His Majesty Wimbledon, also agrees strongly with it."



Roland pondered for a moment before counter-asking, "Do you think Border Town is a good place?"

"Er, this..." Although not quite understanding how this question was related to his own, Barov still answered truthfully, "Not really."

"It's very bad. Compared to Golden City and Clearwater Port, how likely do you think it is for me to surpass my siblings?"

"..." The Assistant Minister opened his mouth but did not reply.

"Almost zero. So I have to try a different way," Roland said expressionlessly, watching the other party step by step fall into the trap he had set, "A way to make a deep impression on Father."

He didn't start from the angle of whether witches were evil, because that would be of little effect—Barov had been an assistant to the Minister of Finance for twenty years and was a qualified politician. For a politician, interests are more persuasive than good and evil. Also, the emotional approach was not suitable for him either. Roland recalled the previous actions of the Fourth Prince and found that he really couldn't be considered as part of the lawful good camp.

So he chose the eternal conflict between secular royal power and religious authority as the entry point. The growing power of the church was a thorn in the side of King Wimbledon III. The church claimed that the world operated according to the will of God, and the Pope was God's spokesperson. If the people discovered that what he said was not the truth, full of flaws, then the ruling power of religion would be greatly shaken.

It was difficult to convince someone with the statement "Witches aren't evil, so I want to save them," but it was easy to lead Barov to the predetermined conclusion with "Witches aren't evil, and I can use this to attack the church."

"No matter how prosperous my brothers and sisters make their territories, they are just possessions in the hands of the church. They are already promoting the divine right of kings; if only the one crowned by the Pope can be regarded as the legitimate king, then are we really the rulers of this land?" Roland paused, "Whereas Father can see such hope in me: a kingdom where the royal family enjoys all rights without the control of the church. Then his choice becomes very clear."

Replacing 'being enemies with the whole world' with 'being enemies only with the church' made it much easier for people to accept—especially since Barov himself was on the side of the royal family.

"Likewise, if he realizes that these people with strange abilities could be the fulcrum to leverage the church, the hunting decree is nothing but a laughable document. On one side is impossibility, on the other is a non-zero chance, do you think it's worth the risk for me?" Roland stared at the Assistant Minister, saying each word deliberately, "Don't doubt my decision, Barov. You've been an assistant minister for twenty years, right? If I become Wimbledon IV, you can drop the 'assistant' from your title. Or perhaps go even further, to something like... the Hand of the King?"

...

Watching Barov leave after being dismissed, Roland breathed a sigh of relief. It was evident that he didn't take Roland's promises too seriously, which was normal, as even Roland himself didn't believe that this arrogant plan he had just concocted could be realized. But that wasn't important, the key was to make Barov believe that he really thought this way—a simple plan thought up by a profligate that not only fit the Fourth Prince's dislike of the church but also paved the way for recruiting more witches in the future.

As for his real thoughts? Even if they knew, they wouldn't be able to understand.

Roland summoned a maid, "Call Miss Anna to see me."

Next, it was time for serious business. He thought excitedly.
