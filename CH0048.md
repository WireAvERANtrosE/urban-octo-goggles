## Assembly Horn
Just as Roland was getting excited, preparing to launch into a lengthy discussion about how to establish a reasonable market, the buzzing of a horn came from afar!

The alarm horn for a full assembly was only blown when the patrolling guards were unable to handle the situation.

Roland and Carter exchanged glances and immediately quickened their pace out of the castle's backyard. The personal guard had already prepared the horses, and Roland mounted his horse, leading Carter and his men towards the direction of the city walls.

As the group ascended the city walls, the militia had taken their positions, and a row of guns stood erect on the wall, which brought a bit of relief to Roland—his investment in the eggs had not been in vain.

He looked toward the northwest, and at the edge of his field of vision, a group of dark figures was approaching Border Town. The prince estimated their number to be around twenty or so.

Iron Axe came jogging over from his defensive position, saluted, and reported, "Your Highness, there's something odd about this pack of demonic beasts."

"Odd? You mean they don't usually move in groups?" Roland asked.

"That's not it," Iron Axe explained, "If they were group animals before their fall, they would still retain this habit after becoming demonic beasts—for example, wolves. But this pack of demonic beasts isn’t of the same kind, which means they shouldn't be moving together. There have also been hunters who observed them fighting each other."

Demonic beasts themselves are mutated wild beasts, and their behavior largely retains that of wild beasts, with an even stronger desire to hunt. In a sense, the intelligence of demonic beasts is even lower than that of wild beasts because their irascible nature makes them forget even the principle of seeking benefits and avoiding harm.



Roland carefully observed for a moment and noticed that there were indeed creatures of various sizes within the beast horde; there were at least wolves and wild buffaloes among them. However, this did not prove that they suddenly gained intelligence and knew the importance of sticking together.

This was because they were still being led by the barriers and traps set up by Iron Axe, gradually concentrating in front of the city walls.

Tanner felt his palms getting sweaty, and the spot where he gripped his gun's barrel became slippery. Taking advantage of the moment when no one was paying attention, he stealthily wiped his hands on his clothes.

The hunters responsible for observation kept repeating the same words: "Relax, take a deep breath." Tanner had done this countless times but still couldn't stop his heart from racing. He had lived in the Western Region for over ten years and what he heard the most were the ferocious and brutal tales of demonic beasts. Since the Evil Months, the sight of solitary demonic beasts being shot one by one by the hunters beneath the city walls had eased his fear of them. He once thought of himself as a brave veteran of battle, but facing such a multitude of monsters for the first time today, he still felt his legs trembling.

Remembering that His Highness had chosen him as the deputy commander of the Spear Squad, Tanner tried to maintain a calm demeanor, keeping his posture ready with his gun at the ready.

The group of monsters was getting closer, and he could now make out their shapes; leading the charge was a wild buffalo, with two dark, thick horns on its head as thick as his own arms. The hair growing on its back covered its body like a cloak. When it was only thirty feet from the wall, Tanner felt as if the ground itself was trembling. He licked his dry lips, waiting for the hunter to give the command to strike.

Then there was a loud boom.

The demonic beast didn't slow down at all and just crashed straight into the wall, its head instantly pulverizing, with black blood splattering all over the wall.

Before Tanner could even catch his breath, the two wolf creatures that followed closely behind were already leaping up, stepping on the back of the buffalo.



"Stab!"

The hunter's roar echoed in Tanner's ears, and he instinctively thrust out his long spear—not that the demonic beast had pounced in his direction. The combined assault was clearly not as effective as it had been during training; a row of long spears on the city wall thrust out in succession, some having lunged their spears the moment they saw the demonic beast leap, while others, upon hearing the command, took forever to react.

As a result, only one demonic beast was repelled, while another leaped through the gaps between the spears and landed on the wall.

"Maintain formation!" the hunter roared.

Though Tanner wanted to turn his head to see which target the evil creature would attack, the warning that Iron Axe had repeatedly emphasized during training took effect: when one's attention is drawn away by a noise behind, the front becomes the most dangerous area. He kept his eyes fixed on the next wave of evil creatures about to arrive, gripping his long spear tightly.

The experience of the hunting team was clearly much richer than that of the spear team.

Before the demonic beast even touched the ground, the hunters had already unsheathed their curved blades. Iron Axe, agile as ever, took two steps towards the creature, flipped the butt of his spear upward, and smashed it hard into the beast's waist, sending it tumbling several times in the air.

The mutated evil beasts, with their enhanced physical abilities and defenses, were unlikely to be severely injured by such an attack. It landed, quickly got back on its feet, and bared its sharp fangs.

But Iron Axe's spear tip was already pressed against its forehead.



A gunshot rang out—

The demonic beast's head flew off completely, and its body, deprived of its brain, staggered back two steps before collapsing to the ground, twitching.

"This beast is already dead, continue to hold your positions!"

"Ah! My stomach—" someone screamed in agony.

Tanner glanced over with the corner of his eye and saw a team member sitting against the wall, clutching his belly tightly, his hands already smeared with blood.

"His intestines are spilling out."

"It was when that wolf-type pounced that it clawed him!"

"Save me..."

"Damn it, get a cloth to bind it!"



The scene was chaotic, but fortunately, the next few demonic beasts that rushed to the city wall were all wild boar types. Despite their thick skin and flesh, they were shot into porcupines by the hunters' hand crossbows at such close range.



"Everyone, don't panic!" Roland, who had been held up by Nightingale and had only just arrived, shouted, "Have you all forgotten what to do when someone is injured during training? Execute according to the regulations!"



The prince's words instantly snapped Tanner back to reality. He remembered his duty; as the deputy leader of the defense team for that section of the wall, he should organize a rescue when someone is injured.



He called out the names of two teammates, "You two, carry him to the medical center, quickly!"



Based on his past experience, he judged that the man had little chance of survival, but His Highness had said that whether or not to act is one thing, and whether to succeed is another. As a member of the militia, one must prioritize executing orders and regulations.



After the injured were taken away, order was finally restored on the city wall. This wave of demonic beasts seemed numerous, but only a few posed a threat to the people on top of the wall.



The hunting team killed the remaining demonic beasts one by one, and Tanner also breathed a sigh of relief. The entire battle lasted only half an hour, yet he felt as though all his strength had been drained.



Just then, a hunter on the watchtower responsible for the lookout cried out again, "My God, what is that..."



Tanner also saw the target.



Although it was still a good distance away from the city wall, its silhouette made it clear that this creature was enormous. Tanner swore that even ten cows stacked on top of each other would not compare to the size of the beast before them.

Only the experienced Iron Axe immediately recognized the newcomer.

He took in a sharp breath. Without a doubt, this was a mixed breed, and they were in trouble.
