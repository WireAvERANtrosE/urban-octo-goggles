## Exploration Society
The night faded, and a dim light shone through the gap in the curtains.

Dawn had arrived.

Agatha had barely slept all night, her mind filled with Nightingale's words.

"The people across the continent are the most powerful group."

"Four hundred years can change a lot of things, why do you still cling to the old concepts and refuse to let go?"

"There is still plenty of time, and you can verify it with your own eyes."

She rolled out of bed, walked over to the coat rack, and touched the robe that symbolized the Quest Society of Taquila. She remembered how thrilled she was to have received the robe unanimously approved by the three seats. Exploring the mysteries of magic was her lifelong pursuit, and the most believed saying of the Quest Society was "existence is truth." If those mortals could really prove their strength...

Agatha donned her robe and pushed the door open, heading for the hall.

Regardless, she might be the last member of the Quest Society and the sole survivor of Taquila. Rebuilding the new Holy City was not something that could be done in a day or two. Before that, she might as well see for herself what this mortal prince is capable of, to command the obedience of witches.



After breakfast, Agatha, accompanied by Wendy, went to the office of the prince with gray hair.



His attire was not much different from four hundred years ago, but the feeling he gave was distinct from the common mercenaries, merchants, and farmers in the lower part of the city, and also different from the family's head guard, Kaf. Most of them could be judged at a glance, and even their deepest thoughts could be guessed accurately, as simple as an empty symbol. However, this way of recognition did not apply to the prince, especially his eyes. They were just ordinary gray pupils, yet they seemed to be filled with an indescribable spirit and confidence, particularly the latter. Unlike the confidence brought by blind optimism, it stemmed from a calmness and peace that did not match his age, as if he had lived... for thousands of years, mastering everything in the world.



Why did she feel this way?



His name was Roland Wimbledon, Agatha silently memorized this name in her heart.



"How did you rest last night?" He smiled. "The barley porridge and fried eggs after four hundred years should still suit your taste, right?"



"Fairly well, if only you hadn't sent a witch to enter my room without permission."



He was slightly startled and then shook his head helplessly, "Alright, she will knock on the door in the future. By the way, if you want to go out for a walk, visit the town and people's customs of this era, you can ask Nightingale to guide you. If you want to check historical books, you can inquire with Scroll. She has all the books she has read memorized in her head."



"People's customs?" Agatha frowned. "The threat of the devils is imminent. I just want to see how you dare to boast that humans can defeat the devils. If we cannot stop their assault, history and customs are meaningless!"



The prince smirked, "Compared to heavy industry, light industry and people's livelihood are also very important... Why is everyone so interested in artillery?"



"What is important and what is not?"

"No, nothing..." the other party exhaled, "You will see, this afternoon there is a performance test for the new weapons. But before that, I have some questions for you—about the Holy City of Taquila from 450 years ago."

Weapons operated by mortals? Agatha couldn't help but think of crossbows and catapults. If it was just an improved version of these, it would be far from enough to deal with the devils. However, she didn't show her doubts, "Ask away."

"You mentioned before that Taquila was a city ruled by witches, and ordinary people without magical power could only be considered as the lower class. So, how many meals do they eat a day? What is their staple food, and do they eat much meat?"

Agatha was taken aback; she hadn't expected to be asked such questions, "The commoners also have different statuses. Those who can serve the senior witches, handling miscellaneous chores and city defense, are equivalent to the weakest auxiliary witches. Next come the farmers and merchants, and lastly the slaves and laborers. As for your questions, I can't answer them—no witch living in the upper district would pay attention to what ordinary people eat. As for the guards and servants in my tower, they are provided with three meals a day, and except during the Evil Months, they get to eat meat once a week."

"How much are they paid?"

"What is that, money?" she raised an eyebrow, "They become part of my retinue, swear to serve me for life, and in return, I provide them with shelter and food, impart knowledge to them, and beyond that, no other compensation is required."

"I see," the other party wrote something down on the paper with interest, "Activities like farming, raising livestock, and forging ironware, do witches also participate in these?"

"Of course, these are tasks for the auxiliary witches," Agatha answered, "Even them, they are much more proficient than the ordinary people—if left to mortals alone, it would be impossible to meet the needs of the Union."



This back-and-forth questioning lasted for nearly half an hour. He seemed to be particularly interested in the clothing, food, housing, and transportation of the witches in the major cities, asking in great detail, which puzzled Agatha. Compared to these trivial matters, was he not concerned about the devils who had already occupied most of the Dawn Region and were about to launch another invasion?



The prince took a short break and handed over the content he had recorded to a scroll, "You said you are a member of the Quest Society, which specializes in researching magic stones and magic power?"



Finally, a question that seemed somewhat substantial. Agatha nodded, "That's right, the so-called magic stones are all transformed from the Divine Stone of Judgement. They can suppress the abilities of a witch, as well as enable a witch to exert completely different powers."



This statement surprised everyone, and the witch who claimed to be Tilly blurted out, "How is that done?"



She finally regained the feeling of being valued as in the past and couldn't help feeling a little proud, "This is the secret that the Quest Society has been pursuing for over four hundred years. In order to figure out the connection between magic power and magic stones, countless efforts have been made. I can tell you, but you must also provide knowledge that can increase the likelihood of awakening a witch in exchange."



Tilly and Roland exchanged glances, "That's certainly no problem, but I have one doubt that I don't understand." She raised her left hand, the blue crystal ring on her finger reflecting a striking luster, "This magic stone was discovered in ancient ruins, and it allows me to have the ability to fly freely—undoubtedly, such magic stones are extremely powerful, and in battle against the devils, whether for attacking or retreating, they can give the troops an advantage, not to mention saving a lot of travel time on ordinary days." She paused, "But why did you still rely on walking when you retreated? Even as a high-tier awakened like yourself, you don't possess such a convenient magic stone, isn't that a bit strange?"
