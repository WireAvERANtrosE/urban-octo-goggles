## Eileen's Wish
The two of them returned home, and Philip shook his head helplessly. "Couldn't you have considered for a few more days before answering His Highness?"



He saw his wife nearly skipping as she walked when she came back, the last time he saw her this happy was probably at their wedding.



"No way," Irene stuck out her tongue, "Even one more day would keep me awake at night."



Indeed, she loved drama so much. At the stronghold theater, she often practiced alone until midnight and frequently rehearsed lines with herself. If it weren't for the Duke, she would have probably gone from the flower of the theater to the veritable star of the theater. Thinking of this, he gently embraced his wife from behind, "I'm sorry."



"..." Irene patted his head, "It's not your fault, you were assigned to another city at that time and couldn't stop him." She smiled lightly, "If you want to express your apology, go cook. I want to take a look at the script first."



"Alright, alright, I'll cook." Philip kissed her earlobe, "Porridge with meat and fried eggs, plus a portion of roasted sausage as a celebration."



Their new home had many arrangements that were different from the residences he was familiar with. For example, the stove used for cooking, in Longsong Stronghold, whether for nobles or commoners, there would be an open hearth built in the center of the main living room, rather than like in the new home, where a room was separately partitioned to place the stove. The stove was surrounded on three sides, with the back leading directly to the chimney. There was a horizontally movable baffle at the entrance of the passage, which could be pushed in to close when not in use, to prevent smoke and dust from the residents below from coming up through the stove.



Philip could easily think of the benefits of such a design. Once the door was closed, the living room could be kept free from the influence of cooking fumes and smells, and in the summer, it could also effectively reduce the indoor temperature.



Having filled the stove with firewood and sawdust, and kindling the flames, he began to concentrate on preparing tonight's dishes.



After dinner, Irene continued to immerse herself in the scripts, and it was almost when the candle burned out that she put down the third book and let out a long sigh.

"How is it?" Philip couldn't help but be curious. What kind of script could have taken her so long to read? He knew that back at the theater, she could go through a dozen such thick volumes in half a day.

"It's really... indescribable," Irene exclaimed, "Each one is full of new ideas. I've never read stories like these! In 'Cinderella,' the prince falls in love not with a princess, but with a beautiful commoner girl... That's not strange, but he insists on taking a commoner as his wife. I even wonder, wouldn't His Highness feel discontent with the absurd content in this story? But putting that aside, the whole story is thrilling, especially when the prince finds Cinderella again and puts the glass slipper on her foot, I couldn't help wanting to applaud for them."

"'The Midnight Rooster Crows' is also very interesting. It's much simpler than 'Cinderella,' I think it could be told in just two or three scenes. And the depiction of the serfs gathering the courage to resist the nobility is very splendid; after a long build-up, the transition of the serfs' emotions from enduring to unbearable is fully presented... The sense of explosion when they finally decide to rebel is exhilarating!"

"Serfs resisting nobility?" Philip frowned. This was something nobles could never tolerate. If the serfs in the Eltek Manor dared to confront the lord with hoes and spades, his father would probably have their heads on pikes at the manor's gate the next day. "Does His Highness really want you to perform such a drama?"

"That's because you haven't read the script," Irene gave him a look, "After reading it, you would feel the same as I do. Standing up to resist is a last resort. The small nobles are simply too bullying—facing life-threatening oppression, they only put the nobles in sacks and beat them up severely, which I think is very restrained. Later, when the nobles wanted to execute all the serfs, a passing witch saved them. She turned into the image of a well-known local noble to stop the villains, and then went to the lord's castle to plead for the serfs. The lord made a wise and merciful decision after a debate—he bought those serfs and then promoted them to free folk! I bet that when this part is performed, the entire audience will cheer."

But surely the nobles would protest, Philip thought skeptically. Then the theater would face pressure from the nobles, and eventually, the troupe would be disbanded... Wait, he suddenly realized, apart from Viscount Titus and His Highness, there were no other nobles living in Border Town. And the latter was the one who had set up the troupe. That is to say, the few plays that His Highness requested to perform were really only intended for the common people? But there was hardly any money to be made from them in terms of Bronze royals. If they were to pay the troupe at the standard of the Stronghold Theater, it would be a losing business. Could it be that His Highness was doing it just for his own amusement?

"However, my dear," Irene hadn't noticed the change in his expression, "Although the first two scripts are exciting enough, they are nothing compared to the third one, 'The Witch's Diary'! I bet that even if it were taken to big cities like Redwater City or the capital, it would be a story that would make a theater immediately pick out a troupe to rehearse and promote it in advance! I have to say, the author is a genius playwright, this 'Witch's Diary,' whether in terms of story content or narrative technique, is far superior to any play today."

"Are you sure?" Philip was amused by her serious demeanor, "Even when I was in Longsong Stronghold, I often heard of the great name of Mr. Kajen Fels, his 'Rose's Soul' and 'The Prince's Love Quest' are highly praised works, not only in the capital, but I heard that troupes from other kingdoms also come to watch and learn. Do you think it's better than these classic plays?"



"Of course, you're doubting my judgment, dear!" She briefly described the content of the script, "Not to mention the plot, the novelty of this narrative technique is something I've never seen before. Unlike past dramas that are like listening to a third party recount a story, this one focuses the perspective firmly on the three witches throughout. Each of their actions has a profound impact on the others, yet they are completely unaware of it. However, near the middle of the story, seemingly unrelated clues all come together, and the three witches thus form an inseparable whole. I must say, this new framework with multiple lines driving the story forward will definitely cause a sensation—of course, not in Border Town. I even doubt how many people can appreciate it at this level." She excitedly fetched paper and pen and began to write a letter, "No, I need to call over my colleagues from the theater right away. I really want to see their surprised faces soon!"



Philip, however, stepped forward and held her hand, "Wait, Irene, don't you think... this story is too far-fetched?"



After listening to his wife's description, he also found the story gripping. The portrayal of human nature, whether good or evil, virtue or vice, was deeply compelling. However, the depiction of witches was completely contrary to the Church's teachings, and it was also too detailed—for instance, the third lucky one, due to her family's love, could release her powers uncontrollably, ultimately realizing that the demonic possession was nothing but a lie. Apart from manipulating magical power, witches have no difference from ordinary people; they also laugh, cry, and are devastated by the loss of loved ones. Isn't Prince Roland afraid that once the news gets out, the Church will come knocking?



"Contrary to common sense? No... Philip, before becoming witches, they were all ordinary people, right?"



"Uh, yes, that's correct."



"What about me?" Irene's eyes widened, "If I became a witch, would you think I'm a villain?"



"No, of course not," Philip quickly replied, "You'll always be the kind-hearted girl I know."



"What if we had a daughter, and she became a witch?"



"That's even less likely—" He suddenly closed his mouth, already understanding his wife's point. Judging witches from an outsider's perspective and branding one's own loved ones as evil are entirely different things.



"Exactly," Irene nodded in satisfaction, "If we really do have a witch..."

"I will love and care for her just like the father of the third witch in the stories," the knight knelt on one knee, assuming the pose of swearing allegiance.

"That's the proper answer," she put down her quill pen, laughing softly, "I think... we can try right now."

"As you wish, my dear." He whispered in her ear, then scooped her up in his arms and headed for the bedroom.
