## Irene's Wish
The two returned home, and Phyllis shook his head helplessly. "Couldn't you have considered for a few more days before replying to His Highness?"



He saw that his wife was almost skipping with joy when she came back. The last time he had seen her this happy was probably at their wedding.



"No way," Irene stuck out her tongue, "I wouldn't be able to sleep even one more day."



That was true. She loved acting so much that she would often practice alone in the fortress theater until midnight and frequently rehearsed her lines with him. If it weren't for the Duke, she would have already gone from being the flower of the theater to the true star of the theater. Thinking of this, he gently embraced his wife from behind. "I'm sorry."



"..." Irene patted his head. "It's not your fault. You were transferred to another city at that time and couldn't stop him." She chuckled softly, "If you want to show your apology, go cook. I want to take a look at the script first."



"Alright, alright, I'll cook." Phyllis kissed the tip of her ear. "Porridge with meat and fried eggs, plus a serving of roasted sausage as a celebration."



The new home's arrangements were quite different from the residences he was familiar with. For example, the stove used for cooking. In Longsong Stronghold, whether for nobles or commoners, an open hearth would be built in the center of the main living room, rather than having a separate room for the stove like in their new home. The stove was surrounded on three sides and backed directly onto a chimney. The entrance had a movable baffle that could be pushed inwards to close when not in use, to prevent smoke and dust from the downstairs neighbors from coming up through the stove.



Phyllis could easily see the benefits of such a design; with the door closed, the living room could be kept free from the influences of cooking fumes and smells, and in summer, it could effectively reduce the indoor temperature.



After filling the stove with firewood and sawdust and lighting a flame, he began to focus on preparing tonight's meal.



After dinner, Irene continued to immerse herself in the scripts, and it wasn't until the candle was nearly spent that she put down the third book, letting out a long sigh.



"How is it?" Phyllis couldn't help but be curious. What kind of scripts had made her spend such a long time reading them? She knew that back at the theater, Irene could go through more than a dozen books this thick in half a day.



"It's... indescribable," Irene exclaimed in admiration, "Each one is full of novelty, I've never seen such stories before! In 'Cinderella,' the prince falls in love not with a princess, but with a beautiful commoner girl... That's not strange, but he insists on taking a commoner as his wife. I even wonder if His Highness would feel discontented with the absurd content in this story? Setting that aside, the entire story is captivating, especially when the prince finds Cinderella again and puts the glass slipper on her foot, I couldn't help but want to applaud for them."



" 'The Midnight Rooster' is also very interesting. It's much simpler than 'Cinderella.' I think it could be told in two or three scenes. The description of the serf mustering up the courage to resist the noble was done brilliantly. After a long buildup, the emotional transition from enduring to the point of no longer being able to bear it is fully presented... The sense of explosion when they finally decide to rebel is exhilarating!"



"Serfs resisting nobles?" Phyllis frowned, such matters were absolutely intolerable to the nobility. If the serfs in the Silt Manor dared to confront their lord with hoes and shovels, she feared her father would have their heads displayed at the manor gate the next day. "Does His Highness really want you to perform this kind of drama?"



"That's because you haven't read the script," Irene gave him a look, "After reading it, you'll feel the same way I do. Standing up to resist is a last resort, the petty nobles are simply too oppressive—faced with life-threatening coercion, they just bagged the nobles and gave them a good thrashing, which I think is already very restrained. Later, when the nobles wanted to execute all the serfs, a passing witch saved them. She transformed into the image of a well-known local noble to stop the villains, then went to the lord's castle to plead for the serfs. After some debate, the lord made an enlightened and merciful decision—he bought the serfs and then promoted them to freemen! I bet that when it's performed, the entire audience will definitely cheer."



But the nobility would surely protest, Phyllis thought disapprovingly, and then the theater would come under pressure from the nobles, eventually disbanding the troupe... Wait, he suddenly realized, aside from Viscount Titus and His Highness, there were no other nobles living in Border Town, and the latter was the troupe's founder. Did that mean that the plays His Highness requested to be performed were really only intended for the common people to watch? But they couldn't make much from Bronze royals from them. If they were to pay the wages at the standard of the fortress theater, it would be a losing deal. Could it be that His Highness was only doing this for his own entertainment?



"However, my dear," Irene hadn't noticed the change in his expression, "although the first two scripts are fascinating, they are nothing compared to the third book 'The Witch Diaries'! I bet that even if it were brought to big cities like Redwater City or the capital, it would be a story that would immediately make a theater pick out a troupe, rehearse specially, and promote it extensively in advance! I have to say, the author is a genius scriptwriter, 'The Witch Diaries,' in terms of both content and narrative technique, far surpasses any play today."



"Are you sure?" Phyllis was amused by her serious demeanor, "Even in Longsong Fortress, I often hear of the great Mr. Kajen Fels, his 'To the Rose' and 'The Prince's Love Story' are both widely praised works, not only in the capital, but I heard that troupes from other kingdoms also come to observe and learn, do you think it's better than these classic plays?"



"Of course, you're doubting my judgment, my dear!" She briefly went over the content of the script, "Not to mention the plot, this is the first time I've come across such an innovative narrative technique. Compared to previous dramas that are like listening to a third party narrate a story, this one keeps the perspective firmly focused on the three witches throughout, with each of their actions having a profound impact on the others, yet they themselves are unaware. But as the story approaches the midpoint, seemingly unrelated clues all come together, and the three witches thus form an inseparable whole. I have to say, this new structure of advancing the story with multiple concurrent threads is bound to cause a sensation — of course, not in Border Town, where I even wonder how many people can appreciate it at this level." She excitedly fetched some paper and a pen, and began to write a letter, "No, I have to hurry and call all my partners from the theater over, I really want to see their surprised faces soon!"



Phyllis, however, stepped forward and held her hand, "Wait, Irene, don't you think... this story is too contrary to common sense?"



After listening to his wife, he too felt that the entire story was gripping, the portrayal of humanity’s good and evil, righteousness and wickedness was deeply touching, but the description of witches was completely contrary to what the Church claimed, and it was also too detailed — for example, the third lucky one, because of her family's love, could release her power without restraint, ultimately discovering that the demon's possession was nothing but a lie, and that witches, apart from controlling magic, were no different from ordinary people; they could laugh, they could cry, and they would be overwhelmed with grief upon the death of loved ones. Wasn't Prince Roland afraid that once the news got out, the Church would come knocking?



"Contrary to common sense? No... Phyllis, before becoming witches, they were ordinary people, right?"



"Uh, yes, that's correct."



"What about me then?" Irene's eyes widened, "If I became a witch, would you think of me as a minion of evil?"



"No, of course not," Phyllis hurriedly said, "You will always be the kind girl I know."



"And what if we had a daughter, and she became a witch?"



"That's even more impossible—" He suddenly closed his mouth, already understanding his wife's point. Judging witches from an outsider's perspective was completely different from branding one's own loved ones as evil.



"Yes," Irene nodded with satisfaction. "If we really do have a witch..."

"I will cherish her just like the father of the third witch in the story," the knight knelt on one knee, posing as if swearing allegiance.

"That is the correct answer," she put down her quill, laughing softly, "I think... we can give it a try right now."

"As you wish, my dear," he whispered in her ear, then scooped her up in his arms and headed for the bedroom.
