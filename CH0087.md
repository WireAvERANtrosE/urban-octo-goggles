## Twilight of Winter (Part 1)
"Prepare—! Stab!"

Tanner thrust out the spear in his hands with all his might, then his hands shook violently, and the shaft of the spear made a cracking sound. A demonic beast, a wolf kind, was impaled on the tip of the spear. Its fur was bristling, its blood-red eyes wide open like copper bells, and its mouth, revealing two rows of sharp teeth, with the largest comparable to his own thumb. This was the first time he had come into such close contact with a demonic beast. The beast swung its claws in the air, and snowflakes even splashed onto his face.



Tanner's mind went blank, and almost instinctively, as per the training he had accumulated, he gripped the spear shaft tighter and continued to exert force forward. A single breath seemed to stretch into eternity. He saw the spear shaft bend to its limits, the spearhead deeply embedded in the demonic beast's belly, and he even thought that in the next moment, those sharp claws would tear open his own cheek.



With a "snap," the spear shaft could no longer withstand the wolf kind's force and finally broke into two pieces. It was this crisp sound that made time flow normally again. The beast fell downwards, just as it came—its claws landed on the parapet, scraping out a series of fragments, carrying that broken half of the spear, and heavily smashed down to the ground along the city wall.



"The gun squad, loaded!"

"Fire at will!"



Two gun barrels immediately extended beside Tanner. He quickly stepped back half a step, raised his head to avoid the gunpowder debris and gases rushing to his eyes. As for his ears, he had no time to care about them.



The guns fired quickly, and Tanner approached the parapet again, only to find a variety of demonic beasts lying at the bottom of the wall. Someone nudged him, and he turned his head to see his roommate grinning smugly at him.



Having only touched the gun for a little over a week, what's there to be smug about. Tanner glared back and then returned his gaze to the battlefield. When His Highness's artillery team comes into play, you'll realize that the iron tube in your hand is nothing more than a walking stick.



"Gun Leader, your weapon—take it." Moe handed over a new wooden gun, "Have these demonic beasts gone mad? Has it been two or three hours already?"



"They are mad to begin with," Tanner set up his gun, waiting for the next wave of the enemy's attack, "What time is it now?"



"It's almost noon." Moe exhaled, and while the hunter wasn't looking, he quickly glanced around, "Where's Jop? And the Rodney brothers?"



"Don't take your eyes off the front, do you want to be gutted by a wolf-type?" Tanner said irritably, "They've been assigned to other sections of the wall, maybe in the third or fourth group. Speaking of which, how did you end up in the first group?"



"I'm from the reserve team," he chuckled, "I go wherever I'm needed. Just now an old man got injured, and it was my turn to replace him—"



"Prepare—!" The voice of the hunter observer rang out, interrupting Moe's words. Tanner saw about a dozen demonic beasts rapidly approaching. He could now quickly distinguish the types of demonic beasts; this wave only had two wolf-types, the rest were boar-types, fox-types, and one bear-type, not much of a threat to the wall.



"Stab!" Nevertheless, he followed the command, extending the spear with his teammates in unison. As expected, the spearhead met empty air this time, and he retracted the spear, catching a glimpse from the corner of his eye of a wolf-type being taken down by other members of the first group. By the time the slower demonic beasts also gathered at the base of the wall, the musket team squeezed in beside him, firing freely downwards.



This repetitive motion had been going on since dawn. When the initial horn was blown, most people were still in their dreams. Tanner yawned; this time, the demonic beasts' attack was more intense than ever before, usually only lasting one or two waves, but it was still ongoing, with the corpses of the demonic beasts almost piling up under the wall. Midway through, they had already been replaced once by the second militia team, they ate something hastily, rested for a moment, and then went back up the wall.



Unexpectedly, Tanner found himself calmer than he had imagined. Hearing the command to stab and retract the spear, leaving the rest to the musket team, was just like the drills they practiced on any other day. The somewhat baffling regulations and action requirements at first, at this moment, all came into play, and were unbelievably effective.



The others were much like Tanner himself—although they gripped their musket barrels tightly and looked quite serious, some of the reserves were visibly nervous. Yet everyone stood straight, and not a single person took a step back.



However, Tanner understood that their greatest confidence didn't come from the daily practice, but from His Highness. Tanner only stole a glance at the central watchtower of the city wall after the gun squad had fired—that was where Prince Roland stood.



From the moment the horn sounded, His Highness arrived at the city wall and stood on the same line of defense as everyone else, without taking a rest since. Even when Tanner rotated out for food, Prince Roland remained at the top of the watchtower, with breakfast having been delivered personally by the Chief Knight.



Recalling the previous lord, who would always leave early by boat during the Evil Months each year, followed by the nobles, and then at last the commoners. Those with spare money could pay a few Silver Royals to leave by boat, while those without had to rely on their own feet to reach Longsong Stronghold. Just thinking about this filled him with strength.



Indeed, they belonged to Prince Roland of Greycastle's army, entirely different from the patrol team of Border Town before. That bunch, relying on their armor and weapons, often acted tyrannically in the old and new districts, even extorting foreign merchants. In Tanner's view, aside from the two captains of the patrol team, the others were no different from thugs. But the militia was a powerful force; under the leadership of Prince Roland, they could even keep the terrifying demonic beasts at bay outside the town, never allowing them to advance a step further—something that previously only Longsong Stronghold could achieve.



Look at Fish Ball, the notorious coward from the old district, often the butt of jokes, who after joining the militia Second Team, now handled the long spear with proper form. And there was Femi, huge in stature but always a beat slow, the subject of amusement in the old district. Now, his spear thrusting motions were fast and fierce, more skilled than most. Tanner knew that after others finished training, he would practice a hundred more times, all because His Highness had personally told him, "The less agile a bird is, the earlier it must fly to catch up with the others, and eventually surpass them."



Why was it that, despite initially joining just for those two eggs, he now felt fortunate to be part of the militia? Small changes every day, always progressing further than yesterday. Tanner believed that not just him, but everyone felt this. He didn't know how to describe his own feelings; perhaps, it could be summed up with what His Highness often said during training—they were a team unlike any other of this era.



"Wu—Wu—" Two short horn blasts jolted Tanner to attention, a warning of the appearance of a mixed demonic beast. He looked into the distance; it was another lion-headed, winged mixed beast, very similar to the one that had previously broken into the city. This was the second one they encountered today, he thought, but this time was different. Besides the gun squad, they had other help.



Tanner tilted his head slightly, and in his peripheral vision, a little girl with golden short hair beside His Highness was already levitating.
