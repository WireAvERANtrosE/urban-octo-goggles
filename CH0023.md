## Source of Power
"Come, try to fuse these two iron plates together," Roland said.



Anna extended her finger, pressing it on the seam of the iron plate. Flames shot out from between her fingers, visibly melting the joint at a speed visible to the naked eye.



"Reduce the intensity of the flame and do it again from the backside."



She nodded and repeated the process. The two iron plates were joined at a 90-degree angle and were firmly welded together.



Roland carefully inspected the joint and found the result to be exactly as he had imagined—a flawless weld without any imperfections. With a bit of polishing to remove the traces of molten iron, the two iron plates would be nearly indistinguishable from a forged piece made in one go.



"Very good, Miss Anna, that's simply amazing," Roland couldn't help but exclaim, "Next, let's attach the other two iron plates as well."



"Is this a... bucket made of iron?"



"No, this is a cylinder," he corrected.



"Cylinder?" Anna repeated, puzzled.



"Yes, it can be used to fill the air," Roland pointed at another square iron plate, "See the small hole on it? The air enters the cylinder through this small hole, pushing the piston—uh, the piston is an iron plate slightly smaller than the inner diameter of the cylinder, which can move freely inside the cylinder."



Even Anna, faced with so many newly coined terms, felt her head spinning, "So these... cylinders, pistons and the like, what are they for?"



"They're for creating a machine that can move automatically."



The steam engine, which brought about the first Industrial Revolution needed by humanity, completely liberated human and animal power.



Its schematic is something any mechanical aficionado would be familiar with—it's essentially an enlarged version of a boiling kettle. The steam from boiling water is directed into the cylinder, pushing the piston and connecting rod, converting thermal energy into mechanical energy.



The principle is exceptionally simple, but that does not mean it is easy to manufacture. The difficulty lies in the airtightness between the cylinder and the piston, as well as in the manufacturing of the steam pipe. When metalworking skills were not yet advanced, attempting to forge a qualified cylinder by hand was nothing short of a fantasy.



However, Anna's abilities perfectly compensated for these technological shortcomings.



Roland only needed to design four iron plates of the same size in advance, have the blacksmith cast, forge, and polish them, then use a right angle plate to fix the shape, and Anna could weld them together, resulting in a highly rigid square cylinder. With the help of the witch, there was no need to follow the traditional process of making a cannon barrel boring machine before machining a round cylinder. Other major components could also be made in smaller pieces and then assembled. In this way, even a small workshop like a blacksmith's shop could work together to produce all the parts needed for a steam engine.



In fact, before the invention of welding, people could only connect small parts with bolts or rivets, and the inside of the cylinder had to be smooth, which conventional connections obviously could not achieve.



The only tricky part was the steam pipe. Its manufacturing method was nothing special; a long iron plate was heated until red-hot, then placed into a groove-shaped mold, and hammered into shape, one blow at a time. This was also the method used to make the barrels of front-loading flintlock rifles. The only difference was that rifle barrels needed to be straightened afterwards, reamed, and rifled, which made the process a bit more complicated.



The trouble was that Roland could not possibly summon a blacksmith to his own backyard, and the witches had to remain hidden for the time being. Since blacksmithing was not exactly his forte, he had no choice but to have his Chief Knight, Carter, do the work, while he directed from the side.



After three days of hard work, Roland finally assembled the first steam engine in the backyard.



"Is this the contraption you claimed has immense power?" Carter frowned as he examined the strange machine. He was certain that it had nothing to do with the rituals of a demonic cult. He had personally fitted every single piece of iron onto it, and it looked like a sealed furnace. If devils were attracted to this, it would be truly illogical.



But how could a pile of iron start moving? It looked very clumsy, and it had no legs; could it possibly fly?



However, in Roland's eyes, this seemingly rudimentary machine radiated the beauty of industry. Standing on the shoulders of giants, he naturally did not follow the path of Newcomen's steam engine—Watt's steam engine—improved steam engines. His first prototype was a high-pressure steam engine with double connecting rods and a sliding valve. Its production was not much more difficult than the most primitive steam engine; the key lay in some innovative thinking.



"You'll see in a moment."



Roland poured a bucket of water into the steam chamber and asked Anna to light the firewood.



Ten minutes later, the water boiled and began to tumble. Soon, there was a crackling sound from within the cylinder. Roland knew it was the sound of the cylinder body expanding from the heat. The piston was made of thinner iron and would expand and deform more than the cylinder body, eventually fitting tightly against the cylinder wall.



"This isn't just boiling water, huh? I didn't expect it to actually be a stove." Carter muttered.



When the cylinder was filled with steam, a scene that greatly excited Roland occurred. The piston began to push the connecting rod outward, and when it reached the apex, another connecting rod pulled the slide valve, and the steam pushed the piston inward again. The two connecting rods moved back and forth, spinning the wheel rapidly, and as the fire increased, the speed quickly peaked.



The machine emitted a piercing roar, and the exhaust port puffed out white steam, exuding an unstoppable momentum.



"Is this what you were talking about... the power hidden within nature?" Anna asked blankly.



The Chief Knight's face was filled with disbelief; he had gone to great lengths to install the final large iron wheel, and now it was spinning swiftly as if it were as light as a feather. Standing beside it, one could even feel the airflow stirred up by the wheel hitting their face—this could only mean that the strength of this iron contraption was astonishingly great.



A sense of unease gradually rose in his heart.



His Highness said it could replace human and animal power; if he wasn't deceiving himself, when it replaced horses to pull chariots, with just this brute force, perhaps ten knights would struggle to withstand it.



Training a qualified knight takes fifteen years, yet manufacturing such an iron stove only requires three days. Even including the time for the blacksmiths to forge the parts, it's no more than a week.



It doesn't need feeding, isn't afraid of cold or hunger, and doesn't fear arrows and swords. Just mount a ram on the front, and it could charge unimpeded on the battlefield.



With this in mind... is there still a need for traditional knights to exist?

...

In the evening, when Roland returned to his bedroom, he once again encountered Nightingale.

This time she was not wearing her hood, sitting beside the table with a smile on her face, toying with several pieces of parchment, "It seems that the rumors outside can't be believed. They say that the fourth prince is ignorant and of bad character, but in reality, you are hardly inferior to a court master. Is this drawing on the paper the design of that iron furnace? You call it... a steam engine, right?"



Damn, can't a person have a little privacy? Come and go as you please, do you think this is your own house? Roland complained inwardly, but outwardly he replied as if nothing was amiss, "It is the design, but without Anna's help, it would just be a piece of paper."



"What can it do?"



"A lot—hauling ore, draining water, smelting iron, forging; anywhere that requires great effort, it can be of use."



"Then I'll take it," Nightingale rolled up the parchment and tucked it into her cloak, "We also have someone who can manipulate flames."



"Hey—"



She waved her hand to stop Roland's protest, "Of course, I'm not taking your things for nothing. Take a look at this first." She placed a small wad of white material on the table.



Roland walked over and pinched it with his fingers, only to discover that it was a roll of paper.



He gently unfolded it and glanced over it, "This is..."



"A secret message carried by a carrier pigeon," Nightingale said with a teasing tone. "The recipient is your head maid, Tyra. Tsk, tsk, it seems that your harem is not very stable."



"I have never touched her," Roland said with a frown.



Tyra, he remembered that this woman had been with him for quite some time. Originally, the fourth prince had taken quite an interest in her but failed to take advantage of her despite several harassments. This time, when he came to Border Town, he simply promoted her to head maid to serve him closely, and her room was arranged next door. Could it be that she was a spy arranged by his siblings?



Although the letter was unsigned, judging by the content, it was almost certainly penned by one of them. The letter mentioned that the last failure had greatly displeased their master and that they must act during the disturbance at Longsong Stronghold next time, not allowing for another failure. Well, actually, you've already succeeded, he thought, otherwise, he would not have become Roland Wimbledon.



This letter was unlikely to be forged by Nightingale, for only those involved in the conspiracy would clearly know about the first assassination attempt. And if Nightingale wanted to kill him, she wouldn't need to go through such trouble.



"Did you steal this from her?"



"Your head maid is not that foolish; she intended to burn it after reading. Unfortunately for her, I was right behind her at the time," she made a gesture of switching things out, "So, what do you plan to do? Do you need my help to 'deal with' it?"



Roland naturally understood what she meant by dealing with it. After a moment of hesitation, he finally nodded, "I'll leave it to you." He really had no confidence in handling such matters himself, "If possible... ask her who's behind her."



"As you wish, Your Highness," Nightingale said with a smile, bending over to curtsy, "Then, this scroll will be my reward."
