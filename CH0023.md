## Source of Power
"Come, try to join these two iron plates together," Roland said.

Anna extended her fingers, pressing them on the seam of the iron plates. Flames spurted from between her fingers, visibly melting the joint at a rapid speed.

"Lower the heat, and do the same on the other side."

She nodded and did as instructed. The two iron plates were joined at a 90-degree angle, firmly welded together.

Roland carefully inspected the joint and found the result to be just as he had imagined--a flawless, perfect weld. If it was polished a bit to remove the traces of molten iron, the two plates would appear no different from a single forged piece.

"Excellent, Miss Anna, simply splendid," Roland could not help but exclaim, "Next, we will join the other two iron plates as well."

"Is this... a bucket made of iron?"

"No, it's a cylinder," he corrected.

"A cylinder?" Anna repeated, puzzled.



"Yes, it can be used to hold air," Roland pointed to another square iron plate, "See the small hole on it? The air enters the cylinder from this hole, driving the piston—uh, the piston is a piece of iron slightly smaller than the inner diameter of the cylinder, which can move freely inside."



Even Anna was dizzy with so many new words, "So what are these... cylinders, pistons for?"



"To build a machine that can move automatically."



The steam engine, which brought the power needed for the first industrial revolution of mankind, completely liberated human and animal labor.



Its schematic is known to every mechanical dog, simply put, it's a magnified version of a boiling kettle. The boiling steam is directed into the cylinder, driving the piston and connecting rod, converting thermal energy into mechanical energy.



The principle is simple, but that doesn't mean it's easy to make. The difficulty lies in the sealing of the cylinder and piston, as well as the manufacture of the air pipe. When metalworking skills were not enough, it was a pipe dream to forge a qualified cylinder by hand.



However, Anna's ability perfectly compensated for the shortcomings in craftsmanship.



Roland only needed to design four iron plates of the same size in advance, let the blacksmith forge and polish them, then use the right angle plate to fix the shape, and then let Anna weld them, he could get a square cylinder with high rigidity. With the help of the witch, he didn't have to follow the traditional process of manufacturing a cannon barrel boring machine first, and then making a round cylinder. The same was true for other large parts, which could be made into small pieces and then assembled. In this way, even a small workshop like a blacksmith shop could jointly manufacture all the parts needed for a steam engine.



In fact, before welding was invented, people could only connect small parts with bolts or rivets, and the inside of the cylinder had to be smooth, which conventional connections obviously couldn't achieve.



The only troublesome part was the gas pipeline. The method of making it was not particularly special, heat a long iron plate until it is red hot, then place it into a groove-type mold, and hammer it into shape. This was also the method of making the barrel of a muzzle-loading flintlock gun. However, the gun barrel also needed to be straightened afterwards, reamed, and so on, which was somewhat more complex.



The problem was, Roland couldn't possibly call the blacksmith to his own backyard, the witches couldn't be exposed yet, and blacksmithing was not his forte. In desperation, he could only let the Chief Knight do the work, while he himself commanded from the side.



After fussing about for three days, Roland finally assembled the first steam engine in his backyard.



"So this is your so-called infinitely powerful gadget?" Carter frowned as he looked at this strange machine. He was certain that this thing had nothing to do with the cult rituals. Every single iron bump on it was installed by him personally, it looked just like a sealed stove. If a devil could be attracted by it, that would be too unreasonable.



But how was a pile of iron bumps supposed to move? It looked very clumsy and didn't have feet, could it possibly fly?



But in Roland's eyes, this seemingly crude machine exuded the beauty of industry. Standing on the shoulders of giants, he naturally didn't follow the route of Newcomen steam engine—Watt steam engine—improved steam engine, his first prototype was already a high-pressure steam engine with double connecting rods and slide valves. Its production was not much harder than the most primitive steam engine, the key was some innovative thinking.



"You'll see in a moment." 



Roland poured a bucket of water into the steam room and let Anna light the firewood.



Ten minutes later, the water was boiling, rumbling and rolling. Soon, there was a crackling sound from the cylinder, Roland knew that it was the sound of the cylinder body expanding due to heat. The piston's iron plate was thinner, and its expansion and deformation would be greater than that of the cylinder body, eventually firmly pressing against the cylinder wall.



"Isn't this just boiling water? I didn't expect it to actually be a stove," Carter muttered. 

When the cylinder was filled with steam, a scene that excited Roland greatly unfolded. The piston began to drive the connecting rod outward. When it reached the peak of movement, another rod pulled the sliding valve, and the steam pushed the piston back in. The two rods moved back and forth, causing the wheel to spin rapidly. As the fire power increased, the speed quickly reached its peak.

The machine let out a piercing roar, and the exhaust port was huffing white steam, showing an unstoppable momentum. 

"Is this the...power hidden in nature that you spoke of?" Anna asked blankly. 

The chief knight had an incredulous look on his face. The final large iron wheel had taken a lot of effort to install, but now it was spinning as fast as a feather. Standing next to it, one could even feel the airflow stirred up by the wheel - this could only mean that the iron lump in front of him had an astonishing amount of power. 

A sense of unease gradually rose in his heart. 

The prince said it could replace manpower and animal power. If he wasn't lying, when it replaced horses to pull the chariot, just this brute force alone would be hard for ten knights to resist. 

To train a qualified knight, it would take fifteen years, but to build such an iron stove, it would only take three days. Including the time for the blacksmith to make the parts, it would only take a week.

It didn't need feeding, wasn't afraid of cold or hunger, and wasn't afraid of arrows and spears. As long as a ram was installed in front of it, it could charge across the battlefield.



In that case... is there still a need for traditional knights?

...

In the evening, when Roland returned to his bedroom, he saw Nightingale again.

This time, she was not wearing a hood. She sat by the table with a smile on her face, fiddling with a few pieces of parchment. "It seems the rumors outside can't be trusted. They say the fourth prince is uneducated and has a bad temperament, but in reality, he is no less than a court master. Is this a design for that iron stove you call... a steam engine, right?" 

Damn it, can't she respect one's privacy? She comes and goes as she pleases, does she think this is her home? Roland thought to himself, but on the surface, he replied casually, "Yes, it's a design. But without Anna's help, it's just a piece of paper."

"What can it do?"

"A lot. Mining, draining, smelting, forging, anywhere that requires a lot of force, it can be used."

"Then I'll take it," Nightingale rolls up the parchment and puts it into her robe, "There are also people in the Witch Cooperation Association who can control fire."

"Hey—"



She waved her hand, stopping Roland's protest. "Of course, I'm not just taking your things for nothing. Look at this first." She placed a small white object on the table. 



Roland walked over, pinched it with his fingers, and discovered that it was a rolled-up piece of paper. 



He gently unfolded it, glanced at it, and said, "This is..."



"A secret message delivered by a carrier pigeon," Nightingale said in a teasing tone. "The recipient is your head maid, Tyra. Tsk, tsk, it seems your harem is not so stable."



"I never touched her," Roland frowned. 



Tyra, he seemed to remember that this woman had been with him for a very long time. The former Fourth Prince had been quite interested in her, but his attempts to harass her had always been thwarted. This time, when he came to Border Town, he simply promoted her to head maid to serve him personally, and arranged for her room to be next door. Could it be that she was a spy arranged by his royal siblings?



Even though this letter was unsigned, judging from the content, it was very likely written by one of his royal siblings. The letter said that the master was very displeased with the failure last time, and next time, they must take action during the chaos at Longsong Fortress, and must not fail again. Well, you've already succeeded, he thought, otherwise he wouldn't have become Roland Wimbledon.



This letter was unlikely to be a forgery by Nightingale, because only those involved in the conspiracy would have a clear understanding of the first assassination plan. And if Nightingale wanted to kill him, there was no need to go to such trouble.



"Did you steal this from her?" he asked.



"Your chief maid isn't so foolish, she planned to burn it after reading. It's just a pity that I happened to be behind her when she was reading it," she made a gesture of swapping, "So, what do you plan to do? Do you need my help 'dealing' with it?"

Roland naturally understood what she meant by 'dealing'. After hesitating for a moment, he finally nodded, "I appreciate your help." He really didn't have the confidence to handle this matter himself, "If possible... ask for me, who is behind her."

"As you wish, Your Highness," Nightingale said with a smile and a bow, "Then, this blueprint is my reward."
