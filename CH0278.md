## Battle Plan
The conflict ended swiftly.

Upon seeing the imposing knight, nobody dared to say another word. In fact, most of the actors were fence-sitters to begin with, or else there wouldn't have been a dispute at the start. Faced with the renowned May, not everyone had the courage to stand up against her, and now the situation had become completely one-sided as Bella was taken out of the lounge by two men.

Soon, the large room was left with only Carter and the members of the town's drama troupe.

"Thank you so much for your help," Gait and the others bowed in gratitude.

"You are really... amazing! In just a few moments, you had her at a loss for words," Irene exclaimed as she grasped May's hand, "And that slap, you practically knocked her silly!"

Then she turned and curtsied to the Chief Knight, "Sir Carter, what brings you to Longsong Stronghold?"

"I'm curious about that myself," May shrugged, feeling relieved.

"By His Highness's orders," Carter said, spreading his hands, "May I invite you for a drink?"



"Is this... where you live?" The Chief Knight looked around somewhat uneasily.



"Yeah, pretty ordinary, right?" May took out a bottle of white liquor from the cupboard and poured him a small shallow cup. "The tavern only opens at night, so consider this drink on me." Irene and her group slipped away pretty fast, each one of them suddenly remembering they had something to do when they were on the road. In the end, when she returned to her residence, only she and Carter were left.



"Indeed... pretty ordinary," Carter coughed twice and said, "I wonder about your family..."



"My mother passed away quite early, and I've found a job for my father at the theater doing some light, miscellaneous work," May said calmly, "but I think he won't be back until late at night."



This small flat located in a deep alley of the inner city district was what she bought with all her savings after becoming the Star of the Western Region. Although the house was small and old, moving away from the outer city district at least allowed her to avoid harassment and malicious scrutiny.



"Uh... sorry."



"It's nothing," May also poured herself a small cup, "Did His Highness send you here to sort out the theater's order and resolve disputes among the actors?"



"No, of course not," Carter waved his hands repeatedly, "Timothy has sent people to cause trouble for the Western Region again, and Prince Roland is on his way here with the main force. I just arrived ahead on the 'Littletown' to arrange for the Second Army to strengthen the night guard, and incidentally to ask the Honeysuckle family to be on alert to prevent anyone from sneaking attacks on the city gates or the like."



"You shouldn't be telling me these things." May was taken aback, then shook her head.



"You asked, and it's not any kind of secret operation," Carter downed the drink in one gulp, "don't worry, I know my limits."

"Alright," she pouted, "so how did you end up in the theater?"

"After I handed over my tasks, I suddenly saw the promotion for the play you were in and wanted to see what you would be like on a real theater stage. It turned out just as I imagined—even though I only caught the ending, your performance was truly spectacular," the knight exclaimed in admiration. "So I went backstage to ask you for a drink, but I didn't know if I should go in and I lingered at the door until I heard the argument inside..."

"You were outside already?" May frowned.

"I didn't mean to eavesdrop," Carter raised his hands, "it was just an accident, I promise."

"Pfft," she couldn't help but laugh lightly, "I'm not blaming you, no need to look like that."

"Really?" The knight breathed a sigh of relief and reached for the drink, but she slapped his hand away.

"You have a mission tonight, right?" May shook her finger, "So you can only have a small cup, no more. However..." she said with a slight smile, "after this mission is over, you can treat me properly."

After Carter left, May poured herself another glass of wine, leaned back in her chair, and sipped slowly.



Ever since she had tasted the white liquor last time, she found herself gradually growing fond of its fiery and mellow sensation.



She had already vaguely come to an answer regarding Carter's earlier invitation; some things indeed could only be understood after trying, just like the white liquor in her hand. Although it was hard to swallow at first, the rich aroma that followed was incomparable to the sweet and sour fruit wine or the bland barley beer.



Maybe after this theatrical performance ends, she should return to settle in the small town with her father?



...



Two days later, Roland arrived at Longsong Stronghold.



Peter Helmann and members of the five major families came out of the city to welcome His Highness Prince's entourage.



After the First Army was stationed in the stronghold, Roland went straight to the castle and held a brief meeting.



"I have reliable information that Timothy has dispatched a troop heading towards the stronghold," he said from the main seat in the stairway hall, looking down at the nobles below. "We still do not know their numbers or route, but there is no doubt they are coming for me. According to Timothy's usual methods, they will certainly expand their force by plundering civilians and then force these people to attack by drugging them."



"Your Highness," Viscount Eir of the Wolfheart family asked, puzzled, "the drug you mentioned is...?"



"A sinister red pill that allows commoners to gain strength greater than that of a knight. However, once the effect ends, the user can only struggle helplessly until death." Apart from Peter, the other four major families were unaware of the Church's secret medicine. Roland simply described its characteristics and origins, "Timothy plans to use this method to continuously weaken the resistance of the Western Region. Any population he cannot use is a target for plundering, and your territories are also on the list. As the Guardian of the Western Region, I demand that you move all family members and civilians within your territories into the city to prevent Timothy from expanding his troops."



"But what about the grain in our warehouses and the goods we have stored..."



"Move as much as you can," Roland said decisively, cutting him off, "I'm only giving you three days to gather the surrounding civilians into the stronghold. Once I repel Timothy's troops, you will naturally be allowed to leave."



After the meeting, the prince summoned Iron Axe into the castle.



In fact, he had not revealed the true situation he was aware of to the nobles—with the carpet-style reconnaissance of Lightning and Maggie, the troops from the capital had already exposed their whereabouts. Unlike the previous invaders, they were sailing westward along the main channel of the Redwater River on single-masted sailboats, planning to enter the hinterlands of the Western Region through Willow Town.



This was a very tricky route. Once the enemy passed the fork, they could either follow the tributary to circle back and attack the south and east gates of Longsong Stronghold or continue westward, heading straight for Border Town.



To avoid the dilemma of dividing forces and leaving one side vulnerable, he had to take the initiative to concentrate his superior forces and crush the enemy at one point.



Clearly, the fork in the Redwater River was the most appropriate place for an ambush.
