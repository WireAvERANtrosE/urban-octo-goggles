## Battle Plan
The conflict ended swiftly. 

Seeing the menacing knight approaching, no one dared to speak another word. Moreover, most of the actors were like grass on the top of a wall, which wouldn't have led to the initial dispute if they weren't. Not everyone had the courage to stand up against the renowned May, and now the situation had become one-sided, with Bella being taken out of the rest area by two men.

Before long, the large room was left with only Carter and the members of the town's theater troupe.

"Thank you very much for your help," Gatro and the others bowed in gratitude.

"You are really... so amazing! You forced her into silence in just two or three moves," Irene exclaimed, holding May's hand, "And that slap, it practically knocked her out!"

Then she turned and gave a bow to the Chief Knight, "Lord Carter, what brings you to Longsong Fortress?"

"I'm quite curious about that myself," May shrugged, feeling relieved inside.

"By His Highness's orders," Carter spread his hands, "May I buy you a drink?"

...



"Is this... where you live?" The Chief Knight looked around with a slight restraint.



"Yep, pretty ordinary, right?" May took out a bottle of white wine from the cabinet and poured him a small cup. "The tavern only operates at night, so consider this a treat from me." Irene and her group sure left quickly, each recalling suddenly that they had something to do. In the end, only she and Carter were left to return to the residence.



"Indeed... it's quite ordinary," Carter coughed twice and said, "I was wondering about your family..."



"My mother passed away a long time ago, and I found a job for my father at the theater, just some easy odd jobs," May said calmly, "But I think he won't be back until late at night."



This small flat located in the deep alleys of the inner city district was what she bought with all her savings after becoming the Star of the Western Region. Although the house was small and old, moving away from the outer city district at least spared her from harassment and the malicious prying of others.



"Uh... sorry."



"It's nothing," May also poured herself a small cup. "Did His Highness send you to rectify the order of the theater and resolve the disputes among the actors?"



"No, of course not," Carter waved his hands repeatedly, "Timothy has sent people to cause trouble in the Western Region again, and Prince Roland is on his way with the main force. I just arrived ahead on the small town ship to arrange for the Second Army to strengthen the night watch and incidentally to warn the Gold and Silver Flower family to be on alert, to prevent someone from attacking the city gates or the like."



"You shouldn't be telling me these things." May paused, then shook her head.



"You did ask, and it's not any kind of secret operation," Carter downed his drink in one gulp, "Don't worry, I know my limits."

"Alright," she pouted, "So how did you end up at the theater?"

"After I had given out my instructions, I happened to see a promotion for the play you were in and I wanted to see what you would look like on a real theater stage. It turned out just as I imagined—although I only caught the ending, your performance was truly spectacular," the knight praised. "So I went backstage to invite you for a drink, but I didn't know if I should go in and ended up lingering at the door until I heard the argument inside..."

"You were already outside?" May frowned.

"I didn't mean to eavesdrop," Carter raised his hands, "It was an accident, I swear."

"Pfft," she couldn't help but chuckle, "I'm not blaming you, you don't need to make that face."

"Really?" The knight sighed in relief and reached for the wine, only to have his hand slapped away.

"You have a mission tonight, right?" May wagged her finger, "So you can only have a little drink, no more. But..." she smiled slightly, "once this mission is over, you can treat me properly."

After Carter left, May poured herself another glass of wine, leaned back in her chair, and sipped it slowly.



Since tasting the Baijiu last time, she realized that she had gradually grown fond of its fiery and mellow sensation.

Regarding Carter's previous invitation, she had a vague answer in mind. Some things indeed could only be known after trying, just like the Baijiu in her hand. Although it was hard to swallow at first, the rich fragrance that followed could not be compared to the sweet and sour fruit wine or the insipid barley beer.

Perhaps after this drama tour is over, she should take her father back to settle in the town?

...

Roland arrived at Longsong Stronghold two days later.

Petrov Hull and members of the five major families came out of the city to welcome the prince's entourage.

After the First Army was stationed in the stronghold, Roland went straight to the castle and held a brief meeting.

"I have reliable information that Timothy has dispatched a troop heading towards the stronghold," he said, seated in the main seat of the stairway hall, looking down at the nobles below. "We do not yet know their numbers or route, but there is no doubt they are coming for me. According to Timothy's usual style, they will certainly expand their forces by looting civilians, then force these people to attack by using drugs."

"Your Highness," Viscount Erye of the Wolfheart Family asked, puzzled, "the drugs you mentioned are...?"



"A vile red pill that can grant commoners power greater than that of knights, but after the effects wear off, the user can only struggle helplessly in death," Roland explained briefly the characteristics and origins of the Church's secret medicine, as the other four major families, aside from Petrov, were unaware of it. "Timothy intends to use this method to continuously weaken the resistance in the Western Region. Any population he deems unnecessary is a target for his enslavement, and your territories are included. As the guardian of the Western Region, I demand that you move all your family members and civilians into the city to prevent them from adding to Timothy's forces."

"But what about the grain in our storehouses and the goods we have stored..."

"Take as much as you can," Roland interjected decisively, "I'm only giving you three days to gather the surrounding civilians into the fortress. Once I repel Timothy's troops, you will naturally be free to leave."



After the meeting, the prince summoned Iron Axe to the castle.



In fact, he had not revealed the true situation to the nobles—that with the carpet-style reconnaissance of Lightning and Maggie, the troops from the capital had already exposed their movements. Different from the previous invaders, they were traveling west along the main channel of the Redwater River on single-masted sailboats, planning to enter the heartland of the Western Region through Willow Town.



This was a very tricky route; once the enemy crossed the fork, they could either return along a tributary to attack the southern and eastern gates of Longsong Stronghold, or continue westward, heading straight for Border Town.



To avoid the dilemma of dividing his forces and being unable to defend effectively, he had to concentrate his superior forces to crush the enemy at one point.



Clearly, the fork in the Redwater River was the most suitable place for an ambush.
