## The Evil Beast First Appears
As Brian had said, once it started snowing in Border Town, it wouldn't stop. Overnight, the small town was draped in a layer of white. By early morning, the snow had lessened, with only a few scattered snowflakes falling from the sky, but the sky was still a murky grey. The idea that he wouldn’t see the sun for several months was somewhat unbelievable to Roland. 



This was simply illogical, he thought. Although it was strange to seek logic in a world where witches had magic powers, how could the demonic beasts affect the weather? It was a pity that he didn’t have a meteorological satellite to tell him about the current distribution of clouds in the world. 



Walking towards the western city wall, Carter couldn't help but sigh, "The town has become much quieter, some people left with the nobles." 



"That's good too, at least they won't be holding us back," Roland exhaled a cloud of white breath, "I've already arranged for Barov to conduct a population census this winter."



"What's that?" 



"It's a door-to-door survey, counting how many people have stayed, how many people are in each household, what their names are, what jobs they do, and then recording it all," Roland explained, "This way, whether it's mobilizing human resources during wartime, or distributing relief after the battle, we can implement it quickly and effectively." 



"Uh... human resources?" Carter blinked, then laughed, "Your Highness, you've really changed from before."



"Oh?"



"The you from before, even though you would occasionally say things I didn't understand and do inexplicable things, they were ultimately actions unbefitting of a prince. But now..." Carter paused for a moment, as if choosing his words carefully, "Whether it's the strange training regulations you set, or the novel test items brought from the Alchemy Workshop, the results have been surprisingly effective. Perhaps this is what my grandfather meant when he said that the extraordinary are extraordinary because they can always see what ordinary people overlook. I have a feeling that you might really be able to become the next king."

"Is that so." A warmth surged in Roland's heart. Was there anything more fulfilling than being acknowledged by his subordinates after striving? For a moment, he felt an invigorating strength in his limbs, and the gloomy sky didn't seem so annoying anymore.

As he walked up to the city wall, the militia was clearing the snow from the path. Seeing the prince appear, everyone bowed in respect.

He should teach them to salute, Roland thought, "How was the situation last night?"

"No traces of demonic beasts were found," Iron Axe answered, "Your Highness, based on past experiences, there is usually a relatively calm period after the first snowfall. During this time, the number of demonic beasts is not high, and those that mutate are usually weaker animals."

Roland nodded, "Then keep up the alert."

The area behind the city wall had been transformed into a barracks. When the alarm wasn't sounded, most people would rest in the camp to conserve their strength. The guards worked in shifts, and considering the low winter temperatures, each team would patrol for only two hours before being replaced.

These measures were all set by Roland. He had asked Brian and learned that Longsong Stronghold had no plans to resist the demonic beasts. The most unlucky new recruits would be sent to observe the movements of the demonic beasts, staying on the city wall for an entire day. As a result, laziness and desertions were common, and every winter, twenty to thirty people would be hanged for neglect of duty or breach of military orders.

As for what to do upon discovering traces of demonic beasts, it was a complete mess. There were no defined defense sectors, nor were responsibilities assigned to individuals. Considering the war standards of this era, Roland understood. The society greatly valued individual bravery, honor, and plundering, even knights would charge headlong into battle in moments of passion. It was better not to expect too much at this time.



After patrolling along the city wall, everything seemed to be going smoothly, but Roland found that he had overlooked one issue.

That was the guiding barricades.

These obstacles currently clearly directed the demonic beasts towards the middle of the city wall, but if what Brian said was correct, two to three months of accumulated snow would eventually bury all the barricades. By then, any point along the six-hundred-meter defense line could potentially become the route of the demonic beasts, and he simply didn't have enough manpower to cover such a wide range.

Sending people down to clear the snow was also unlikely to be feasible, as a few agile wolf-type demonic beasts would be enough to cause heavy losses to the team.

Perhaps they still had to rely on the power of witches.

For example, have Nightingale sneak out of the city with Anna, start a big fire to melt the snow, and then sneak back - just like when she smuggled Nana out of the Pine family's house.

Just then, the watchtower on the left side of the city wall called out.

"Look ahead!"

Roland and Carter looked in the direction he pointed, a small dark shadow crawled out from the snow and slowly moved towards the city wall.



"Your Highness, should we..." The hunter in charge of this section of defense asked, turning his head.

"Based on the previous drills, you should judge whether to sound the horn," Roland said, "In fact, you have more experience in this than I do."

He hesitated for a moment, then simply pulled the crossbow string taut and stood by the city wall to continue observing.

Roland nodded in satisfaction. So far, the order on the city wall was well maintained. He was uncertain, though, if they could still organize a rapid defense against a large-scale demonic beast attack on Border Town.

As the dark shadow gradually approached, about fifty meters from the city wall, Roland could clearly see the appearance of the demonic beast.

Was it a mutated fox?

Its fur was greyish-black, its eyes glowing red, and it was panting white breath as it reached the city wall.

"This fellow seems to have been recently infected, it's not a big threat," Iron Axe said, drawing his bow and aiming.

"Do you say these creatures were infected by the breath of hell and driven west to this place?"



"Not only to the west," Carter added, "Whenever the Gates of Hell open in the Wilderness, areas without the blockage of the Impassable Mountain Range are attacked by demonic beasts, especially the vast gap in the north. The continuous Impassable Mountain Range appears as if it has been cut off, with the gap stretching over ten miles. It's the main direction of the demonic beasts' attacks."

The agitated beast paced below the city wall for a moment, raising its head, it growled at the people on the wall, ready to pounce. Iron Axe released the bowstring, and an arrow accurately pierced its neck, firmly pinning it to the ground. 

Roland noticed that the blood it spilled was black.

Why, when corrupted by the same demonic power, can witches retain their sanity after awakening, while beasts become frenzied and undergo physical changes? If there is a chance in the future, he thought, I must go and see what lies beyond the Impassable Mountain Range. In the prince's memory, that place was a forbidden area where humans could not tread, the site where the Gates of Hell opened. However, since no one had ever been there, these rumors inferred mostly from ancient books could not be verified, and their credibility was doubtful.
