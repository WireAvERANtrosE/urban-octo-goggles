## Beast of Evil Emerges
Just as Iron Axe had said, once it started snowing in Border Town, it would not stop.

In one night, the town was wrapped in a layer of white gauze. By morning, the snowfall had weakened, and only occasionally a few fragmented snowflakes would fall from the gray, overcast sky. The thought of not seeing the sun for several months seemed quite unbelievable to Roland.

It simply defied common sense, he thought, although looking for common sense in a world where witches possessed magical powers was weird in itself. But how did demonic beasts influence the weather? Unfortunately, he didn't have weather satellites to tell him the current distribution of clouds around the world.

Walking on the road to the West Wall, Carter couldn't help but sigh, "The town has gotten a lot quieter, still, a bunch of folks followed the nobles and evacuated."

"That's for the best, at least they won't hold us back," Roland exhaled a white breath, "I have arranged for Barov to conduct a census this winter."

"What's that?"

"It means going door to door to collect statistics, seeing how many people have stayed, how many people are in each household, what their names are, what jobs they do, and then recording it all," Roland explained, "This way, whether it's wartime manpower allocation or post-war relief distribution, it can be implemented quickly and effectively."

"Uh... manpower resources?" Carter blinked, then laughed, "Your Highness, you really have changed a lot from before."

"Oh?"



"Previously, Your Highness, although you would sometimes speak in terms I couldn't understand and do things that seemed inexplicable, they were ultimately actions unbecoming of a prince. But now..." Carter paused for a moment, seemingly considering his words, "Whether it's the bizarre training regulations you've set, or the novel experimental products moved from the Alchemy Workshop, the results have been surprisingly effective. Perhaps this is what my grandfather meant when he said that what makes the extraordinary extraordinary is their ability to see what ordinary people overlook. I have a feeling that you might truly become the next king."

"...Is that so." A warm current surged in Roland's heart. Was there anything more fulfilling than being acknowledged by his subordinates after all the hard work? For a moment, he felt energized, and even the dreary sky didn't seem so bothersome anymore.



As he walked atop the city wall, the militia was clearing the accumulated snow from the pathway. Upon seeing the prince, everyone bowed in salute.



He should teach them how to salute military-style, Roland thought. "How was the situation last night?"



"No traces of demonic beasts were found," Iron Axe replied. "Your Highness, based on past experience, after the first snowfall, we usually have a relatively stable period. During this time, there are fewer demonic beasts, and most of the mutated ones are weaker animals."



Roland nodded. "Then let's continue to remain vigilant."



The area behind the city wall had been transformed into barracks. Unless an alarm was sounded, most people would rest in the camp to conserve energy. The watch was conducted on a rotation system, and considering the low temperatures in winter, each team only patrolled for two hours before being replaced.



These measures were all laid down by Roland one by one. He had inquired with Barov and learned that Longsong Stronghold had no plan whatsoever for resisting demonic beasts. The unluckiest recruits were sent to monitor the movements of the demonic beasts, staying on the wall for an entire day. Therefore, instances of shirking duty and desertion occurred frequently, and as many as twenty or thirty people were hanged over the course of a winter for dereliction of duty or violating military orders.



As for what to do upon discovering traces of demonic beasts, it was even more of a mess. There was no division of defense sectors, nor was there an assignment of responsibility to individuals. Considering the level of warfare in this era, Roland came to understand. In an age that excessively valued personal bravery, emphasized honor and looting, and where even knights would charge into battle on a whim, it was better not to expect too much.



Patrolling along the city wall, everything seemed to be going smoothly so far, but Roland had realized that he had overlooked an issue.

That was the guidance barricades.

These obstacles were currently still clearly directing the demonic beasts towards the middle part of the city wall, but if Barov was right, two to three months of snow accumulation would eventually level the barricades completely. At that point, any spot along the six hundred meters of defense line might become a path for the demonic beasts, and his manpower simply could not attend to such a large area.

It was hardly possible to send people down to clear the snow, as a few agile wolf-type demonic beasts could cause heavy casualties to the team.

Perhaps they would still have to rely on the witches' powers.

For instance, by having Nightingale take Anna to sneak out of the city, light a big fire to melt the snow, and then sneak back inâ€”just like when she stealthily brought Nana from the Pine family.

Just then, the lookout post on the left side of the city wall shouted.

"Look ahead!"

Roland and Carter looked towards the direction he was pointing, and a small dark shadow crawled out from the snow, slowly moving towards the city wall.



"Your Highness, should we..." the hunter in charge of that section of the defense asked, turning his head.



"According to the previous drills, you should make your own judgment on whether to sound the horn," Roland said. "Moreover, in this respect, you have more experience than I do."



He hesitated for a moment but eventually just cocked the crossbow and stood by the wall to continue observing.



Roland nodded in satisfaction. For now, the order atop the wall was still maintained well. It was just uncertain whether they could quickly organize a defense following the drill procedures when a large number of demonic beasts attacked Border Town.



The dark shadow gradually approached, and when it was about fifty meters from the wall, Roland could clearly see the appearance of the demonic beast.



Was it a fox variant?



Its fur was a dark gray color, its eyes blood-red, and it panted white breath as it arrived at the wall.



"This guy looks like it's only been corrupted for a short time; it's not very threatening," Iron Axe said as he drew his bow and aimed.



"Do you say they have all been infected by the aura of hell and driven westward to this place?"



"Not just to the west," Carter leaned in and said, "When the Gate of Hell opens in the Barbarian Land, every place unprotected by the Impassable Mountain Range will be attacked by demonic beasts, especially the Great Rift to the north. The Impassable Mountain Range extends to this point and is cut off abruptly, with the rift spanning more than ten miles. It is also the main direction of the demonic beasts' assaults."



The frenzied monster paced back and forth under the city walls for a moment, then raised its head, bared its teeth, and let out a low growl at the people on the wall. Just as it was about to leap, Iron Axe released the bowstring, and an arrow accurately pierced its neck, nailing it firmly to the ground.



Roland noticed that the blood that flowed out was black.



Why is it that, despite both being corrupted by the power of the demons, witches can retain their sanity after awakening while beasts become frenzied and undergo physical mutations? If he ever got the chance, he would definitely go and take a look behind the Impassable Mountain Range, he thought. In the prince's memory, that place was a forbidden land untrodden by humans, where the Gate of Hell opened. However, since no one had ever been there, these rumors, mostly conjectured from ancient texts, could not be verified and their credibility was questionable.
