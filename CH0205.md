After repelling Timothy's forces, the town once again found peace.



Roland selected three people from the Ministry of Education in the City Hall and added two teachers to form a team, taking the books copied by Soraya to the Longsong Stronghold. Regardless of the outcome, he had finally taken the first step in assimilating the stronghold.



Peter might not be good at commanding battles, but he was indeed outstanding in administration. Within just a week, two thousand laborers recruited for road construction arrived in the town under the escort of knights. If not for the second batch of ten groups of kilns being put into production, Roland would not have dared to decide to build a paved road between the two places. Now, he finally had the opportunity to splurge.



This road was named the King's Avenue by Roland, and the Minister of Construction, Karl, was in full charge of it. Its structure was exactly the same as the streets in town, consisting of a cement-stabilized crushed stone layer. In an era without heavy vehicles, such a road surface was already sufficient for transportation tasks. Moreover, it had good drainage performance, and asphalt or concrete could be laid in the future as needed.



In terms of construction materials, four steam-driven mills had replaced manual labor to carry out the work of crushing stones, producing dozens of tons of crushed stone daily. The weak capacity for transportation limited further increase in output; it took over a hundred people and horse-drawn carts a full day to transport all these stones to the construction site, whereas in later generations, a single dump truck could have done the job.



Apart from the four kilns that maintained the firing of clay bricks, the rest of the blast furnaces had been put into the production of cement powder. After numerous composition trials and a supply of iron powder from the mines, the cement produced by the town now far surpassed the quality and stability of the initial batch.



However, the large-scale transportation of crushed stone and cement powder also brought some negative impacts to the town, with dust pollution being the most serious. By the afternoon, with just a slight breeze, one could see dense clouds of dust drifting in the sky, and the streets turned a light yellow. Although most of the townsfolk didn't mind this, for Roland, there was nothing worse than having to keep the windows and doors tightly shut during the hot summer.



As a result, the horse-drawn carts carrying cement and crushed stone were quickly fitted with covers to reduce spillage during transportation. At the same time, under the promotion of Leaf's ability, the town was covered with tree shades in just a few days. Rows of lush French parasol trees lined the streets symmetrically, creating a verdant view. Additionally, Roland called on all the citizens to actively sprinkle water to reduce dust, and this problem was soon alleviated.



The straight-line distance between the two places was less than seventy kilometers, but considering that the road construction had to avoid the foothills extending from the Impassable Mountain Range, the total length of the road was about one hundred kilometers, with an estimated construction period of one year. With a quality road, some means of transportation could also be put to use—such as bicycles and steam-powered vehicles.



In his vision, whether it was developing education or building roads, both were measures to connect the two regions, much like the urban-rural integration vigorously promoted in later generations. After the land between the two regions was developed, Longsong Stronghold and Border Town would merge into a massive city. If he could also turn the hills to the south into part of the city and break through the Impassable Mountain Range, they would even have a port.



Of course, developing such a vast amount of land would require a larger population, and to prepare for possible future wars, the city would need to be self-sufficient in agriculture while also providing a large workforce for industrial production. A preliminary estimate showed that he would need to bring in about a hundred thousand people, while the largest city in Graycastle, King's City, only had around twenty to thirty thousand inhabitants.



Prince Roland set his sights on the north and the southern border of Graycastle, both of which had experienced war. When the cold winter arrived, it was very likely that there would be many refugees lacking food and clothing. By merely providing food to fill their stomachs and warm shelters, he could absorb them into Border Town. He was even considering the refugees from Eternal Winter and Wolfheart. For this reason, he had also written a letter to the merchant Margaret, asking her to help inquire about the situation in these two countries.



...



After writing down the short-term development plans, the prince folded the paper and placed it in the drawer. He stretched out and decided to go see how Anna was doing with cutting the lenses for the microscope.



Ever since he learned about the evolution of sorceresses, he had been planning to make a microscope that could observe cellular structures.



Being able to witness the wondrous micro-world with their own eyes might trigger the evolution of new abilities in more witches, or at the very least, spark their interest in learning.



As for making a microscope, the two convex lenses used to magnify the object were not the difficult part. The challenge was that the hand-polished lenses each had a different focal length, so matching the eyepiece with the objective lens was a meticulous task that required repeatedly adjusting the distance between the two lenses.



After explaining the principle of convex lens imaging, he handed Anna several pieces of high-quality crystal and asked her to try cutting the lenses and measuring their focal lengths. Three days had passed since then, and Roland was curious about Anna's progress.



Approaching Anna's room, Nightingale gave him a smile and leaned against the wall, indicating that she would not follow him inside—ever since she reduced her invisibility time, Roland no longer had to guess her whereabouts. When alone with Anna, Nightingale always chose to stand at a distance.



Pushing open the door, Anna was seated at the table, fiddling with a metal tube.



"How is it going?" he asked as he approached.



No sooner had he spoken than Roland was stunned. On the table lay several devices that looked like microscopes, closely resembling the rough sketches he had drawn.



"I've made a few prototypes based on the drawings you gave me. Indeed, I can see many details that are usually hard to find," she said, tilting her head back as her long fringe slid to one side—since the hot air balloon trip, Anna had stopped using formal language when alone with him, which made him feel quite relaxed.



"How did you manage to make it?" Roland asked in amazement. "The diagram was just a rough outline."



"The outline was enough," Anna said with a smile. "Look, as long as the eyepiece and objective lens are fixed at the proper distance, they can magnify. Then, using a metal tube to hold them in place, the main body of the microscope is complete. When testing the magnifying effect of the lenses, I found that the objective lens and the observation target must be kept at a specific distance to see a clear image, and it blurs with the slightest shake. As you can see from the sketch, you need a stand to fix the tube in place, and the platform holding the target below can move up and down to obtain the optimal object distance." She paused. "The flat piece at the bottom of the diagram is a bit hard to understand. Can you tell me what it's for?"



Roland glanced at the diagram and realized his mistake—it was a reflecting mirror, meant to increase the light passing through the target. In this era, mercury mirrors had not yet been invented. The nobility still used copper or iron mirrors for their toilette, while in the palace, silver foil was applied behind glass for a better reflective effect. Even without the mirror, as long as there was sufficient sunlight, the microscope could be used.



After explaining in detail, he couldn't help but admire Anna's astonishing comprehension. Just from a rough outline, she had created a product close to its final form, something he himself could never have achieved.



Watching the other party lower her head to inspect the new telescope and expose her fair neck, Roland couldn't help but lean forward, wanting to kiss it, but she pressed her hand against his face and gently pushed him away, "Wait a moment, Your Highness, I'm busy right now."

"Uh... alright then."
