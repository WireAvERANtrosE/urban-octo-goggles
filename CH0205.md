After repelling Timothy's forces, the town returned to its peaceful state.

Roland selected three people from the Ministry of Education at the City Hall and, together with two teachers, formed a team to take the books copied by Soraya to Longsong Stronghold. Regardless of the results, he had taken the first step towards integrating the stronghold.

Although Petro was not adept at commanding battles, he excelled in administration. Within a week, two thousand recruits for road maintenance labor had arrived at the town under the escort of knights. Had it not been for the second batch of ten kilns going into production, Roland would not have dared to commit to building a solid road between the two places. Now, he finally had the opportunity to be lavish.

This road was named King's Avenue by Roland, and was entirely overseen by Minister of Construction Karl. Its structure was identical to the streets in town, consisting of a cement-stabilized gravel layer, which was sufficient to bear the burden of transportation in an era without heavy vehicles. Furthermore, it had good drainage properties and could later be upgraded with asphalt or concrete as circumstances allowed.

For construction materials, four steam-powered milling machines replaced human labor to crush rocks, producing dozens of tons of crushed stone daily. The limited transport capacity restricted the increase in output—hundreds of people using horse-drawn carts were needed to transport the stones to the construction site each day. If they had the dominant road vehicles of the future, dump trucks, a single truck could have carried the entire load.

Aside from the four kilns that maintained clay brick firing, the remaining blast furnaces were all used for producing cement powder. After multiple component tests and the addition of iron powder supplied by the mines, the cement produced by the town now far surpassed the quality and stability of the initial batches.

However, the large-scale transport of crushed stone and cement powder also brought negative impacts to the town, with dust pollution being the most serious. By the afternoon, even a slight wind would stir up dense clouds of dust, and the streets would turn a light yellow. Although most townsfolk did not mind this, for Roland, there was nothing worse than having to keep windows and doors tightly shut during the hot summer.

Consequently, covers were quickly added to the horse-drawn carts carrying cement and crushed stone to reduce scattering during transport. Also, with Leaf's abilities, the town was covered in tree shade within a few days, with lush plane trees symmetrically lining the streets, presenting a vista of verdant greenery. Coupled with Roland's call for all residents to actively sprinkle water to reduce dust, this issue was soon mitigated.

The straight-line distance between the two places was less than seventy kilometers, but considering the need to avoid the foothills extending from the Barren Mountains during road construction, the total length of the road was around one hundred kilometers, with an expected construction period of one year. With a high-quality road, some vehicles could now be put to use—such as bicycles and steam-powered vehicles.



In his conception, whether it was developing education or building roads, both were measures to connect the two places, just like the urban-rural integration vigorously promoted in later generations. After the land development between the two places was completed, Longsong Stronghold and Border Town would merge into a huge city. If he could also turn the hills at the southern end into part of the city and break through the peripheral mountain range, he would even have a sea outlet.



Of course, developing so much land required a larger population, and to prepare for possible future wars, the city must be self-sufficient in agriculture while also providing a large workforce for industrial production. A preliminary estimate showed that he needed to introduce around one hundred thousand people, while the largest city in Greycastle, the capital, had only about twenty to thirty thousand people.



Roland set his sights on the northern and southern borders of Greycastle, both of which had experienced war. When the cold winter arrived, there would likely be a large number of refugees lacking food and clothing. He could attract them to Border Town by merely providing food to fill their stomachs and warm places to live. Even the refugees from Eternal Winter and Wolfheart were within his considerations. For this purpose, he had also written a letter to the merchant Margaret, asking for her help in inquiring about the situation in these two countries.



...



After writing down the recent development plan, the prince folded the paper and placed it in the drawer. He stretched and decided to visit Anna's room to see how her lens cutting was progressing.



Ever since learning the reason for Soraya's evolution, he had planned to make a microscope that could observe cellular structures.



If he could personally observe the fascinating micro-world, it might trigger more witches to evolve new abilities, or at the very least, it could arouse their interest in learning.



For the making of the microscope, the two convex lenses used to magnify the target were not the difficult part; the difficulty lay in the fact that each hand-polished lens had a different focal length. Therefore, matching the eyepiece with the objective lens was a delicate task, requiring repeated adjustments of the distance between the two lenses.



After briefly explaining the imaging principle of the convex lens, he gave Anna several pieces of high-quality crystal and asked her to try cutting the lenses and measuring their focal lengths. Three days had passed, and Roland was full of curiosity about how far Anna had progressed.



Approaching Anna's room, Nightingale smiled at him, leaning against the wall to stand, as if to indicate she wouldn't follow him in—since she had reduced her invisibility time, Roland no longer had to guess her whereabouts. Whenever he was alone with Anna, Nightingale always chose to stand at a distance.



Pushing open the door, Anna was sitting at the desk, fiddling with a metal tube.



"How is it going?" he asked as he approached.



The question had just left his mouth when Roland was stunned. On the table, there were several devices that looked like microscopes, which closely resembled the schematic he had sketched by hand.



"I made a few prototypes based on the drawings you gave me, and indeed, they reveal many details that are difficult to detect normally," she said, looking up as her long fringe slid to one side. "I used it to observe paper, leaves, and standing water, and found they look very different from what we see with the naked eye."—Since their balloon journey, Anna had stopped using honorifics when alone with him, which made him feel much more at ease.



"How did you make it," Roland asked in amazement, "that drawing was just a rough outline."



"The outline was enough," Anna smiled. "Look, as long as the eyepiece and the objective lens are fixed at the right distance, they can magnify the object. Then by fixing them with a metal tube, the main body of the microscope is complete. When I tested the magnifying effect of the lens, I found that the objective lens and the object being observed must be kept at a specific distance to see a clear image; any shake of the hand would blur it. As you can see from your drawing, it requires a stand to hold the tube in place, and the platform that carries the object can be moved up and down to obtain the optimum object distance." She paused, "The flat piece at the bottom of the drawing is a bit difficult to understand, can you tell me what it's for?"



Roland glanced at the drawing and realized his mistake—that was a reflecting mirror, used to increase the light passing through the object, but in this era, mercury mirrors had not yet been invented. Nobles still used copper or iron mirrors to groom themselves, while the palace used glass backed with silver foil to achieve better reflection. Even without this mirror, the microscope could still be used as long as there was sufficient sunlight.



After explaining in detail, he couldn't help but marvel at Anna's extraordinary comprehension. Merely based on a rough outline, she had created a product that was close to being fully realized, something he certainly could not have done himself.



Watching her fair neck exposed as she bent down to inspect the new telescope, Roland couldn't help but lean in, wanting to plant a kiss, but she gently pushed him away with a hand on his face, "Wait, Your Highness, I'm busy right now."

"Um... alright then."
