## Sister and Younger Sister
"Welcome to the Witch Union!" In the hall, a group of witches of various ages and vibrant colors raised their glasses and laughed in celebration.



"Th-thank you all," Lucia felt her eyes getting warm again. She sniffled, holding back the urge to cry, and raised her glass to drink down the barley beer—it wasn't as bitter as she remembered, but rather had a hint of sweetness amidst the aroma of the liquor.



After meeting the lord, with Nightingale's help, she and Soraya had taken a hot bath and changed into clean clothes. After settling her sister, Lucia followed Nightingale back to the castle hall. Here, the witches had thrown her a welcome party.



This was the first time Lucia had seen so many of her kind, and the last bit of doubt in her heart dissipated with this realization. If witches were imprisoned here, or forced to serve the lord, they would not be able to show such light and bright smiles.



Recalling Nightingale's words, "This is the home of witches," she suddenly felt a sense of empathy. Compared to those witches who had exposed their identities and were hunted and executed by the Church, having a safe and comfortable haven was not easy. Since the city of Valencia was attacked by mobs, in just over a month, she had suffered the bitterness of being on the run. The warm welcome from the Witch Union finally allowed her to relax a little.



She also witnessed how magical a banquet could become when it was initiated and attended solely by witches.



Black flames instantly grilled the meat until it was golden brown, and the wooden bowl holding it remained completely unscathed.



A little girl with golden short hair flew through the air, going back and forth as she filled everyone's cups with wine.



A witch who looked like a member of a different race imitated a variety of musical instruments, eventually blending into a single, enchanting piece of music.



Under Nightingale's individual introductions, she quickly remembered everyone's names and unconsciously integrated into the group, which also diluted her sadness considerably.



In the Witch Union, there were mature and steady scrolls and Wendy, sisters like Leaf and Echo, as well as people of her own age like Anna and Soraya. No one treated her as a stranger. For this, Lucia was filled with gratitude.



After the banquet ended, she bid the witches goodnight and returned to her new residence—the prince had provided the last guest room on the second floor of the castle for her and Lily. Even though Lily was not a witch, he did not order Lucia to separate from her sister.



"Sister?" Hearing movement, Lily opened her eyes.



"You're awake!?" Lucia was overjoyed, quickly running to the bedside in three steps, "How do you feel?"



Lily looked as if she had had a good sleep, with no trace of the pain that the plague had brought. Her eyes were somewhat dazed, but she muttered, "I'm so hungry."



"Wait a moment..." Lucia hurriedly took out a cloth bag from her pocket, and upon opening it, the aroma of grilled fish wafted out—this was a dried fish slice given to her by Nightingale. "Here's something to eat."



Seeing Lily sitting on the bed nibbling on the fish slice, she patted the little one's head with relief. Her sister was only ten years old this year, and now without their parents, the only one she could rely on was herself.



After swallowing two slices of fish, Ling sobered up quite a bit. She looked around and asked, "Where are we? The boat doesn't seem to have such a big bed."

"We're in the Western Region's Border Town. We've arrived at our destination."

"We're already here?" She touched her cheek, "But wasn't I... sick? Would they agree to let a plague patient enter the town?"

"Yeah, indeed they wouldn't," Lucia was amused by her sister's bewildered look, "but the lord's witches cured you," she detailed what had happened at the dock, "and now we're staying in his castle."

"A witch?" Ling tilted her head, "Like you, sister?"

"That's right, everyone has been very nice to me, especially a witch named Nightingale," Lucia gently played with her hair, "she even helped you bathe."

"Hmm, didn't you always say that nobles hate witches? Why would the lord be willing to take them in?"

This question made Lucia pause for a moment, and she coughed twice, "Well... there are occasionally one or two good people among the nobles."

Ling picked up the last slice of dried fish from the bag, "So do you need to work for him? Like a maid at home, sweeping, cooking, and attending to the bedroom?"



"What nonsense are you talking about," Lucia grabbed her sister's face, "I'm a witch! Of course, I use my abilities to serve the lord! As for the things a maid should do, who told you that?"

"Mom..." she pouted, "That's why she never allowed dad to recruit beautiful maids."

Speaking of her family, Lucia's face suddenly darkened, and she didn't blame Bell anymore but hugged her sister tightly and sighed softly.

She wasn't worried about her sister's words, as she could tell from her conversations with His Lordship - aside from asking about her background, his main focus was on her abilities, clearly caring more about whether a witch could serve him.

And thinking of her own abilities, Lucia felt anxious.

She was not ignorant of the world of witches; the city of Valencia had seen many witches before, but half a year ago, they began to leave the city one after the other, reportedly heading to the Fjords to find new homes. Unwilling to leave her parents, she did not agree to travel with them. However, through several encounters, Lucia at least knew that witches tended to categorize their abilities into combat and non-combat types.

Restoring objects was utterly useless; not to mention using it in battle, even in daily use, it was difficult to control - her father was a merchant who ran a paper mill, and the living room was often piled with finished straw paper. On the day she became a witch, she inadvertently used her ability and turned these sheets of paper back into piles of flying chaff and debris. Although her parents scolded her severely afterward, they did not hand her over to the church but told her to be careful to hide herself and wear the God's Stone of Retaliation when necessary, pretending to be a devout believer.

Initially, Lucia was curious about her ability and often sneaked into her bedroom to test the restoration of various items, but she soon realized that the ability was very difficult to control. With the same straw paper, sometimes it left chaff, and other times it was black particles. If she used her power on the same object continuously, it would only make it less and less until the final product was either powder or gravel - this meant that the restoration ability could not be used to remake damaged items; she would only completely destroy what others had painstakingly made.

Other witches also thought Lucia's ability was of little use; it had to be used too close in combat and was ineffective on living beings. Not to mention a well-trained knight, even an ordinary farmer would be hard to beat. She was not considered a combat witch, and for non-combat purposes, no use could be found; her ability was almost the lowest tier.



For this reason, she had been sulking for a long time.

But now... what Lucia was more worried about was whether His Highness would drive her out of the castle if he thought she was of no use?

With an uneasy heart, she blew out the candle and, holding her sister who had finished gnawing on the dried fish and was content, slowly closed her eyes, waiting for the arrival of a new day.
