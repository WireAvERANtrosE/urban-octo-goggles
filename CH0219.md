## Sister and Younger Sister
"Welcome to the Witch Union!" In the hall, a group of witches of various ages and vibrant colors raised their glasses and laughed.

"Th-thank you all," Lucia felt the warmth in her eyes again. She sniffled, holding back the urge to cry, and lifted her glass to down the barley beer—not as bitter as she remembered, but fragrant with a hint of sweetness.



After meeting the lord, she had taken a hot bath with Tilly's assistance and changed into a clean set of clothes. After settling her sister, Lucia followed Nightingale back to the castle hall. Here, the witches had prepared a welcome banquet for her.



For the first time, Lucia saw so many of her kind, and the last bit of doubt in her heart dissipated. If witches were imprisoned here or forced to serve the lord, they could not have such light and bright smiles.



Remembering Nightingale's words, "This is the home of witches," she suddenly felt a sense of empathy. Compared to those witches who were exposed, hunted, and executed by the church, having a safe and comfortable haven was not easy to come by. Since Golden City was attacked by thugs, in just over a month, she had suffered the hardships of being on the run. The warm welcome from the Witch Union finally allowed her to relax a bit.



She also witnessed how magical a banquet entirely initiated and attended by witches could be.



Black flames instantly grilled the meat to a crispy brown, yet the wooden platter holding it remained unscathed.



A little girl with golden short hair flew through the air, refilling everyone's cups with a pitcher.



A witch who looked like a foreigner mimicked various musical instruments, ultimately merging into a beautiful melody.



Under Nightingale's individual introductions, she quickly remembered everyone's names and unconsciously blended into the group, which also diluted her sadness considerably. 



The Witch Union had mature and steady Scroll and Wendy, sisterly Leaf and Echo, as well as peers of her own age like Anna and Soraya. Not a single person treated her as a stranger. For this, Lucia was immensely grateful.



After the banquet ended, she exchanged goodnights with the witches and returned to her new dwelling—the prince had allocated the last guest room on the second floor of the castle to her and Lily. Despite Lily not being a witch, he did not insist on separating her from her sister.



"Sister?" Hearing movement, Lily opened her eyes.



"You're awake!?" Lucia was overjoyed, rushing to the bedside in three large strides, "How do you feel?"



Lily appeared as if she had just had a long sleep, with no trace of the agony brought on by the plague. Her eyes were a bit dazed, but she mumbled, "I'm so hungry."



"Wait a second..." Lucia hurriedly pulled out a cloth bag from her pocket and opened it to reveal the aroma of baked fish—these were the dried fish slices given to her by Nightingale. "There's food here."



Seeing Lily sitting up in bed, nibbling on the fish slices, she patted the little one's head with relief. Her sister was only ten years old this year, and now without parents, the only one she could rely on was herself.



After swallowing two slices of fish, Ling regained some clarity. She looked around and asked, "Where are we? There doesn't seem to be a bed this big on the ship."

"We're in Border Town of the Western Region. We've arrived at our destination."

"Already?" She touched her cheek, "But wasn't I... sick? Would they agree to let a plague patient into town?"

"Yes, they indeed wouldn't," Lucia laughed at her sister's bewildered expression. "But the lord's witches cured you," she recounted in detail what happened at the dock, "We're now staying in his castle."

"Witches?" Ling tilted her head, "Like you, sister?"

"That's right, everyone has been very kind to me, especially a witch named Nightingale," Lucia gently stroked her hair, "She even helped you bathe."

"Hmm, don't you always say that nobles hate witches? Why would the lord take them in?"

This question made Lucia pause slightly, and she coughed twice, "Well... there are occasionally one or two good people among the nobles."

Ling picked up the last piece of dried fish from the bag, "So do you need to work for him? Like a maid at home, cleaning, cooking, and attending to his bedroom?"



"What nonsense are you talking about?" Lucia pinched her sister's face. "I'm a witch! Of course, I use my abilities to serve the lord! And who told you about the things that maids have to do?"

"Mom..." she pouted, "that's why she never lets dad hire pretty maids."

Speaking of family, Lucia's face dimmed considerably. She did not blame her sister any further but instead hugged her close, sighing softly.

She wasn't worried about her sister's comments; it was clear from her conversations with His Lordship that aside from inquiring about her background, his main focus was on her abilities, clearly more concerned about whether a witch could serve him.

And thinking about her own abilities, Lucia felt deeply troubled.

She was not completely ignorant of the world of witches. Many witches had also appeared in Gold City, but half a year ago, they began to leave the city one after another, reportedly to look for new homes in the Fjords. Unwilling to leave her parents, she didn't agree to travel with them. However, after several encounters, Lucia at least knew that witches tended to categorize their abilities into combat and non-combat types.

Restoring objects was practically useless. Not to mention using it in battle, even everyday use could lead to uncontrollable situations—her father was a businessman who ran a paper mill, and their living room was often filled with finished straw paper. On the day she became a witch, she inadvertently used her power and turned those sheets of paper back into a pile of flying straw and fragments. Although her parents scolded her severely afterwards, they did not hand her over to the church but instead told her to hide her abilities carefully and wear the Divine Stone of Judgement when necessary, posing as a devout follower.

Initially, Lucia was curious about her ability and often hid in her bedroom to test the restoration of various items. But she soon found that this power was very difficult to control. With the same straw paper, sometimes it left straw scraps, and other times black granules. If she continuously used her power on the same object, it would only diminish further, turning into powder or gravel in the end—meaning her restoration ability could not be used to redo damaged items, and she could only completely destroy what others had painstakingly made.

Other witches also thought Lucia's ability was of little use. It had to be used at close range during combat and was ineffective on living beings. Not to mention a well-trained knight, even an ordinary farmer would be hard to overcome. Her ability didn't count as combat type, and for non-combat, they couldn't think of any use for it—it was considered to be of the lowest grade.



For this reason, she had been in low spirits for quite some time.

But now... What Lucia was more worried about was whether His Highness would drive her out of the castle if he thought she was of no use?

With an uneasy heart, she blew out the candle, hugged her sister who had finished gnawing on the dried fish and was content, slowly closed her eyes, and waited for the arrival of a new day.
