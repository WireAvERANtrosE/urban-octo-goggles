## Memories (Part 2)
The drastic changes left Agatha utterly bewildered. She did not want to believe what the other party said, yet those stories sounded incredibly real—how could any witch come up with such tragic experiences if they had not lived through them themselves?

If it were her, she could never imagine being enslaved, being hunted.

Even the lowly commoners in the Holy City were still people, not animals.

She felt extremely tired, and Wendy seemed to notice her discomfort, bringing her a cup of hot milk, "Drink this, you will feel better."

Although this red-haired woman did not possess the overwhelming power and authority of the Deity of Gods, she still infected Agatha like a flame, not blistering and dazzling, but warm like water... She drank the milk, as if sweet delight she had not tasted in a long time flowed into her stomach, reviving her strength somewhat. After resting for a good while, the conversation continued.

Despite not understanding why a group of witches would be wary and guarded against another group of witches, to earn their trust and have the Divine Stone of Judgement shackles removed, she must first gain their confidence.

As to how much of what the prince and Wendy said was credible, that would have to be confirmed with her own eyes.

Before witnessing this narrow and backward wasteland with her own eyes, she would not believe that the Union had just disappeared without a trace, as if it had never existed.

"As I mentioned before, my name is Agatha, from the Quest Society of Taquila. In the thirtieth year of the Battle of Divine Will, as the last Holy City, Taquila could not hold out until the end of the war. Most people began their journey of escape, while I went to the Hidden Forest to retrieve some things that were left behind."



"Wait... you are fighting against devils?" the Prince asked.

Agatha frowned, "Who else but us? Do you really think common people like you could do it?"

"Are you a witch from the Church?"

"What is this Church? I've never heard of it," she replied impatiently. "Taquila... no, all the Holy Cities were established by witches. Tens of thousands live there, and aside from witches, most are common people like you. They are responsible for giving birth and taking care of children until they awaken, and then they are handed over to specialized organizations for training. Of course, witches skilled in combat join the Union to fight against devils."

The Prince pondered for a moment, then took out a book and handed it to her, "Can you understand what is written here?"

Agatha casually flipped through a few pages, quickly becoming engrossed, "This is... a witch's diary."

"Do you use this kind of script?" asked a witch with light gray hair.

"It was created by the Union, to differentiate it from the script used by common people, so they cannot participate in higher affairs. Although, I don't think it's a good idea."

"How was that achieved?" she inquired curiously. "If it's just another set of script, couldn't common people learn it as well?"



"It requires the use of magic," Agatha explained, "It's not a very difficult technique, if you are a witch, I could teach you."

"Language itself is a tool for communication, the more widespread it is, the better. Doing this is indeed foolish," the prince commented, "Excluding ordinary people means greatly narrowing the range of manpower available to you. In fact, after training and education, ordinary people are capable of filling many positions, they are not much worse off except for not having magic."

Even if his ideas were similar to her own, Agatha was not used to a mortal critiquing the Union's decisions. She could accept working with ordinary people without magic, but she did not like them giving orders and acting superior in front of her.

She started to miss Kaff a bit.

Even a family guard captain knew more about manners than the so-called prince.

"My name is Scroll," another witch, who looked quite old, suddenly asked, "Miss Agatha, have you ever heard of the name Akaris?"

Agatha's hand trembled slightly, "Where did you hear that name? Wasn't it said that everything from 450 years ago was lost?"

"I once found an ancient book in the ruins of the eastern forest of Greycastle," Scroll said, "It's the one you're holding, her name appears on the last page, and it's written in the language of ordinary people."

Agatha quickly flipped to the last page and read through the few lines of scribbled notes, sighed deeply, and remained silent for a long time. In her mind, once again, there emerged the image of that woman holding up her long sword, summoning rays of light into the world. Only this time, the shadow in the memory's golden light had grown a little larger.



It took her quite a while before she slowly said, "Akalis is the queen of the City of Starfall and is one of the three seats of the Union. She is a high-ranking Extraordinary, also known as an 'Extraordinary Above'. Even among the many blessed by the Union, she is the one with the most formidable power."



"Extraordinary... Above?" A murmur rose among the witches.



"Since these pieces of knowledge have been lost, it's normal for you not to know," Agatha said solemnly, "A witch's power continuously strengthens from the moment of awakening and then solidifies on adulthood. But that is not the limit of their abilities. Through personal enlightenment, feeling, and practice, a very few fortunate ones can take a step further and incredibly strengthen their power... We call this a high-order awakening. There is no upper limit to this awakening, and there is no rigid division in how much one's power can be amplified, but a significant change in the form of magic power can be observed."



"Uh, so it's like a power evolution?" The prince scratched the back of his head, "By that count, the Witch Union also has four witches whose abilities have evolved."



This statement almost made Agatha choke, "Four, four? How many members does the Witch Union have exactly?"



The prince counted on his fingers, "More than ten."



"If you don't know, don't spout nonsense!" She seemed somewhat irritated, "Out of more than ten people, there are four who can awaken to a higher order? You have no idea what that means. Don't equate it with the solidification on adulthood day or branching abilities, it's not the same at all! Those who obtain promotion are without exception the darlings of the gods, and both opportunity and personal effort are indispensable!"



The prince seemed somewhat helpless as he gestured, "Anna."



A beautiful and composed girl, Agatha thought as she watched the witch walk to the bedside. Even among the witches, such an appearance was quite outstanding. Her blue eyes were like the surface of a moonlit ice lake, so clear that one could see their own reflection. But she was too young, probably just of age, and lacked experience in training, feeling, and enlightenment. Agatha knew all too well how difficult it was to advance, having done so at the age of twenty-six, which was considered a prodigy in the Union—only those who have experienced it truly understood the difficulty.



Perhaps they mistook the abilities developed at adulthood for high-level awakening, Agatha thought to herself.

A cluster of orange flame appeared in Anna's palm.

"Fire ability, a very common summoning type, can be measured by maximum temperature and heating speed to assess mastery. Those who can spew it out can be considered combat witches," she quickly evaluated.

No sooner had she finished speaking than the flame dimmed, turning into a wisp of faint blue-green fire. It slowly shifted its color, from dark green to light green, but no matter what, the green flame seemed to be devouring the surrounding light to replenish itself.

"This is her solidified ability upon reaching adulthood, and what comes next is the key point," the prince explained.

Solidified? No... How could this be solidified? Adulthood should only make the flame hotter, the core brighter, larger. She couldn't help but gape, and what did he mean by what comes next is the key point?

Soon enough, Agatha witnessed an inconceivable scene—the green fire disappeared, replaced by a black cube. It had completely lost the appearance of a flame, looking like a lusterless metal block with smooth, even walls, and sharp edges, quietly standing in the witch's hand.
