## Hot Air Balloon Journey
The principle of the hot air balloon is very simple, and there are only two difficulties in making it: one is the combustion device, and the other is the gasbag.

The first point, in the absence of a pressure vessel to provide gaseous fuel, relying solely on firewood or charcoal to heat the air is not only inefficient but also limited by fuel, which would not allow for long flights. This is also why the principle of hot air balloons was discovered very early in history, but hydrogen balloons were the first to be employed in actual use. Therefore, Roland simply gave up on the combustion device and let Anna ignite and heat it up.

The difficulty with the gasbag lies in its airtightness, but for Roland, who has learned from the experiences of predecessors, this problem is easily solved—by using layered fabrics. The outermost layer of the gasbag is made of durable canvas, lined with a cow intestine membrane in the middle, and the inner layer is a lightweight gauze. Stitching these together can prevent air leakage and is also not afraid of birds pecking.

Roland spread the bottom of the gasbag and let Anna spray Blackfire into it, which has a temperature close to that of an ordinary flame. The gasbag slowly inflated, looking like a wrinkled winter melon. Considering that the hot air balloon needed to carry two people into the sky, the gasbag had a diameter of five meters at its widest point, using the membranes of twelve cows' intestines, and the sewing work took nearly a week. If he wasn't a lord governing a territory, he probably couldn't afford such a large toy.

"Does it fly by using the buoyancy provided by the hot air?" Anna asked, "I remember reading in a book that hot air always rises."

"That's right, hot air rises and cold air sinks, which is a common natural phenomenon. Explained by the particle theory, it means that the movement of the hotter air molecules intensifies, their ability to disperse outward is stronger, and after expanding, their density becomes smaller. To the surrounding air that hasn't changed, it is relatively lighter and therefore rises."

After explaining the principle, Roland found that aside from Anna, who showed an expression of realization, the other three were all baffled, which made him silently lament the importance of talent.

When the gasbag was fully inflated and began to float upward, the tethering ropes were slowly pulled taut, and Roland was the first to climb into the basket, followed by helping Anna as she climbed in.

"I'm still a bit worried," Nightingale said uneasily, "How about you let me go up and try it first?"



"Trust me, nothing will go wrong," Roland said with an easy smile, "And even if something unexpected happens, Lightning is here."

"I will catch them, don't worry," Lightning patted her chest confidently.

"And me coo!" Maggie mimicked Lightning, patting her chest as well.

With a shake, the hot air balloon pulled the basket off the ground and began to climb upwards. Before long, they had surpassed the top of the castle, and the full view of the town unfolded before them.

For Roland, such a sight was not unfamiliar, after all, he had seen skyscrapers before, but for Anna, it was a completely new experience that differed vastly from any perspective she had known before. She leaned over the edge of the basket, peering out with one hand firmly gripping Roland's arm, a mix of excitement and nervousness on her face.

It was the first time Roland had seen her with such an expression. Perhaps for someone whose feet had never left the ground, their first flight towards the sky would naturally induce a slight fear of heights.

After a short while, the hemp rope used to tether the hot air balloon was pulled taut, and the ascent stopped. The rope was about fifty meters long, which is about the height of a fifteen or sixteen-story building in later eras. Roland asked Anna to reduce the flame, and the hot air balloon eventually hovered in the air.

Lightning initially stayed close to the basket, but once she saw that it was stable, she relaxed and started to play chase with Maggie around the hot air balloon.

From this vantage point, they could clearly see the castle's rooftops, the town where construction was everywhere, the Redwater River flowing from west to east, and the lush green farmlands beside the river.



"How do you feel?"

It was not until Anna withdrew her head that Roland smiled and asked.

"Thank you for your gift," she said excitedly, "I never knew I could fly so high."

"We can go even higher," Roland sat down next to the vine basket's wall, "If we had a longer hemp rope, flying ten times this distance wouldn't be a problem. However, the higher you go, the more complex the air currents become, making it difficult to ensure safety. And this is just a basic flying device. Once we build a piston engine, ordinary people will be able to fly faster and higher than birds. And then..." he looked up at the azure sky, "people might even be able to fly out of this world, to the boundless expanse of space."

Anna held her breath, her eyes shining with excitement, as if something was about to burst forth.

"I can't guarantee flying out of the world," Roland was amused by her expression, "but building a piston engine, allowing ordinary people to fly like birds, should be possible within our lifetime." In fact, with Anna present, there was no longer a bottleneck in processing capability; the current shortcoming was in material performance. Inferior pig iron could be used to make do for steam engines, wrought iron could be used for cannons, and steel refined with black powder for revolvers wasn't a big issue, but for internal combustion engines, we would probably need high-quality cast iron, cast steel, or aluminum. "Border Town has become what it is today, all thanks to you, 'Miss Anna'."

Hearing this, Anna was stunned. After a while, she leaned in and spoke softly, "My mother died in a fire, and instead of perishing in smoke and flames, I became a witch. For a long time, I thought that it was my awakening that caused the fire, and I loathed being a witch. When I was locked up in jail, I thought maybe I could find some relief, but you rescued me from the cell, taught me how to use my abilities... I never imagined that fire could have so many uses beyond destruction and pain." Anna paused for a moment, "I should be utterly content for having met you, but now I find my thoughts have changed. Sometimes I feel so frustrated inside, wanting more."

She placed her hand on Roland's shoulder, "Even so, do you still wish to employ me?"

Her lake-blue eyes were sparkling, her breath tickling his face. Through the thin fabric, he could feel her soft body and rapid heartbeat. Despite this, she did not shy away from his gaze—without Nightingale, she was always passionate and proactive.



"There's something outside..." Roland hadn't finished speaking when Anna sealed his lips with hers.

After they parted, he took a light breath, "I want to employ you, always. Miss Anna."

"Mhm."

This time, it was he who leaned in to close the gap between them.

...

"Eh, wait," Maggie followed Lightning for a while, then suddenly came to a sharp stop in the air and looked towards the empty basket, "They're gone, coo!"

"Huh?" Lightning tilted her head to glance, "They just sat down."

"But then they can't see the scenery outside, can they?"



"Scenery can always be seen, but such opportunities are rare."

"Opportunity?" Maggie flapped her wings and landed on Lightning's shoulder, "I don't quite understand, coo. Should we go and check on them, coo?"

"That's absolutely not okay," Lightning hugged the pigeon tightly, "This is a sacred ceremony that must not be interrupted."

"Coo?"

"Anyway, you'll understand later. At times like these, it's best to pretend we didn't see anything. This is what my dad—the greatest explorer—told me." Lightning tossed Maggie into the air, put her hands on her hips, and said, "Now run fast, it's my turn to chase you!"
