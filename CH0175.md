## Hot Air Balloon Journey
The principle of the hot air balloon is very simple; there are only two difficulties in making one: the burner and the balloon itself.



The first point is that, without a pressure vessel to provide gaseous fuel, relying solely on firewood or charcoal to heat the air is not only inefficient, but also won't fly far due to fuel limitations. This is also why the principle of the hot air balloon was discovered very early in history, but hydrogen balloons were the first to be used in actual combat. Therefore, Roland simply gave up on the burner and let Anna ignite and heat the air.



The difficulty with the balloon lies in its airtightness, but for Roland, who had learned from the experience of his predecessors, this problem was easily solved—by using layered fabric. The outermost layer of the balloon is made of durable canvas, with a cow intestine membrane in the middle, and a light gauze on the inside. Sewn together, it can prevent air leaks while also being resistant to pecking by birds.



Roland spread open the bottom of the balloon, allowing Anna to spray into it a black fire that was close to the temperature of an ordinary flame. The balloon slowly swelled up, looking like a wrinkled winter melon. Considering that the hot air balloon needed to carry two people into the sky, the widest part of the balloon had a diameter of five meters, using up the intestinal membranes of twelve cows, with the sewing work taking nearly a week. If he wasn't a lord with dominion over a territory, he really might not have been able to afford such a big toy.



"Does it fly by using the buoyancy provided by the hot air?" Anna asked. "I remember reading in a book that hot air always rises."



"Exactly, hot air rising and cold air sinking is a common natural phenomenon. To explain it using particle theory, it's because the movement of the hotter air particles intensifies, they have a stronger ability to spread outwards, and after expansion, their density becomes lower. Compared to the surrounding unchanged air, it's as if it has become lighter, and therefore it will rise."



After Roland explained the principle, he found that aside from Anna, who showed an expression of realization, the other three were all looking confused, which made him silently lament the importance of talent.



When the balloon was fully inflated and began to rise, the tethering ropes were slowly pulled taut. Roland was the first to climb into the basket, and then he took Anna's hand as she clambered in after him.



"I'm still a bit worried," Nightingale said anxiously. "Why don't you let me go up first to try it out?"



"Trust me, nothing will happen," Roland said with an easy smile, "and even if there is an accident, Lightning is here."

"I will catch them, don't worry," Lightning patted her chest.

"And me coo!" Maggie imitated Lightning's action and patted her chest.

With a bit of shaking, the hot air balloon pulled the basket off the ground and started to ascend. Before long, the two of them had crossed over the top of the castle, and the entirety of the town was laid out before them.

For Roland, such a sight was not unfamiliar; after all, he had seen skyscrapers before. But for Anna, it was a completely new experience, a perspective vastly different from anything she had seen before. She leaned over the edge of the basket to look out, holding tightly onto Roland's arm, both excited and nervous.

This was the first time Roland had seen her with such an expression. Perhaps for someone whose feet had never left the ground, their first flight towards the sky would naturally cause a slight fear of heights.

After a while, the hemp rope used to tether the hot air balloon was stretched to its limit and the ascent stopped. The rope was about fifty meters long, which equated to the height of a fifteen or sixteen-story building in later times. Roland asked Anna to reduce the firepower, and the hot air balloon eventually hovered in the air.

At first, Lightning stayed close to the edge of the basket, but once she saw that the basket was stable, she relaxed and started to play a chasing game with Maggie around the hot air balloon.

Looking down from here, one could clearly see the castle roof, the town where construction was ongoing everywhere, the Redwater River flowing from west to east, and the lush green farmland beside the river.



"How does it feel?"

It wasn't until Anna withdrew her head that Roland asked with a smile.

"Thank you for your gift," she said excitedly, "I never knew I could fly so high."

"You can go even higher," Roland sat down beside the vine basket's wall, "If the hemp rope below was longer, flying ten times this distance wouldn't be a problem. However, the higher you go, the more complex the air currents, making safety harder to guarantee. And this is just a primitive flying machine; when we create the piston engine in the future, ordinary people will be able to fly faster and higher than birds. And beyond that..." he looked up at the azure sky, "people might even fly out of this world and into the boundless space."

"..." Anna held her breath, her eyes shining with something that seemed ready to burst forth.

"I can't promise we'll fly out of the world," Roland was amused by her expression, "but creating a piston engine to allow ordinary people to fly like birds should be achievable within our lifetime." In fact, with Anna here, there was no longer a bottleneck in processing capabilities; the current shortcoming was in material performance. Inferior pig iron could be used to make do for steam engines, wrought iron for cannons, and steel made from black powder for revolving firearms was also fine, but for internal combustion engines, we'd likely need high-quality cast iron, cast steel or aluminum. "Border Town has become what it is today, and it's all thanks to you, 'Miss Anna'."

Upon hearing this, Anna froze. After a while, she leaned in and whispered, "My mother died in a fire, but instead of perishing in the thick smoke and flames, I became a witch. For a long time, I thought it was my awakening that caused the fire and intensely loathed being a witch. When I was locked up in the cell, I thought that maybe it would bring me relief, but you rescued me from the prison, taught me how to use my abilities... I never imagined that fire, apart from bringing destruction and pain, could also have so many uses." Anna paused, "Meeting you, I should feel extremely content, but now I find my thoughts have changed, sometimes I feel so stifled inside, longing for more."

She climbed onto Roland's shoulder, "Even so, would you still want to employ me?"

Her lake-blue eyes sparkled, her breath tickling his face, creating a somewhat itchy sensation. Through the thin layer of clothing, he could feel her soft body and pounding heartbeat. Despite this, she did not shy away from his gaze—without Nightingale around, she was always passionate and proactive.



"Outside there is......"

Roland hadn't finished speaking when Anna sealed his lips with hers.

After they parted, he took a light breath, "I want to hire you, forever. Miss Anna."

"Mhm."

This time, he leaned down proactively, closing the distance between them.

...

"Eh, wait," Maggie followed Lightning for a while, then suddenly came to an abrupt stop in the air, looking towards the empty basket, "They've disappeared, coo!"

"Ah?" Lightning glanced to the side, "They just sat down."

"Then wouldn't that mean they can't see the scenery outside?"



"The scenery is always there to be seen, but such opportunities are rare."

"Opportunity?" Maggie flapped her wings and landed on Lightning's shoulder, "I don't quite understand, coo. Should we go and have a look at them, coo?"

"That's absolutely not okay," Lightning hugged the pigeon tightly, "This is a sacred ceremony that must not be interrupted."

"Coo?"

"Anyway, you'll understand later. At times like this, it's best to pretend we didn't see anything. This is what my dad—the greatest explorer—told me." Lightning threw Maggie off, put her hands on her hips, and declared, "Now run fast, it's my turn to chase you!"
