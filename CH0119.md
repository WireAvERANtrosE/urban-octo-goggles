## Ransom (Part 1)
Peter Helmann sat at his desk, unconsciously fiddling with a beautiful piece of parchment in his hand—that was the program from the Longsong Theater that came every weekend afternoon. Normally, he would have chosen his favorite play, let the butler pay the deposit, and then send the invitation to Sheryl.



But now he couldn't focus on a single word.



Today was the seventh day since the expedition, and if all had gone well, his father should have returned with the Duke yesterday. Perhaps there was a delay on the road, or perhaps, tired and weary, they rested for an extra day in Border Town? He comforted himself, yet the unease in his heart was slowly growing.



Prince Roland Wimbledon had left too deep an impression on Peter, and he even found it unbelievable why such an outstanding prince had such a terrible reputation in the capital. Bad-tempered, profligate, incompetent, uneducated... none of these evaluations matched the prince he had met.



That was exactly why his anxiety was so intense.



He was afraid that the Duke would lose to him.



"Young Master Peter," the butler called from outside the door, "there's a letter from the stronghold."



From the stronghold? Peter was stunned, "Bring it in quickly."



As he opened the envelope, the first line on the letter made Peter's eyes widen in shock.



This is a letter from the Fourth Prince!

"Duke Osmond Ryan attacked my territory with force in an attempt to rebel but failed. The Duke himself has been executed on the battlefield, and now Longsong Stronghold has fallen into my hands."

The Duke lost? His heart sank abruptly as he continued to read.

"Except for a few stubborn elements, the majority of the Duke of Lion's party have surrendered and confessed their guilt. The rebellious royal family members should be executed, but I, in my mercy, have decided to only execute the ringleaders and those whose crimes are unforgivable. The other participants may redeem the captives with money according to the usual customs of warfare. The exchange location will be at the lord's castle of Longsong Stronghold, and below is the list."

The wording of this official document was awkward and not the language of diplomacy, but its meaning couldn't be clearer—the Duke's rebellion had failed, and if you want your captives back, you have to pay for them.

Peter's gaze moved slightly downward, and his father's name appeared prominently in the first row.

"Hedys!" he shouted for the butler, "Prepare the carriage, I must go to the stronghold castle!"

...

The Honeysuckle Count's territory was east of the stronghold, and by the time Peter arrived at the castle district, half an hour had passed. The front of the lord's castle was filled with "militia" he had never seen before—they didn't have shining iron armor, nor cloaks or ribbons, and in their hands, they held strangely shaped short sticks, with sharp spears attached at the top. Just standing in two neat rows, holding their heads high and chests out, they exuded an imposing aura.



After confirming his identity, Peter was led into the garden and then escorted to the castle hall by a guard.

He had been to this place many times before, but today, it felt like entering a completely unfamiliar territory. The guards standing watch in the corridors were all faces he had never seen before. No one nodded or smiled at him; instead, they looked him over expressionlessly. At the entrance of the hall, a knight came forward to greet him.

"Your name?"

"Peter Helmann," Peter replied with slight displeasure, not fond of this interrogative style of conversation. He emphasized again, "Sir Helmann."

"Oh," the other party seemed unimpressed as he glanced at the list in his hand, "Count Shalafi Helmann is your..."

"Father."

"My apologies," the knight said verbally, though his expression showed not a hint of regret, "I am Carter Lannis, the chief knight of the Fourth Prince. Please come to the side room first; we need to check if you are carrying any weapons."

After a search, Peter's God's Punishment Stone was also taken by the guard.

"That's not a weapon," Peter reminded.



"Of course not," the knight nodded, "we will give it back to you after the meeting, rest assured."

He opened his mouth, but in the end, he held back. Return it? That God's Punishment Stone was of high quality, worth at least fifty Gold Royals. It was impossible for it not to be switched for an inferior one once it was in their hands. Forget it, he thought, consider it a part of the ransom.



Entering the hall, the Fourth Prince was seated in the main seat, writing something. He looked up and was startled upon seeing Peter, then smiled and said, "We meet again, Mr. Ambassador."



It was the familiar face and tone. Peter also relaxed a bit and bowed, saying, "Greetings to you, Your Highness."



"Please, have a seat," Roland gestured with his hand, indicating for him to sit down, "You must already know what has happened. Your father was not harmed; he was among the first to surrender."



"Thank you for Your Highness's mercy," Peter quickly said, "I wonder how much ransom you require. As long as Honeysuckle can afford it, I will have the money sent immediately."



"I do not need money," Roland shook his finger, "I want livestock and people."



Requesting livestock was quite normal; even fifty years ago, conflicts between lords usually ended with the loser compensating with cattle and sheep. Peter had seen this more than once in books. But... asking for people? "Your Highness, there are plenty of cattle, sheep, and horses in the Honeysuckle territory, but as for the people you mentioned..."



"It's simple, I want masons, stonecutters, carpenters, farmers, serfs," the prince handed over a scroll, "You can convert according to the values listed here, as long as the total reaches three thousand." He smiled, "By the way, since the Earl is considered the highest-ranked among those captured, his value is also the highest."



Peter spread the scroll out on the table.

It was filled with categories of occupations and types of livestock, each followed by a number, such as: Cattle 3, Sheep 2, Masons 10, and so on. He immediately understood the other party's intentions.

A value of three thousand meant one thousand cattle or three hundred masons could redeem his father. Of course, his domain didn't have that many cattle or masons, and just by arranging and combining the items on the list, many choices could be produced. As a noble who dealt with trade every day, Peter realized instantly that there was much to be done here. Given a few days, he could calculate the optimal solution to meet the three thousand point value requirement with the least cost.

"Your Highness, may I...?"

"One day, I can only give you one day," Roland held up a finger, "This only refers to the time for you to make a choice. After all, gathering so many materials and people cannot be done in less than three or four days. And I won't be staying here for long, at most, I will leave this place after a week."

"But one day's time is really..." Peter suddenly froze, his eyes widening as he looked at the prince, "Wait, you just said... you're leaving?" What did that mean? If the letter wasn't wrong, the duke had already died on the battlefield, and Longsong Stronghold was in the hands of His Highness. He actually said he was leaving, could it be that this place was less important than that small and shabby border town? No, that wasn't the point! The real issue was, if His Highness left, who would manage this magnificent city? A storm surged in his heart. Would the duke's children inherit it? It was obvious that would be impossible, to wait for them to regroup an army to avenge their father? Or would it be one of the other five major families besides the Lion family, or another noble family?

"That's right," Roland nodded, "I will take the ransom and return to Border Town."

A thought suddenly surged in his heart, and once it appeared, it could no longer be suppressed.

"Your Highness," Peter swallowed, asking in a low voice, "May I ask... does 'redeeming' Longsong Stronghold also have a value?"
