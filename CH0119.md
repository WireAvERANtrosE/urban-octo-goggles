## Ransom (Part 1)
Petro Helmon sat at his desk, unconsciously fiddling with a piece of exquisite parchment in his hand—that was the program from the Longsong Theatre that was delivered every weekend afternoon. Under normal circumstances, he would have chosen his favorite play, instructed his butler to pay the deposit, and then sent the invitation to Sheryl.

But now he was not able to take in a single word.

Today was the seventh day since the expedition, and if all had gone well, his father should have returned with the Duke yesterday. Perhaps there was a delay on the road, or maybe due to exhaustion, they took an extra day of rest in Border Town? He comforted himself, yet the uneasiness in his heart was slowly growing.

The fourth prince, Roland Wimbledon, had left too deep an impression on him, and Petro even found it unbelievable why such an outstanding prince would have such a terrible reputation in the capital. Bad-tempered, profligate, incompetent, uneducated... none of these evaluations matched the prince he had met.

It was precisely because of this that his uneasiness was so intense.

He was afraid that the Duke would lose to him.

"Young Master Petro," the butler called from outside the door, "there is a letter from the fortress."

From the fortress? Petro was stunned for a moment, "Bring it in quickly."

As he opened the envelope, the first line on the letter left Petro dumbfounded.



This is a letter from the Fourth Prince!

"Duke Osmund Ryan attacked my territory by force, attempting a rebellion, but failed. The duke himself has been executed on the battlefield, and the Longsong Stronghold is now in my hands."

The duke has been defeated? His heart sank abruptly as he continued to read.

"Except for a few stubborn accomplices, the majority of Duke Ryan's followers have surrendered and confessed their guilt. Rebels against the royal family should be executed, but I, being merciful, will only execute the ringleaders and those whose crimes are unforgivable. The remaining participants can redeem the captives with money, as per the usual customs of warfare. The exchange will take place at the lord's castle of Longsong Stronghold, and below is the list."

The document was awkwardly phrased and was not in the usual diplomatic language, but the message it conveyed was crystal clear—the duke's rebellion had failed, and the captives could be exchanged for money.

Petro's gaze moved slightly downward, and his father's name appeared prominently in the first row.

"Hedys!" he shouted for the butler, "Prepare the carriage, I must go to the stronghold castle!"

...

Count Honeysuckle's territory was east of the stronghold, and by the time Petro arrived at the castle district, half an hour had passed. The front of the lord's castle was filled with "militia" that he had never seen before—they did not have gleaming armor, nor cloaks and ribbons, and they held a uniquely shaped short stick in their hands, with sharp spears attached to the top. Even though they stood in two neat rows, standing tall and proud, they exuded an imposing aura.



After reporting his identity, Petro was led into the garden and then escorted to the castle hall by a guard.

He had been to this place many times, but today, it felt like he was stepping into an entirely unfamiliar territory. The guards standing watch in the corridors were all faces he had never seen before; none of them nodded or smiled at him but instead sized him up with expressionless faces. At the entrance to the hall, a knight came forward to greet him.

"Your name?"

"Petro Helmon," Petro replied with slight displeasure, not fond of this interrogative style of conversation, so he emphasized again, "Sir Helmon."

"Oh," the other party seemed unimpressed as he glanced at the list in his hand, "Count Sharif Helmon is your..."

"Father."

"My apologies," the knight said, though his expression carried not a hint of regret, "I am Carter Lannis, the Chief Knight of the Fourth Prince. Please come to the side room; we need to check if you are carrying any weapons."

After a search, Petro's Divine Stone of Judgment was also taken by the guards.

"That's not a weapon," Petro reminded them.



"Of course not," the knight nodded, "We will return it to you after the meeting is over, rest assured."

He opened his mouth, but ultimately held back his words. Return it? That top-grade Divine Stone of Judgement was worth at least fifty Gold Royals. It would be impossible for the other party not to switch it with an inferior one once it was in their possession. Nevermind, he thought, consider it a part of the ransom.

Entering the hall, the Fourth Prince was sitting in the main seat, writing something. When he looked up and saw Petrov, he paused for a moment, then smiled and said, "We meet again, Mr. Ambassador."

It was the familiar face and tone, and Petrov relaxed a little, bowing as he greeted, "Greetings to you, Your Highness."

"Please, take a seat," Roland gestured with his hand, indicating for him to sit, "You must already be aware of what has happened. Your father has not been harmed; he was among the first batch to surrender."

"I am grateful for Your Highness's mercy," Petrov quickly said, "May I ask how much ransom you require? As long as the Honeysuckle family can afford it, I will have the money delivered immediately."

"I do not need money," Roland shook his finger, "I want livestock and people."

Wanting livestock was quite normal; even fifty years ago, conflicts between lords would end with the loser compensating with cows and sheep. This much Petrov had seen more than once in books. But... what did he mean by people? "Your Highness, there are plenty of cows, sheep, and horses in our domain, but as for the people you mention..."

"It's simple, I want bricklayers, stonemasons, carpenters, farmers, serfs," the prince handed over a scroll, "You can convert them according to the values listed here, just make sure the total reaches three thousand." He smiled, "By the way, as the Count is considered the highest-ranking among those captured, his value is also the highest."



Petro spread the scroll out on the table.

It was filled with categories of professions and types of livestock, each followed by a number, such as: 3 for cows, 2 for sheep, 10 for stonemasons, and so on. He immediately understood the other party's meaning.

A value of three thousand meant redeeming his father would cost a thousand cows, or three hundred stonemasons. Of course, his domain did not have that many cows or stonemasons, and just by arranging and combining the items on the paper, many choices could be made. As a noble who dealt with trade every day, Petro realized in an instant that there was much to be done here. Given a few days, he could calculate the optimal solution to meet the requirement of three thousand points with the least expense.

"Your Highness, may I..."

"One day, I can only give you one day," Roland extended a finger, "this refers only to the time for you to make a choice. After all, it would take three or four days to gather so many resources and people. And I won't be staying here for long, I will leave this place in at most a week."

"But one day is really..." Petro suddenly stiffened, his eyes widening as he looked at the prince, "Wait, you just said... you're leaving?" What did that mean? If the letter was correct, the Duke had already perished on the battlefield, Longsong Stronghold was in His Highness's hands, and yet he spoke of leaving. Could this place be even less important than that small, broken town? No, that wasn't the point! The real issue was, if His Highness left, who would manage this magnificent city? His mind was in turmoil. Would the Duke's children inherit it? It was clear that was impossible. Were they to wait for them to reassemble an army to avenge their father? Was it one of the other five great families, aside from the Lion family, or another noble family?

"That's right," Roland nodded, "I will take the ransom and return to Border Town."

A thought suddenly surged in his heart, and once it appeared, it could no longer be suppressed.

"Your Highness," Petro swallowed, asking in a low voice, "May I ask... is there a 'redemption' value for Longsong Stronghold as well?"
