## Predicament
By the dockside, over a dozen sailboats were lined up, their masts and the interlaced hemp ropes already wrapped in snowflakes forming clean white silver lines. The refugees streamed out of the cabins, flooding towards the open space in front of the dock.



This was not the first time Border Town had received refugees from all over Greycastle, and the whole process was orderly. Four iron railings divided the crowd into two long lines, both controlling the flow of people and preventing stampedes. Police officers holding batons patrolled along the railings, ready to strike anyone who pushed or tried to climb over the barriers. There was punishment, but also reward—to soothe those who had endured hardships to get here, refugees passing through the railing passage were given a bowl of steaming thin porridge. In any case, filling their stomachs first could effectively reduce the refugees' panic and discomfort in a strange land.



This time, besides the police, the First Army, and the municipal officials, Nightingale and Sylvie also participated in the inspections, aiming to weed out the drug addicts that Timothy had planted in the crowd. Under the scrutiny of the Eye of Magic, neither pills nor snow powder could hide.



"Thank you for all you've done for the Western Territory," Roland said, turning his gaze away from the scene to address Margaret, standing beside him, "If it weren't for your fleet, these people might have had to spend the winter in the slums of other cities."



"When Your Highness asked for my help with such urgency, of course I had to do my best," she smiled, "But many sailors were unwilling to set sail in the heavy snow, so we could only gather these thirteen ships."



"It's still better than none at all," Roland exhaled a white breath. Ever since learning that a large number of refugees were stranded in Silver City, Redwater City, and Willow Town, he had sent a letter of assistance to the Margaret Chamber of Commerce, hoping that they could gather a fleet to help transport the refugees.



Although thirteen ships were a small number, running a few extra trips should manage to bring everyone back—if one sailboat could carry a hundred people and a round trip took two weeks, it would take about a month and a half to transport the three thousand stranded people. The gold royals carried by the First Army squad would not last that long, so this return trip would also need to transport food and warm clothing. Roland did not want any refugees to board the ship with hope, only to ultimately not reach their destination.



Thanks to Lightning, Margaret finally set the transportation fee at twice the usual rate. Any other merchant would surely consider this a foolish deal—the freight alone exceeded the value of the goods themselves, and the transportation cost of one gold royal per two people could buy several strong and healthy slaves at the current market price. Margaret had raised her doubts about this, but Roland insisted on bringing these people back to the Western Territory.



From the moment they set foot on the sailboat following the envoy group, they were considered citizens of the Western Territory, and he had a responsibility to provide them with shelter. Moreover, in Roland's eyes, the value of these refugees far exceeded that of slaves. After education, training, and reemployment, the wealth they would create in their new roles would be immeasurable.



Back in the castle's drawing room, Roland instructed the kitchen to serve Margie a bowl of thick soup to ward off the cold. "Drink this, it will warm your hands and feet quite a bit."



"Thank you for your kindness," the female merchant scooped up a spoonful and sniffed, "Does this contain white liquor?"



"Indeed," he smiled, "Besides that, there are peppercorns and honey, with chicken broth as the base." High-proof alcohol is an excellent beverage for driving away the cold at any time, and when heated with chicken broth, it becomes even more aromatic. The seasoning also masks the harsh taste of the alcohol, making the whole bowl of soup fresh, fragrant, and slightly spicy, easy to drink even for those who are not accustomed to alcohol.



After Margie slowly finished the soup, she let out a sigh of relief. "That's really nice. Every time I travel here, I look forward to it, wondering what new and novel things you will come up with. It's just a pity that next year I probably won't be able to visit your territory often."



"Are you talking about trading opportunities?" Roland caught the implication in her words sharply.



The female merchant nodded, "Timothy has already issued an order prohibiting the trade of saltpeter. Now, not only the King's City, but the saltpeter from Silver City and Redwater City is also forbidden to be sold outside, except for being supplied to the Alchemy Association at a low price, it can only be sold to the nobles in the city."



Roland frowned.



"Moreover, according to the information I got through the channels of the city hall, it seems he is planning to completely blockade the Western Territory. I'm afraid it's not just saltpeter, even merchants will be blocked at the line of Redwater City. By then, not only Border Town, but Longsong Stronghold and Willow Town will also be affected. Although many nobles have expressed opposition, Timothy is not likely to withdraw the order." She shook her head helplessly, "By next year, I will not only be unable to transport saltpeter and ore ingots to this place, but even the steam engine trade might also have to be stopped."



It seemed that he had pushed him to the brink, otherwise he would not have resorted to a decree that could equally harm the royal family. Roland couldn't help but think to himself that interfering with the trade of other territories without having completed centralization could easily provoke the resistance of the lords and nobility. Even if Timothy dispatched his own forces to guard the roads and rivers, it would be easy for local lords to undermine him from behind—if he were to enforce this policy for a year or even just half a year.



But trade was the Achilles' heel of Border Town. It couldn't be allowed to be interrupted for a year, let alone half a year. Saltpeter was the raw material for large-scale acid production, and before the artificial synthesis of ammonia was resolved, its importance was irreplaceable. Once the supply was halted, the 152mm artillery would become mere ornaments, and the re-equipment of the new repeating rifles would be delayed significantly.



However, more critical than weapons was the steam engine trade. Currently, the treasury of the town hall did not hold many Gold royals, with part of the earnings being used for infrastructure, constantly increasing job positions, and another part being used to pay the townspeople's wages. These wages would then be recovered through transactions involving food, convenience goods, and housing, forming a cycle. This economic model required a continuous injection of Gold royals into the market, at least equal to the wealth created by the townspeople.



Border Town was still in a state of primitive accumulation and had not issued credit currency. If the trade income from steam engines were to be reduced, the financial situation could easily dry up, unable to pay wages, leading to a complete economic collapse.



Under no circumstances could the interruption of funds be accepted.



"This situation won't last too long," Roland said with a shrug, "I believe you will be able to visit this small western town again soon... no, by then, what you will see will be a brand new city."



Margaret was slightly surprised, "You plan to build a city here?"



"Right after the Evil Months," he smiled, "Also, I plan to open a trade route that directly connects with the Fjords, not through Seawindshire or Clearwater Harbor, but directly from the West, straight to the Fjord Islands. I wonder if you're interested in participating?"
