## Witch from Sleeping Island (Part 1)
The letter also mentioned that Tilly was trying to translate these texts and was wondering if the Mutual Aid Society had any clues.

Roland decided to inform her in his reply about the devil and the Holy City of Taquila, and to send her the photographs of the scene restored by Soraya, which might help with her translation. This kind of information should not be hidden; the sooner they could figure out what happened over four hundred years ago, the sooner they could prepare for it. It might even reveal the Church's weaknesses—if they had nothing to hide, they would not have buried their history underground.

Clearly, there were things they were desperate to keep secret.



Additionally, it would be wise to send someone to investigate the stone tower in the Misty Forest. The ruins in the Eastern Region's Seawindshire were sealed by the Church, and the stone island in the fjords was submerged in seawater all year round, leaving almost nothing but a pile of books in the secret chamber. The depths of the Misty Forest were rarely trodden, even by the Church, so there might be some useful clues to be found there.

However, the devil mentioned in Lightning's report was also a major concern to him. Such an operation could not be conducted without witches, but the potential loss of any witch was something Roland could not bear. After much deliberation, he decided to wait until the army was equipped with the new generation of firearms and then set out for the forest with a group of witches to deal with any possible devils.

Suppressing the unease in his heart, Roland put on a forced smile and said, "I understand Tilly's situation. I will reply to her and explain everything. For now, let's proceed with the ability test."



After all, it was only sensible to strengthen his forces as much as possible during peacetime, so that when the inevitable war came, he would at least have the power to fight.

...

The testing site was chosen outside the town walls, and to prevent refugees from wandering into the testing area, Roland even mobilized the First Army to isolate the surroundings.



The first to undergo the test was Lotus.



She was about the same age as Nightingale, with a head of jet-black curly short hair, delicate features that made her look charming and lovely. She was not tall, only about 1.5 meters, with a slender figure. Compared to the tall and statuesque Nightingale, she seemed like a young girl who had yet to fully develop, exuding a sense of fragility. However, her ability was far from weak; within a range of five meters, she could easily change the terrain under her feet.



The description in the letter was far less shocking than witnessing her ability in person. During the test, Lotus caused the ground beside her to rise vertically, forming what looked like a towering "earth pillar" that almost reached seven or eight meters before it collapsed due to structural instability.



According to her, the looser the ground, the less magical power it took to modify. However, the poorer the quality of the soil, the weaker the strength of the constructed houses and walls. If the ground was mainly composed of sand and gravel, it was difficult to create anything substantial—clearly, she could only alter the terrain, not the material of the earth itself. Of course, this problem could be solved by expanding the area of influence and the thickness.



Roland also had her demonstrate building a house, but the soil of the Western Territory was obviously not as compact as that of Sleeping Island. The mud house that rose from the ground collapsed several times when creating windows and doors, so they had to increase the wall thickness to about half a meter. The finished house was as rudimentary as a cave dwelling, only providing the most basic living functions, far inferior to the orderly layout and compact structure of brick houses.



But then again, even the worst cave dwelling was better than a leaky wooden shack, especially in winter. A single brazier and a mud bed could keep the house warm and toasty. If they couldn't build enough brick houses before the Evil Months arrived, they could make do with these types of houses for the time being.



The final step was a comprehensive assessment—Lotus's ability was a typical summoning type, without any branching abilities. She could shape the terrain within a five-meter radius of herself, and while casting, she was easily affected by the Divine Stone of Judgement, though the terrain that had already been shaped would not shrink back.



"How is her magic power level?" Roland asked.



"A brown cyclone with a very dense center, which is quite good among witches," Nightingale thought for a moment, "It's close to that of Leaf's."



"How fast is the consumption rate?"

"It's manageable when raising the soil ground," she looked toward the stone wall that rose at the foot of the northern slope, "but the magic power drops very quickly when transforming rock. I'm afraid it can only last for one or two hours at most."

Roland nodded. Leaf's magic power was ranked third among the Witch Union, only behind Anna and Soraya, and having sufficient magic power was the prerequisite for sustained use of abilities—of course, there were also low-consumption abilities like those of Nightingale and Lightning, which could be maintained for an entire day without much difficulty.

After recording this information in his notebook, he began testing the second witch.

"Who wants to go next?"

"Me me me!" Honey raised her hand.

Roland curled his lips into a smile, "Then show us your ability."

This girl, known as Honey, was also not very tall, even shorter than Lily, having just reached adulthood last winter. She appeared very lively. Her fluffy brown hair was curled up like twists, her skin a bit darker, and she wore necklaces of beast teeth around her neck, wrists, and ankles.

Her primary ability was 'Beast Speech,' which could affect animals within its range. Various animals tamed by her magic would carry out her commands, but the commands could not exceed the animals' abilities. The taming would end after the completion of the task, or she could end it herself.



Besides, Honey also possesses a very interesting branch ability: animal messengers. She can pass on taming instructions to target animals through messenger animals—for example, summoning a bird to find a more powerful creature to command. It might be an old cat, or perhaps a fierce hawk; the process is completely uncontrollable, and the outcome is full of uncertainty.

However, both the main ability and the branch ability are influenced by the Divine Stone of Judgement, especially the animal messengers, which can have their instructions erased by the Divine Stone of Judgement, freeing the animals. Additionally, the larger the tamed animal, the more magic power it consumes. In her own words, she can summon dozens of birds at the same time, but if the target is a cow, she can only control two or three.



The third person to undergo testing was Evelyn, who was about twenty-five or twenty-six years old, with a standard King's City accent, which sounded particularly cordial.

The list sent by Tilly stated that she could transform inferior beer into other types of alcoholic beverages with completely different styles and flavors, as long as she had tasted them before—for this witch, Roland's initial purpose was quite clear: to distill alcohol. Since she could turn watered-down beer into delicious wine or fruit wine, surely there should be no problem with spirits, right?

For this purpose, Roland carefully prepared several bottles of alcohol, with concentrations ranging from 50% to 95%. It was a bit spicy, but a sip or two shouldn't be a problem. The key was to make her recognize that this throat-burning transparent liquid was indeed a type of alcohol.

However, the scorching outdoor sun was not an ideal place for tasting alcohol, with no delicious side dishes, ice cubes, or crystal wine glasses. Directly presenting the pungent-smelling spirits might lead to misunderstandings that it was poison. He planned to subtly introduce it during dinner, so he simply asked Evelyn a few questions before moving on to the next witch.
