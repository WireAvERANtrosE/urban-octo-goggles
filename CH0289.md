## To the west of the Western Region
Lightning went through her "adventure supplies" again to make sure she had everything. A fire sickle, tinder, bandages, a dagger, a map, and a bag full of rations stuffed with beef jerky.



"What about yours?" she looked at Maggie. "Check yours too."



"Cooh!"



Maggie reached into her shoulder bag—this cloth bag was usually hidden under her fluffy hair, making it hard to see how much it could actually hold. Moreover, when she transformed into a bird, her clothes and shoulder bag seemed to vanish into thin air. Unlike Lightning, whose flight was strictly limited by weight, Maggie didn't seem to be affected as much. The best proof of that was that she pulled out way more stuff than Lightning had.



Jerky, beef floss, chicken legs, fish fillets, eggs—all sorts of food were laid out in front of Lightning.



"Oh my God," she said, holding her forehead, "we're going on an adventure, not to a barbecue in the wild. You should at least carry a weapon."



"Cooh cooh!" Maggie touched her beak.



"You mean to say your beak is your weapon?" Lightning sighed. "If we run into a Judgement Army soldier dressed like a tin can, I'd like to see you peck open his armor! Oh well... It's just for one day anyway, we probably won't encounter any danger. Let's head out."



"Oh! Coo!" The other party instantly transformed into a pigeon, took a couple of running steps, and then flew close to the ground for a good distance before gradually ascending.

Hmm, maybe the weight still affects her.

Lightning pulled down her wind goggles and with a gentle leap, flew to her front.

She remembered the first time she saw Maggie, she was in the southern woodlands engaging in an aerial chase, although at that time the plump pigeon couldn't escape from her grasp; nevertheless, it took some effort to catch her. Now it seems she could catch her in the blink of an eye.

This won't do, having a flying partner is rare, and she would need her help to carry the exploration tools in the future. The girl thought it seems necessary to let her train properly.

"Coo, coo?"

Lightning slowed down to fly side by side with Maggie, "Speak properly!"

"I was asking, where are we going to explore, coo?" the pigeon asked, opening and closing its beak.

"The very west of the Misty Forest, I want to see how big this forest really is," Lightning pulled out the map and spread it open, pointing to the blank area on the west side, "and while at it, fill in this part. We might even see where the Redwater River comes from."



After Maggie returned from the fjords, she immediately began preparing for this expedition. After all, His Highness wouldn't mind where they flew during their free practice. Moreover, the little girl had a secret that she hadn't told anyone—she no longer dared to venture into the forest alone.

For an explorer, this was a disgrace.

But she couldn't deceive herself, the trip to the stone tower made her fear the profound forest. The mere thought of those terrifying monsters possibly hiding somewhere in the forest made her uncontrollably want to flee as quickly as possible.

Fortunately, she was still the daughter of the greatest explorer.

Thunder had once mentioned to her a way to overcome fear, which was to approach it bit by bit, then observe and understand it. Eventually, she would find that 'fear' wasn't so frightening after all.

Because it was a barrier that stemmed from the heart.

This expedition was Lightning's attempt. With Maggie's company, she felt at least a bit more confident. The route she chose was also very safe, heading westward along the Redwater River, not venturing deep into the forest. This way, it was unlikely to encounter any devils. Once she had flown this route, she would try it alone next time. She believed that one day, she would map the entire Western Territory by herself and step into the stone tower again, uncovering the truth of the Holy City, Taquila.

...

All the way, Lightning kept her speed at around sixty kilometers per hour. She could now precisely control her speed by adjusting the amount of magic she released. With the current consumption, she could keep flying for an entire day.



Flying along the river and the edge of the forest also made her a lot more relaxed. Compared to the last time she searched for the stone tower, when everything within her field of view was a dark green blur, making it hard to differentiate direction and height, and felt gloomy and oppressive; now there was a glittering silver ribbon, accompanied by Maggie's constant chirping beside her ear, Lightning felt her fear gradually receding.



"Look, there's a mountain ahead, coo!"



Lightning saw it too, the incomparable mountain—despite the great distance, its gray silhouette already spoke of its loftiness. At the same time, the hilly area on the side of the river was rapidly diminishing, the mountain peaks near the sea seemed to be gathering from the inland, getting closer and closer to the Redwater River, until they were completely joined with the silver ribbon.



"This mountain is a bit too big," she couldn't help but marvel. As the distance shortened, the outline of the mountain became clearer. Its summit was snow-white, as if piercing straight into the clouds. Though not as long and undulating as the Impassable Mountain Range for thousands of miles, in terms of height, it was taller than three or four Impassable Mountains put together. The hills to the south were just an extension of it, and the source of the Redwater River also came from this majestic mountain.



"The Misty Forest is coming to an end, coo!" Maggie exclaimed excitedly.



Below, the dark green patch had finally ended, and the earth had returned to a light green—a grassland, probably. But further ahead, within their field of view, it turned into a pitch-black swath that extended all the way to the foot of the high mountain.



"Let's go down and take a look." Lightning gestured with her hand and dived toward the dark land. She quickly discovered that it was a surface made up of black stones.



"What is this?" Maggie landed and pecked at it twice, "Seems like it can't be eaten, coo!"



"Of course it can't be eaten," Lightning picked up a black stone and examined it closely. It had edges and angles, and though it appeared pitch-black, when rotated in the sunlight, one could see a metallic luster. Such stones were everywhere, mixed with the sparse dirt, and at first glance, it looked as if the earth had been soaked in ink. "This might be some kind of ore, let's take a couple of pieces back for His Highness to see."



Next came the task of drawing maps. She returned to the sky and began to record the nearby terrain in detail.

It took most of the morning to reach the foot of the towering mountains from Border Town, which meant that this place was about two hundred and forty kilometers away from the town, much farther than Longsong Stronghold. And this mountain... A thought suddenly popped into Lightning's mind. What kind of scene lay behind such a massive peak? Was it a vast forest, or rolling hills and mountains?

Once fear receded, the idea became difficult to suppress.

Crossing the mountain was clearly challenging; the sheer white snow capping the summit was daunting enough to make anyone think twice. But there was another route, one that involved circling around from the sea. In fact, she didn't even have to go behind the mountain; she could just fly diagonally towards the center of the sea to get a view from behind the mountain.

Lightning called over Maggie, warning her not to move about carelessly. Then she put on her wind goggles and instantly increased her speed to the limit—the magic power rapidly vented out, the headwind blew her short hair all back to the nape of her neck, the land kept receding, and the blue ocean filled her entire field of vision.

After flying like this for about half an hour, she could faintly make out the scene beyond the mountains. It seemed that there was also a continuous range of mountains separating the sea from the land to the rear, but then Lightning saw something that made her blood freeze.

At the edge of her vision, a layer of reddish-brown fog blanketed the mountains, thick as blood that would not dissipate. The fog continued to spread westward, with almost no end in sight.
