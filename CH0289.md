## Western Region to the west
Lightning took out her "adventuring gear" to check it once again.

Fire sickle, tinder, bandages, dagger, map, and a bag of dried food stuffed with beef jerky.

"How about yours?" she looked at Maggie, "Check yours too."

"Coo!"

Maggie reached into her shoulder bag—this cloth bag was usually hidden under her fluffy hair, making it difficult to see how much stuff could be stuffed inside. Moreover, when she transformed into a bird, her clothes and shoulder bag seemed to vanish into thin air. Unlike Lightning, whose flight was strictly limited by weight, Maggie did not seem to be affected much, which was evident by the fact that she pulled out much more stuff than Lightning.

Beef jerky, shredded beef, chicken legs, fish fillets, eggs—a pile of food was laid out in front of Lightning.

"Oh my," she said, holding her forehead, "we're going on an adventure, not a field barbecue. At least bring a weapon."

"Coo coo!" Maggie touched her own beak.

"Are you saying your beak is a weapon?" Lightning sighed, "If we encounter a Judgement Army soldier armored like a tin can, I doubt you could peck open his armor! Ah, forget it... It's just for one day, we probably won't encounter any danger. Let's set out."



"Oh! Coo!" The other party instantly turned into a pigeon, took a couple of running steps, skimmed the ground for a good distance before slowly ascending.

Hmm, maybe the weight still affects her.

Lightning pulled down her wind goggles and with a light leap, she flew to her front.

She remembered the first time she met Maggie, she herself was in the southern woodlands engaging in an aerial chase. Although at that time the fat pigeon couldn't escape from the palm of her hand, it still took some effort to catch her. Now, it seems she could catch her in the blink of an eye.

This won't do, it's rare to have a flying partner, and in the future, she would rely on her to carry exploration tools. The young girl thought that it seemed necessary to let her train properly.

"Coo, coo?"

Lightning slowed down and flew alongside Maggie, "Speak properly!"

"I was asking, where are we going to explore, coo?" the pigeon opened and closed its beak.

"To the farthest west of the Misty Forest, I want to see just how big this forest really is," Lightning pulled out a map and spread it out, pointing to the blank area on the west side, "and to fill in this part while we're at it. Maybe we'll even see where the Redwater River comes from."



After returning from the fjord, Maggie immediately began preparing for the expedition. Since His Highness wouldn't mind where they flew during free practice anyway. Moreover, the little girl had a secret she had not told the others—she no longer dared to adventure in the forest alone.

For an explorer, this was a great shame.

But she couldn't deceive herself; the journey to the Stone Tower had instilled a fear of the deep forest within her. The thought of the terrifying monsters that might be lurking somewhere in the forest made her uncontrollably want to escape as quickly as possible.

Fortunately, she was still the daughter of the greatest explorer.

Lightning had once mentioned to her a method to overcome fear, which was to approach it little by little, then observe and understand it, to eventually realize that 'fear' was not so frightening after all.

Because it originated from an obstacle within one's heart.

This expedition was Lightning's attempt, and with Maggie's company, she felt at least a bit more confident. The chosen route was also very safe, heading west along the Redwater River, without venturing deep into the forest, thus it was unlikely to encounter devils. After flying this route, she would try it alone the next time. She believed that one day, she would map the entire Western Territory by herself and once again step into the Stone Tower to unveil the truth of the Holy City of Taquila.

...

Throughout the journey, Lightning kept her speed around sixty kilometers per hour. She could now precisely control her speed by adjusting the amount of magic released. With her current consumption rate, she could sustain flight for an entire day.



Flying along the river and the edge of the forest made it much easier for her. Unlike the last time she was searching for the stone tower, her entire field of view was a dark green, unable to distinguish direction or altitude, giving off a gloomy and oppressive feeling; now with a glittering silver ribbon and Maggie's constant chirping in her ears, Lightning felt her fear gradually fading away.

"Look, there's a mountain ahead, coo!"

Lightning also saw the incomparable mountain—despite the distance, its grey silhouette already spoke of its majesty. At the same time, the hillsides by the river rapidly diminished, the peaks near the sea seemed to gather inland, drawing closer and closer to the Redwater River, until they were completely adjacent to the silver band.

"This mountain is a bit too big." She couldn't help but marvel. As the distance shortened, the mountain's contours became clearer. Its summit was snow-white, almost piercing into the clouds. Although it was not as continuous as the Impassable Mountain Range that stretched for thousands of miles, in terms of height, it was taller than three or four Impassable Mountains combined. The hills to the south were just an extension of it, and the source of the Redwater River also originated from this majestic mountain.

"The Misty Forest is coming to an end, coo!" Maggie exclaimed excitedly.

Below, the dark green patch finally came to an end, and the earth returned to a lighter green—it must be a grassland. But further ahead, within their field of vision, it turned into a swath of pitch black, stretching all the way to the foot of the high mountain.

"Let's go down and take a look." Lightning gestured with her hand and dove toward the dark land. She quickly discovered that it was a surface made up of black stones.

"What is this?" Maggie landed and pecked at it twice, "Seems like it can't be eaten, coo!"

"Of course not," Lightning picked up a black stone and examined it closely. It had edges and corners, and though it appeared pitch black, it reflected a metallic luster when turned in the sunlight. Such stones were everywhere, mixed with the sparse soil, making the ground look as if it had been soaked in ink. "This might be some kind of ore. Let's take a couple of pieces back for His Highness to see."



Next was the mapping work. She returned to the skies and began to meticulously record the nearby terrain.



It took almost the entire morning to travel from Border Town to the base of the towering mountains, which meant that this place was about 240 kilometers away from the town, much farther than Longsong Stronghold. And this mountain... A thought suddenly surfaced in Lightning's mind as she was amidst the clouds: what kind of scenery lay behind such a massive peak? Was it an expanse of dense forest, or was it rolling hills and mountain ranges?



Once the fear receded, this idea became unstoppable.



Crossing the mountain obviously posed some difficulties; just the sight of the peak's pure white snow was enough to deter anyone. But there was another route: to circle around from the sea. She didn't even have to go behind the mountain; if she just flew diagonally towards the center of the sea, she could cast her gaze behind the mountain.



Lightning called over Maggie and instructed her not to move rashly. Then, after putting on her wind goggles, she instantly accelerated to her top speed—the magical power rapidly depleted as the gale hit her face, blowing all her short hair back, the land receded behind her, and the blue ocean filled her entire field of vision.



After flying like this for about half an hour, she could vaguely make out the scenery beyond the mountains. It seemed that there were continuous mountain ranges separating the sea from the land behind as well, but what Lightning saw next made her blood run cold.



At the edge of her vision, a layer of reddish-brown fog blanketed the mountain tops, thick like blood that would not dissolve, spreading endlessly westward, almost without any visible limit.
