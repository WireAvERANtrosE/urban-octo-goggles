## Witch Anna (Part 1)
In the following days, he locked himself in his room, thoroughly recalling the world he was in, with his meals being delivered directly by the servants.

With the strong desire to survive, Roland suppressed his fear and discomfort towards the unfamiliar environment after crossing over. He knew very well that the sooner he could grasp more information, the lower the risk of exposure would be.

It had to be said, aside from mingling with the young nobles, there wasn't much else in the Fourth Prince's head. Roland turned his memories over and over but couldn't recall any valuable information—such as noble encounters, political situations, or diplomacy with neighboring countries. As for some basic knowledge, like city names and important event dates, he was equally unable to reconcile them with the European history he knew.

It seemed that this person was absolutely out of the running for the throne. Perhaps the King of Greycastle knew this too, which is why he had been sent to such a forsaken place—with the idea that even if he acted recklessly, he wouldn't be able to cause much harm.

And those brothers and sisters... Roland thought about them for a moment and could only express a bitter smile.

The eldest brother was strong, the second brother was very cunning, the third sister was ferocious, and the youngest sister was too smart. These were the impressions the Fourth Prince had left behind. What could he say? After more than a decade of living together, the final impression was summed up in just a few words. He had no idea what forces they had cultivated, who their capable subordinates were, or what they were good at.

Having been in Border Town for only three months, the nobles here no longer hid their contempt, which showed that the Fourth Prince really wasn't leadership material. Fortunately, when leaving the royal capital, King Wimbledon III had provided him with one civil and one military assistant to help him, otherwise he would've been completely in the dark.

The next morning, the maid Tyra reminded Roland several times that the ministerial aide wanted to see him. It seemed he couldn't delay it any further. He followed the usual practice from his memories, groped the maid's buttocks twice, and told her to inform Barov to wait for him in the reception room.

Watching Tyra walk out the door with a flushed face, Roland suddenly wondered if, since this was like farming, there might be a system or something included? He yawned and repeated 'system' in his mind dozens of times, but nothing happened.



Indeed, novels are deceiving.

...

Barov, who had been waiting anxiously in the parlor, could hardly sit still. As soon as he saw Roland appear, he hurried forward, "Your Highness, why didn't you order the execution by hanging yesterday?"



"What's the difference between a day sooner or a day later," Roland clapped his hands, instructing the servant to serve breakfast, "Sit down and we'll talk."



It seems he matches the memory I have of him, he thought. The Chief Knight always prefers to question things face to face, while the Minister Assistant tends to explain things privately. Anyway, their loyalty to me is reliable—although it is most likely for the king's sake.



"Delaying it by a day might attract other witches, Prince!" Barov exclaimed. "This is not like those trivial matters before; you can't act on a whim!"



"Why are you talking about this too?" Roland frowned, "I thought you could distinguish between rumors and facts."



Barov looked utterly confused, "What rumors?"



"The evil witches, the messengers of the devil," Roland said dismissively, "Isn't that all propaganda from the Church? To keep them from interfering here, I think it's better to do the opposite. They claim witches are evil, so we will not hunt witches and will even proclaim to the people in our domain that these are shameless rumors spread by the Church."



Barov was stunned, "But... but witches indeed..."



"Indeed evil?" Roland countered, "For example?"



The assistant minister fell silent for a moment, as if considering whether the prince was deliberately making fun of him, "Your Highness, this kind of question can be discussed later. I know that you dislike the Church, but this way of opposition will only backfire."



It seemed that changing ingrained perceptions was not something that could be achieved overnight. Roland curled his lips but did not continue to dwell on this point.



Breakfast was served at this time: a plate of fried bread slices, a plate of fried eggs, and a pitcher of milk. He first poured a cup for the assistant minister and pushed it towards him.



"You haven't had breakfast yet, have you? Let's talk while eating." According to the maid's words, Barov had rushed to the palace gates at dawn to request an audience and probably had not eaten anything yet. Although he had decided to first emulate the ways of the Fourth Prince, changes had to be made little by little. The assistant minister was a good target, he thought; making your subordinates feel valued by you gives them more motivation to serve you.



Subjective initiative has always been the most efficient, hasn't it?



Barov took the cup but did not drink. He said anxiously, "Your Highness, we have trouble. Three days ago, the guards reported that they found a suspected witch's camp in the western forest. They left in a hurry and did not clean up any traces. The guards found this in the camp."



He took out a coin from his bosom and placed it in front of Roland.



"That's not a common currency, at least not in Roland's memory; he had never seen such currency—it didn't even resemble a metal product.

Holding it in his hand, he was surprised to find that the object was heating up, definitely not just the residual warmth from the minister's aide; it was at least over forty degrees, which instantly reminded him of a hand warmer.

"What is this?"

"I originally thought it was just a nefarious object created by a witch, but the matter is more serious than I had anticipated," Barov wiped his forehead, "The pattern on it... is the Holy Mountain and the Eye of Magic, it's the sigil of the Witch Cooperation Association."

Roland caressed the uneven surface of the coin, guessing that it was probably made from ceramic firing. At the center of the coin, there indeed was a "mountain" shaped pattern—three triangles in parallel, with an eye in the center of the triangles. The outline of the pattern was very rough, likely hand-polished.

He recalled the terms "Holy Mountain and the Eye of Magic" and "Witch Cooperation Association," but couldn't find any relevant information. It seemed that the Fourth Prince had not invested any points in the study of the occult.

Barov didn't expect Roland to know, and he continued, "Your Highness, you have not seen a real witch, that's why you take them lightly. Indeed, they can be injured, they can bleed, they are not harder to kill than any of us ordinary people, but that's for witches who cannot resist. Witches who have received the Devil's call have a very short lifespan, but they also acquire terrifying powers that ordinary people simply cannot contend with. Once a witch reaches adulthood, even an army would have to pay a heavy price. Their desires are almost impossible to suppress, and they ultimately fall into the claws of the devil as minions."

"That's why the Church has established the Judgement Army, if a woman is found who might turn into a witch, she can be arrested and executed. The King also agrees with this, in fact, these measures have been very effective, and witch ravaging incidents have been much less than a hundred years ago. The rumors of the Holy Mountain, or rather the Gates of Hell, originated from ancient books of that era."

Roland nibbled on his bread, his heart sneering continuously. Although the background of this world was drastically different from what he knew, the trajectory of its historical development was still startlingly similar. The Church, always the Church, he knew that religion was the real claw of the devil, the true source of sin. Execute on suspicion? To write laws, apprehend, put into trial, and execute in the name of God, that itself was a form of corruption. The Prince's memories of the Church's abuse of power also validated his own views.



According to ancient texts, witches can only find true peace by journeying to the Holy Mountain. There, they would not suffer from the backlash of magic, nor be trapped by surging desires. Without a doubt, the so-called Holy Mountain mentioned in the books must be the origin of evil, the gateway from the human realm to hell. I think only hell would not punish these fallen ones.



What about the Witch Cooperation Association? What does it have to do with the Holy Mountain?



Barov grimaced as he spoke, "Previously, whether witches fled or went into hiding, they acted alone. But the Cooperation Association that emerged in recent years is different; they want to gather all the witches together to search for the Holy Mountain. For this purpose, members of the Association would even actively lure others into becoming witches. Wasn't there a case of infant girls going missing collectively in Clearwater Harbor last year? Rumors have it that they were behind it."
