## Witch Anna (Part 1)
For the next period of time, he confined himself to his room, thoroughly recalling this world, with his meals being directly delivered by servants.
Under the strong desire to survive, Roland suppressed the fear and discomfort of the unfamiliar environment after transiting. He was very clear in his mind that mastering more information sooner could reduce the risk of exposure.
It must be said that aside from messing around with those young nobles, there was nothing else in the Fourth Prince's head. Roland turned his memories over and over but couldn't recall any valuable information—such as noble encounters, political situations, diplomatic relations with neighboring countries. As for some basic knowledge, like city names and major event years, he was equally unable to connect them with the European history he knew.
It seemed this guy was absolutely out of the running for the throne. Perhaps the King of Greycastle was aware of this too, which is why he was dumped in such a godforsaken place—where even if he behaved recklessly, he wouldn't cause much damage.
And those brothers and sisters... Roland could only laugh and cry upon slight recollection.
The eldest brother was strong, the second brother was very sinister, the third sister was fierce enough to kill, and the fifth sister was too smart. These were the impressions left by the Fourth Prince. What should he say? After more than a decade of living together, in the end, the impressions were summarized in just a few words. He had no idea about the forces they had cultivated, who their capable subordinates were, or what they were good at.
Having been in Border Town for only three months, the local nobles no longer hid their disdain, which showed that the Fourth Prince really wasn't leadership material. Fortunately, when leaving the royal capital, King Wimbledon III had provided him with one civil and one military aide, otherwise, he would have been completely in the dark.
The next morning, the maid Tyra reminded Roland several times that the minister's assistant wanted to see him. It seemed he couldn't delay any longer, so following the usual practice he remembered, he patted the maid's bottom twice and told her to inform Barov to wait in the reception room.
Watching Tyra walk out the door with a flushed face, Roland suddenly wondered if, since he was kind of "farming," there might be a system involved? He yawned and repeated 'system' dozens of times in his mind, but nothing happened.
As expected, novels are deceiving.
...
Barov, who had been waiting anxiously in the reception room, immediately approached Roland when he appeared, "Your Highness, why did you not order the execution to be carried out yesterday?"
"What's the difference if it's a day earlier or later," Roland clapped his hands, instructing the attendants to serve breakfast, "Sit down and talk slowly."
It seemed to match the impression in his memory, he thought. The Chief Knight always liked to question him face to face when encountering problems, while the minister's assistant would explain things to him in private. Anyway, their loyalty to him was still reliable—although it was very likely out of respect for the King.
"Delaying by a day could attract other witches, Prince! This is different from those minor matters before, you can't just do as you please!"
"Why are you saying this too?" Roland frowned, "I thought you could tell the difference between rumors and facts."

Barov looked perplexed. "What rumors?"

"The evil witch, the messenger of the devil," Roland said nonchalantly, "aren't these the propaganda of the church? To keep them from interfering here, I think it's better to do the opposite. They claim that witches are evil, so we will not hunt witches, and we will propagate among the people of the territory that these are shameless rumors spread by the church."

Barov was stunned. "But... the witches indeed..."

"Are indeed evil?" Roland countered. "For example?"

The Minister's Assistant fell silent for a moment, as if wondering whether the prince was deliberately teasing him. "Your Highness, we can discuss this matter later. I know you don't like the church, but this kind of opposition will only backfire."

It seemed that changing entrenched views wasn't something that could be achieved overnight. Roland pursed his lips but didn't press the issue.

Breakfast was then served on the table—a plate of fried bread, a dish of fried eggs, and a can of milk. He poured a cup for the Minister's Assistant and pushed it towards him.

"You haven't eaten yet, have you? Let's talk while we eat." According to the maids, Barov had arrived at the palace gates at dawn to request an audience, so he probably hadn't eaten anything yet. Although he decided to first imitate the ways of the Fourth Prince, change had to start gradually. The Minister's Assistant was a good target, he thought, as making subordinates feel valued would motivate them to serve you better.

After all, isn't subjective initiative the most efficient?

Barov took the cup but did not drink. He said anxiously, "Your Highness, we have trouble. Three days ago, the guards reported that they found a camp in the western forest where suspected witches had stayed overnight. They left in a hurry and didn't clean up any traces. The guards found this in the camp."

He took out a coin from his chest and placed it in front of Roland.

It was not a common currency, at least Roland had no memory of such a coin—it didn't even look like a metal product.

Holding it in his hand, he was surprised to find that it was warm, definitely not just the residual warmth from the Minister's Assistant's body; the temperature was at least above forty degrees. This instantly reminded him of hand warmers.

"What is this?"

"I thought it was just some evil thing made by a witch, but the matter is more serious than I thought," Barov wiped his forehead. "The pattern on it... is the emblem of the Holy Mountain and the Eye of Magic. It's the sign of the Witch Cooperation Association."

Roland stroked the uneven surface of the coin, guessing that it was probably made of ceramic. In the center of the coin, there was indeed a "mountain" pattern—three triangles side by side, with an eye in the middle of the triangles. The outline of the pattern was very rough, likely hand-polished.

He recalled the two terms, "Holy Mountain and the Magic Eye" and "Witch Cooperation Association," but found no relevant information. It seemed that the Fourth Prince had zero points in the field of mysticism.

Barov did not expect Roland to know, and he continued, "Your Highness, you have not seen a real witch, hence you underestimate them. Indeed, they can be injured, they can bleed, and are not harder to kill than us ordinary people, but that's when the witches cannot resist. Witches who have heeded the devil's call will have a very short lifespan, but they will also gain terrifying powers that ordinary people simply cannot compete with. Once a witch comes of age, even an army will pay a heavy price. Their desires are almost impossible to suppress, and they ultimately fall into the clutches of the devil."

"The Church, therefore, formed the Judgment Army, which can arrest and execute any woman suspected of turning into a witch. The King also agrees with this, and in fact, these measures have been very effective, with incidents of witches running rampant being much less than a hundred years ago. The rumors of the Holy Mountain, or rather the Gates of Hell, come from ancient books of that era."

Roland nibbled on his bread and sneered inwardly. Although the background of this world was quite different from what he knew, the trajectory of historical development was still strikingly similar. The Church, it was always the Church; he knew that religion was the true claw of the devil, the real source of evil. Execution upon discovery? To combine lawmaking, enforcement, judgment, and execution all in the name of God was corruption itself. The Prince's memory of the Church's abuse of power also validated his view.

"The ancient books record that only by going to the Holy Mountain can a witch find true peace. There, they will not suffer from the backlash of magic, nor be trapped by surging desires. Without a doubt, the so-called Holy Mountain in the books is definitely the source of evil, the gateway from the human world to hell. I think only hell would not punish these fallen ones."

"What about the Witch Cooperation Association? What does it have to do with the Holy Mountain?"

Barov said with a pained expression, "Previously, whether witches fled or secluded themselves, they acted alone. But the Cooperation Association that has emerged in recent years is different; it aims to gather all witches together to find the Holy Mountain. For this purpose, the people from the Cooperation Association would even actively lure others into becoming witches. Wasn't there a case of infant girls going missing in Clearwater Harbor last year? Rumors have it that they were behind it."
