## Rage
The lord's castle of Border Town was not originally built where it is now. Initially, when laying the stone wall foundations, they encountered underground caves, and the ground suddenly collapsed, forcing them to change the location. The water channels that had been dug were mostly destroyed in the collapse, and even those that remained intact were abandoned because of the relocation.

As a young boy, Brian often explored these tunnels. One day, he discovered a route that could lead from an abandoned well to the water well in the castle garden. Brian told his father about this discovery, only to be hung up and severely beaten. His father warned him that trespassing into the lord's castle was a capital offense, punishable by hanging if discovered. Scared, Brian naturally never walked through this waterway again, but when people gathered together to drink and chat, he had bragged more than once about his ability to reach the castle directly. Now he deeply regretted it.

Apart from Greyhound, there were nine people in the group. In other words, the whole patrol team was persuaded by Scarface - serving Duke Ryan, the lord of the kingdom's western territory, with such generous rewards, few people could resist such temptation.

The abandoned well was located where the initial collapse had taken place, and it was still a wasteland. Brian was prodded down the well by Scarface’s sword, sandwiched in the middle of the group. The once spacious waterway seemed very narrow now. Due to years of disuse and diversion of water flow, many places in the cave had grown vines.

The guy who killed Greyhound was walking in front with a torch, holding a short-handled axe to clear the obstacles. Brian pretended to remember the way, but deep down he was considering an escape plan.

Clearly, in such an inconvenient location, he had no chance of escape. Only when they arrived at the castle might he have a slim chance. What should he do then? Shout loudly to attract the attention of His Highness's personal guards? No, no... Scarface could end his life with a simple raise of his hand. He had to create distance first, otherwise he would end up like Greyhound.

Thinking of Greyhound, the light in Brian's eyes dimmed even more.

Before Border Town was established, he and Greyhound had lived here, almost growing up together, and joining the patrol team had been Brian's idea. Unexpectedly, like him, Greyhound was also elected as the captain of the patrol team.

Brian had been happy for him for a long time. Because of his stutter, Greyhound had always been looked down upon. Now, he finally had the opportunity to be recognized - at least that's what Brian thought at the time.

But when Greyhound fell, and Brian roared at Scarface in anger, Scarface told him with a sarcastic face the reason why they had chosen Greyhound and himself as captains.

"Idiot, the patrol captain has to stay until the Evil Months to light the warning beacon. If we don't do it, should I risk it?" 

His words stabbed into Brian's heart like a sharp blade.

So all those humility... all those congratulations were hypocritical illusions, the real reason was so ugly and unbearable. He wore a shocked and desperate expression to hide the rage surging in his heart. It was unforgivable, Brian gritted his teeth secretly, someone must pay the price for this!

After about half an hour of traversing through the dried-up underground waterway, they finally heard the sound of flowing water.

This meant that they were not far from their destination.

Turning a corner, the front immediately became much clearer, big enough to accommodate two people standing side by side. The person at the front of the line said, "There's no way forward, it's a vertical well."

"What's going on?" Scarface poked with his sword and asked.

"Tell him to look up," Brian said in a deep voice, "We've arrived."

This abandoned waterway was directly connected to the middle of the well in the castle's backyard. At the time of repair, due to an oversight, this interface was not sealed. Scarface leaned against the well wall and looked down. Three feet below him was rushing water, and above his head, he could see a small circle of night sky.

He had someone keep an eye on Brian, took out a bundle of rope from his backpack, tied the hook securely, and lightly threw it up. With a clanging sound, the hook was firmly stuck at the edge of the well mouth.

Scarface climbed out carefully along the rope. Very quickly, he tugged on the rope from above, signaling for the others to follow.

It took the group half a day's effort to climb out of the well. The castle, which they could only gaze at from afar, was now standing right in front of them.

Scarface grabbed Brian and growled, "Lead us to the warehouse quickly."

Brian had only been here once before, and although his memory of the castle was hazy, he led the group silently, prying open the lock of the wooden door nearest to the well, and sneaking into the castle. 

By this time, most of the people in the castle were asleep, and the oil lamps hanging on the corridor walls had all been extinguished. In the pitch-black darkness, someone in the team lit a torch. The faint light barely illuminated a few feet around them. Brian knew his opportunity had arrived. 

When the team reached a fork leading to the basement, he aimed at the stairs extending downward and pounced. Despite the person next to Brian always keeping an eye on him, his leap was too quick. Before they could react, that person grunted and was knocked down the stairs. 

Falling down the stairs, the two instantly moved out of the range of the torchlight, disappearing into the darkness. 

"Damn it, the nerve!" Furious Scar immediately drew his dagger and chased after them. He had thought that Brian would use the darkness to play hide and seek, but to his surprise, Brian hadn't run away. Instead, he was standing quietly at the bottom of the stairs, as if waiting for him. 

Furious Scar noticed his comrade who had been knocked down was lying motionless on the ground. In Brian's hand was that man's weapon. 

"Fool, do you think you stand a chance?" Furious Scar held his guard, waiting for the others to descend before he spoke loudly, "There are seven of us, and only one of you." 

Brian didn't answer, no longer needing to suppress his rage. Raising his sword, he struck a swift and heavy blow on Furious Scar's blade, and sparks flew. Before the other could pose for the next round, his thrust had already pierced Furious Scar's shoulder!

Furious Scar let out a painful roar, stumbling backwards. Another person stepped forward, blocking Brian's pursuit.

This was an excellent place for a counterattack, the narrow corridor wouldn't allow the opponents to take advantage of their numbers. All he had to do was stand in the middle of the corridor and face them head-on, the opponents would be left with no strategy—there wasn't room for two people to swing their weapons side by side. 

In terms of swordsmanship, Brian was confident he wouldn't lose to anyone in the Patrol Team. 

While these scumbags lazed around, gambled, and drowned themselves in bars, he was still honing his combat skills, through wind and frost, rain and snow, never breaking for several years—this was also the reason why he chose not to call for help immediately. 

He wanted to personally avenge Grayhound.
