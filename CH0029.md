## Fury
The castle of Border Town's lord was not initially built at its current location.

When they first started laying the stone wall foundation, they encountered an underground cavern, causing the ground to suddenly collapse, which forced them to move the location.

Most of the already dug channels were destroyed in the collapse, and even those that were intact were abandoned due to the relocation.

Brian often crawled through these tunnels in his youth, and one day he accidentally discovered a route that led from an abandoned well to the castle garden's water well. Brian told his father about this, but as a result, he was hoisted up and severely beaten. His father warned him that trespassing into the lord's castle was a capital offense, and if discovered, the gallows awaited.

Scared out of his wits, Brian naturally never went through that channel again, but when people gathered together to drink and chat, he boasted more than once about his ability to reach the castle directly. Now he deeply regretted it.

In addition to Greyhound, there were nine people in the group. That is to say, the entire patrol team had been persuaded by Scarface—serving the master of the Western Region of the kingdom, Duke Lion, with such rich rewards, there were not many who could resist such temptation.

The abandoned well was located where the initial collapse occurred, and it is still a wasteland now. Brian was prodded with a sword by Scarface and was forced down the well, sandwiched in the middle of the group. The channels, which had been spacious enough in his childhood, now seemed very narrow. Due to years of disuse and the rerouting of water, many places in the tunnel had overgrown with vines.

The guy who had killed Greyhound held a torch and walked bent over at the front. He held a short-handled axe to clear the obstacles.

Pretending to recall the path, Brian's mind was actually racing with plans to escape.



Clearly, in such an inconvenient place for movement, he had no chance of escape. Only upon reaching the castle might he obtain a glimmer of opportunity. What to do then? Cry out twice to summon the prince's personal guards? No, no... With just a raise of Scarface's hand, he could end his own life, and he must first create distance, otherwise, his fate would be the same as Grayhound’s.



Thinking of Grayhound, Brian's gaze dimmed a few shades.



Before Border Town was established, he and Grayhound had lived here, playing together since they were kids, and it was also Brian's idea to join the patrol team together. Unexpectedly, like himself, Grayhound was elected as the captain of the patrol team.



Brian had been happy for a long time because of this. Due to his stutter, Grayhound had always been subject to contempt. Now, he finally had the chance to be recognized—at least, that's what Brian thought at the time.



But when Grayhound fell, and Brian roared at Scarface, Scarface told him with a face full of sarcasm the reason why everyone recommended them as captains.



"Idiot, the patrol captain has to stay behind during the Evil Months, to light the beacon and sound the alarm. If you don't do it, do you think I'm going to risk my neck?"



That sentence pierced Brian's heart like a blade.



So all those concessions... those congratulations were just a hypocritical façade, the true reason was so ugly and unbearable. He put on a shocked and desperate look to cover up the surging anger in his heart. Unforgivable, Brian gritted his teeth in secret, someone must pay the price!



After walking through the dried-up underground water channel for about half an hour, everyone finally heard the sound of flowing water.



This meant that they were not far from their destination.

Turning a corner, the space in front of them suddenly opened up, allowing two people to stand side by side. The person at the front of the line said, "There's no more road ahead, it's a vertical shaft."

"What's going on?" Scarface asked, jabbing with his sword.

"Tell him to look up," Brian said in a low voice. "We're here."

The abandoned aqueduct connected right in the middle of the castle's backyard well. It might have been an oversight during the repairs that this junction was not sealed off. Scarface leaned against the well wall and peered out. Three feet below his feet was the rushing water, and above his head, he could see a small circle of the night sky.

He had someone watch Brian while he pulled out a bundle of rope from his backpack, tied the hook securely, and gently tossed it upward. With a clang, the hook was firmly caught on the edge of the well mouth.

Scarface climbed out carefully along the rope. Quickly, he tugged on the rope from above, signaling for the people behind to follow.

It took quite some effort for the line of people to climb out of the well. The castle that they could only look at from a distance was now standing right before them.

Scarface grabbed Brian and growled, "Hurry up and take us to the warehouse."



Brian had only been here once before, and although the memory of the castle was already hazy, he still led everyone quietly. He pried open the lock of the wooden door closest to the well and sneaked into the castle.



By this time, most people inside the castle had already fallen asleep, and the oil lamps hanging on the corridor walls were all extinguished. In the pitch-black darkness where one couldn't see their own fingers in front of them, someone in the group lit a tinder. The faint light could only illuminate a few feet around them, and Brian knew that the opportunity he had been waiting for had come.



When the group reached a fork that led to the basement, he targeted the stairs extending downward and pounced. The person guarding Brian had been watching his movements all along, but the leap was too fast, and before he could react, he grunted and tumbled down with Brian.



Falling down the stairs, the two instantly left the range of the tinder's light and disappeared into the darkness.



"Damn it, hell!" Scarface immediately drew his short sword and leaped down in pursuit. He had thought that Brian would use the darkness to play a game of hide and seek with him, but unexpectedly, Brian did not run away and stood quietly at the bottom of the stairs, as if waiting for him.



Scarface noticed that the comrade who had been knocked down was already lying motionless on the ground. And in Brian's hand was that man's weapon.



"Fool, do you think you stand a chance?" Scarface maintained a defensive posture and only after the others came down did he speak harshly, "We still have seven people, and you're all alone."



Brian did not answer; he no longer needed to suppress his rage. He raised his sword and made a diagonal slash as fast as lightning, striking hard on Scarface's sword edge, sending sparks flying. Before his opponent could assume the next stance, Brian's thrust had already driven the sword tip into Scarface's shoulder!



Scarface screamed in pain and stumbled backward, while another person stepped forward, blocking Brian's pursuit.



This is an excellent place for an ambush; the narrow passageway prevents the enemy from exploiting their numerical advantage. All he had to do was stand in the middle of the corridor to face the enemy head-on, and they would be left with no recourse—there was no room for two people to wield their weapons side by side.



In terms of swordsmanship, Brian was confident he would not lose to any member of the patrol team.



While those scumbags were slacking off, gambling, and getting drunk in taverns, he had been honing his combat skills regardless of wind, frost, rain, or snow, never once stopping for years—this was also why he didn't choose to immediately shout for help.



He wanted to personally avenge Grayhound.
