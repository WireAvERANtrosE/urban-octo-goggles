## Funeral
A funeral was being held on a wasteland in the southwest of Border Town.



Calling it a wasteland seemed inappropriate, as at some unknown time, this neglected piece of land had been enclosed by a low wall built of rough stones, topped with thick snow. From a distance, it looked as if it had been edged with silver. Although one could step over it easily, Tanner couldn't help but be reminded of the city walls at the border—they were the same color, the same shape.



He had only heard of such ceremonies from traveling merchants. When a member of a great noble family or the royal family passed away, the family of the deceased would gather in the cemetery, play sorrowful music, accept the condolences of others, and finally bury the coffin in the ground. The more noble the status, the more grandiose the ceremony.



Even the dead had a more splendid life than the living, he thought enviously at the time. What about the people who died in Border Town? They would just dig a hole on the edge of the Misty Forest and fill it in. He wondered if the demonic beasts ever dug up the corpses to eat during the Evil Months.



Death was not unfamiliar to the residents of Border Town. Especially every year, when winter approached and everyone sought refuge at Longsong Stronghold, huddling together in the slums of the shantytown, dying of hunger and cold, of disease and pain—it was all too common. No one had the time to grieve; it was better to wait for daylight and beg for an extra piece of bread in the town center.



But today, His Highness was actually holding a funeral for a soldier!



It was said that he was unfortunate enough to be knocked down and bitten in the head while chasing a mixed-breed demonic beast.



Tanner knew this unlucky fellow; he was an old face from the old district, with no name, everyone simply called him A'ji. He had a wife and two children, the older one seemed to be about six years old, and the younger had just started to walk.



Under normal circumstances, this family would definitely be finished. The woman could find another man to live with, but who would want to take on the burden of two children? Either abandon the little ones by the roadside to fend for themselves, or keep them and resort to soliciting in the taverns, only to eventually die of all sorts of strange diseases.



But His Royal Highness the prince seemed truly intent on fulfilling his promise made during the recruitment of the militia. Not only would the families of the deceased receive the full salary, but they were also entitled to an additional compensation—what was it called again? Tanner thought for a moment, ah... that's right, a pension. And this amount was as much as five gold royals.



In addition to that, a fixed amount of food and charcoal would be distributed every month, meaning that Agatha's wife could sustain her two children even without going out to work. Well, these nice-sounding words could just be for consolation, but the gold royals were very real. He had personally witnessed His Royal Highness hand over the pension to Sir Knight, who then passed it to Agatha's wife.



Damn it, why did he suddenly feel a bit envious of Agatha? No, no, Tanner shook his head repeatedly, dispelling these foolish thoughts. He certainly didn't want to die and leave his wife well-off... and she might very well become someone else's wife.



After the money was distributed, His Highness gave a speech. It was brief, but Tanner listened attentively. Especially the sentence "We will forever remember the sacrifice made to protect our loved ones and the innocent," it made him feel a surge of warmth in his heart. So that was it, he thought, no wonder recently, aside from bread and silver royals, he felt he had more to strive for—at least this winter, they could survive, relying on their own hands, not the charity from Longsong Stronghold.



The last part was the burial. Agatha's coffin was placed into the prepared grave, and Sir Knight had everyone line up, each militia member, whether official or reserve, took turns to shovel a bit of earth onto the grave. As for lining up, everyone was more than familiar, and over two hundred people quickly formed four columns. When it was Tanner's turn, he suddenly felt the shovel become slightly heavy, and the gazes of the surrounding members made each of his movements slow down.



When he stepped aside, his gaze passed that feeling onto the next person covering the grave.



Agatha's gravestone was a pure white rectangular stone, and Tanner could not recognize a single word on it. Moreover, he was not the first person to settle in this wasteland. Next to Agatha's grave was an identical gravestone, its top covered with snow. As everyone gradually left, Tanner saw the new captain of the Second Militia, Brian, slowly pour a jug of barley wine onto that gravestone.



If this was to be his final resting place, it didn't seem too bad, he couldn't help thinking.



"Your Highness," on the way back to the castle, Carter suddenly spoke up, "What you are doing..."



"Inappropriate?"

"No," he thought for a moment and finally shook his head, "I can't quite put my finger on it, but I feel that no one has ever treated the conscripted civilians like this before—they neither have noble titles nor family backgrounds, they don't even have surnames or given names."

"But you still feel good about it, right?"

"Uh..."

Roland smiled. Of course, he knew how strongly this would resonate with Carter, who was also committed to battle and protection. When people start to consider who and what they are fighting for, the team can undergo unimaginable changes. For Carter, the significance is that when honor is no longer the exclusive privilege of the nobility, the commoners who have nothing can also gain honor by defending their homes through his training and guidance, and this doubled sense of achievement is simply indescribable.

Of course, the public funeral was just the beginning, Roland thought. He had many more methods to enhance the collective sense of honor, such as establishing military flags, anthems, and setting up role models of heroes.

No spirit arises from nothing; it is only with the daily persistence of these practices and the constant instilling of their principles that they gradually become effective. To ensure the reliability of the aftermath system, he even arranged a follow-up team consisting of himself, the City Hall, and the Militia to ensure the subsequent distribution of food and charcoal.

The further he went, the heavier Roland felt on his shoulders. Border Town was lacking in so many ways; it seemed that both mining and civilian life were on the right track, with plenty of food reserves, and so far, there had been no cases of death from starvation or freezing. This was a miracle in the eyes of other towns, even in the capital of Greycastle, where many refugees or orphans were eliminated by winter every year.

But what he wanted was far more than that. The operation burden of the City Hall had reached its limit. With the help of Minister Assistant Barov and his dozen or so apprentices, they had propped up the entirety of Border Town's financial and administrative management. To expand the departments further, it was necessary to recruit some management personnel. He had also asked Barov if there were any outstanding students or colleagues still in the capital, but the response he got was a bucket of cold water: "Even if they are there, they would not be willing to come. Your Highness, do you really understand how bad your reputation is in the capital?"



Alright, that does sound quite reasonable, he thought dejectedly.



After returning to the castle's backyard, Nightingale emerged from the Mist and gave Wendy, who was waiting outside the wooden shed, an enthusiastic hug. Lightning was circling around the unfinished steam drilling machine, and upon seeing Roland, she immediately clamored to help assemble this rumored self-operating machine.



Watching all this, he suddenly felt that all the effort he had put in was worthwhile.
