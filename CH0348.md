## Mortals and the Extraordinary
Agatha awoke again to find the room empty, the thick curtains drawn tightly, casting a still silence throughout the space.

Likely considering that she was unfamiliar with the surroundings, a candle was kept burning by the bedside, its orange flame burning quietly without a drop of wax trickling down. It remained the same length, as if it would never burn out.

It must be the work of magic, she thought.

The blanket on her was very soft, probably woven from fine cotton, filled with light and warm down. Such treatment was not at all inferior to her time in the Holy City of Taquila, and it was hard to believe that such a comfortable bed and bedroom could exist in the barbaric lands.

She moved her fingers slightly, feeling much of her strength had returned. Agatha got out of bed, channeled her magic, and immediately a chill exuded from between her fingers—it seemed that the prince had not tampered further, instead, he had removed the Divine Stone of Judgement and granted her a degree of freedom.

She walked to the window and lifted a corner of the curtain. It was pitch black outside, with no stars or moon in sight, as if darkness had swallowed the entire land, leaving only a few faint lights flickering in the distance. Through the window, she could hear the howling wind outside, and occasionally see a few snowflakes falling on the glass.

It seemed to be winter now, a good season for a witch to awaken. In Taquila, one could never see such a night; every day of winter was a day of celebration for the entire city. Bonfires that never went out were lit in the streets, and when viewed from the tower, it seemed as if the entire city was ablaze. The twinkling lights were like stars, symbolizing hope and the future. People gathered around the bonfires to pray, hoping to gather magic and transcend the realm of mortals. Whenever a witch appeared, her family's fate changed, and they would be free from worry about food and clothing.

Agatha unlatched the bolt and pushed open the window. The cold wind instantly melded into the room, causing the curtains to billow backward. The candle inside was snuffed out as well. Darkness surged in, filling every corner of the room tightly. Once her eyes adjusted to the dark, she could see the faint white light reflected off the snow on the rooftops of the town. Judging by the scope of the buildings, the place was indeed not large, matching the "Border Town" the prince had mentioned.



In such cold weather, ordinary people would freeze after spending a few hours outside, but Agatha was not afraid of the cold. Any slight discomfort from the chill would be automatically ignored by her body. She used to feel cold before her awakening, but now, she had almost forgotten what it felt like.



Closing her eyes, Agatha's mind was filled with the conversation she had earlier.



The Union was gone, witches had become the minions of devils, and the common people, relying on the Divine Stone of Judgement, were hunting witches indiscriminately... From those notes, it was clear that Akaris and Natalia had both successfully escaped the Fertile Plains. If even they couldn't stop all of this, then the fall of the Union was a foregone conclusion.



What on earth had happened that these two extraordinary beings were defeated by mere mortals?



She didn't want to think about it anymore.



"Aren't you cold?" someone suddenly asked from behind.



Startled, Agatha turned around to see a woman sitting on the edge of the bed, her face completely hidden in the shadow of the night, like a ghost appearing silently. The door was still shut tight, and she had not heard any footsteps before.



"If you could close the window, I wouldn't mind lighting the candle again," the woman said.



The other was undoubtedly a witch.



What is she doing here so late?



Agatha nodded without a change in expression, closed the window, and quietly let a thin layer of ice crawl over her skin. The person who had come did not make any dangerous moves but instead opened the top drawer of the bedside table, took out a fire sickle, and lit a candle—with the light of the flame, she saw the other person's appearance: beautiful golden curly hair, slender eyebrows, and very sharp eyes, not any of the witches she had seen before.



"Nice to meet you... no, this is the second time we've met," she said, lifting the corners of her mouth, "My name is Nightingale."



Does that mean... she was also hidden among the crowd before? "Is this your ability?" Agatha frowned, "Are you also a senior Awakener?"



Even if she was a respectable senior witch, it was very impolite to barge in without greeting.



"Ah, you're talking about evolution..." Nightingale shook her head, "I'm not as smart as Anna, who can finish 'What Nature Fundamentals' in a short time. When I see those formulas and theorems, my head is going to explode. Evolution is probably out of my reach in this lifetime."



Agatha was stunned by the half-understood words in the brief reply. She had not expected the "Primeval Witch" to say such things and, judging by her expression, she didn't seem to be mocking her. Could these be the... knowledge that the prince spoke of?



"That 'Nature... Fundamentals,' can I take a look at it?"



"Of course, as long as you are willing to join the Witch Union and serve Prince His Highness," she shrugged.



"Serve a mortal?" Agatha widened her eyes and after a long while, she spoke softly, "I thought I was strange enough, but it turns out you are even more insane than me."



"Strange? Insane?" Nightingale tilted her head, "Why do you say that?"



"In the Holy City of Taquila, most of the awakened ones only see ordinary people who can't gather magic power as lowly servants, inferiors, or rather... breeding tools." She spoke slowly, "But I don't think so. Although they are foolish, they are not beyond help. As long as you teach them to learn and think, these people can do most things just as well as witches. For this reason, many consider me odd for entrusting some affairs of the tower to mortals. But you've gone a step further, actually acknowledging a mortal as your lord and serving him."



"Prince Roland doesn't treat us as servants," Nightingale pouted, "I don't know what strange understanding you have of the word 'serve,' but the fact is, he has sheltered witches oppressed by the Church, given new strength to our sisters, and allowed everyone to live together with the local residents on the Western Region's land, fighting together against the Church and the demonic beasts. In the future, we will also unite to confront the devils."



"But this model has been proven to be a failure!" Agatha raised her voice a little, "More than four hundred years ago... for you, it might be eight or nine hundred years ago, it was a time when mortals and witches co-governed. At that time, humans almost spread across the entire Dawn Realm, yet when facing the devils' attack, they were utterly defeated, leaving only the Fertile Plains."



"Oh?" She raised an eyebrow, "Is that so?"



"You say this buried history has been over four hundred and fifty years," Agatha continued, "According to the Union's records, the third Battle of Divine Will is about to begin, and you know nothing about the devils! To the east of the Barbarian Land lies the Whirlwind Sea, where else can you retreat to? Only by re-establishing the Union, uniting the witches, and using that knowledge to increase the chances of higher-level awakenings, is there a possibility to seize the last opportunity to halt the devils' advance!"



"Why must you say it like this?"



"What?"



"It's been over four hundred years now, hasn't it? Four hundred years can change a lot of things, why are you still clinging to your old notions?" Nightingale sighed, "You heard what His Highness said before he left, that mortals can defeat demons. He is also working on uniting people, not just witches, but he wants to unite every common person on the continent. He told me that the people spread across the continent are the most powerful group."



"Ridiculous—" Agatha began to retort to this absurd idea, but suddenly stopped. The other party spoke with such certainty, as if she had already seen the outcome. Could four hundred years really change all of this? Could it be... that the gray-haired prince actually has such an incredible ability to give mortals the power comparable to witches?



"It seems you've realized it," Nightingale said with a faint smile, "There is still a long time to go, why not let down your guard and see for yourself with your own eyes?"



This time, Agatha was silent for a long time, "…I can tell, you don't like me."



The other party did not argue.



"Witches from the Exploration Society often look at me with the same eyes—ever since they found out I employed a group of mortals as experimental assistants in the tower," she said, "You clearly don't like me, so why are you saying these things to me?"



"As long as you rein in your arrogance and treat His Highness normally, I can't say I dislike you that much, and as for the latter…" she paused, "Because His Highness said, he doesn't want to see you left behind by the times."
