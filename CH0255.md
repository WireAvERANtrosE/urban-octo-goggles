## Welcoming Approach
The storm came quickly and left just as fast.



The group set off the day after the rain stopped, and the ship responsible for taking them to Greycastle was none other than the Beauty of the Sea.



Sylvie leaned against the ship's railing, took out a piece of beef jerky from a cloth bag, and waved it above her head.



"Ow—Ow—"



A huge seagull, accompanied by its cry, descended from the sky, the airflow stirred by its wings causing her to squint involuntarily. The piece of jerky was snatched away in one bite, and by the time she looked up, the seagull had already returned to the front of the sailboat, continuing to lead the way across the vast ocean.



This was something Maggie had asked her to do because she couldn't take out the jerky to eat by herself when transformed into a bird.



Although at this moment her appearance was no different from an ordinary seagull (aside from her size), Sylvie could see the magic power surging within and the true form of the seagull. If one looked closely, one could also observe the process of magic power converging from all directions and then disappearing into the invisible as specks of light.



"I heard that she can not only transform into different birds but also gain their respective abilities?" someone marveled behind her. "As far as I know, seagulls will never lose their way at sea and can even sense the approach of a storm in advance."



"Indeed, Captain," Sylvie replied without turning around, knowing exactly who the speaker was. "Otherwise, we wouldn't dare to rashly choose a new route, bypassing the Endless Cape and landing in the southwest of Greycastle."



Her ability not only allowed her to observe the flow and changes of magic power but also granted her a broad field of vision without blind spots. At any time, she could observe the movements around her—even obstacles could not hinder the extension of her sight. She could even see sailors slacking off and sleeping below the deck, as well as schools of fish swimming past the bottom of the ship.



"Is there also a port over there?" Captain Jack exhaled a puff of smoke. "I remember that an explorer once went to the west side of the Endless Cape, but apart from cliffs and shallows, there was nothing there."



"It's better if there's nothing," Sylvie said nonchalantly. "That way, everyone can just return the way they came."



"Wouldn't that be a wasted trip?" The captain shook his pipe. "I was quite looking forward to seeing something different on this voyage of the new route."



This trip was entrusted by Lady Tilly to go to another witch gathering place to establish relations and help each other. Aside from the five selected witches on board, there were also Ashes and Molly—who did not go ashore but were there to ensure the journey was foolproof. Molly's magical servants could help the ship withstand storms, while Ashes could ensure that any pirate who set their sights on this ship would not return.



She also bore another responsibility, which was to ascertain the true identity of Roland Wimbledon for Lady Tilly.



Before setting off, Tilly had explained the reasons in detail and entrusted her with the possible findings and ways to deal with them. In short, she was to try her best to reach an agreement with the leader of the Mutual Aid Society to exchange back Roland's true body. However, to be honest, Sylvie always felt that this mission was not so easy to complete. It was one thing if the Mutual Aid Society did not agree, but what if they did not want the news to leak out and imprisoned herself and the other four?



Looking through the ship's cabin wall, she watched Lotus, Evelyn, and others having fun with the magical servants, and she couldn't help but sigh.



She hoped that the witches of the Mutual Aid Society were as enthusiastic and friendly as Maggie had said.



...

After sailing at sea for nearly a week, Sylvie finally saw the gray coastline.

"We're almost there." Honey was clamoring at the ship's railing, with a neat row of sea swallows, ospreys, and seagulls beside her, all making a noisy clamor.

"Are we finally there..." Candle, looking haggard, leaned against the railing, "I feel like I can't hold on much longer."

"This is all just a temporary phenomenon, child. Once you're ashore, you'll quickly recover back to normal," One-Eyed Jack laughed with a spyglass in hand. "I've been sailing for so many years, and I've never seen anyone die on a ship because of the bumps."

"Where's Maggie?" Honey asked.

"She's already flown ahead to Border Town to contact the witches of the Witch Cooperation Association," Ashes replied, "I believe someone will be sent to pick you up soon."

"Ashes, aren't you coming with us?"

"Tilly needs my help more," Ashes smiled, "Don't worry, the witches of the Witch Cooperation Association will treat you as sisters... If you encounter any difficulties, just find Wendy, she will definitely help you solve them as soon as possible."



Wendy, Sylvie silently noted the name in her heart.

"Right, there's one more thing," Ashes patted her forehead, "you must remember to keep your distance from Lord Roland Wimbledon, and never be alone with him easily."

"Why, isn't he Lady Tilly's brother?" Evelyn asked, puzzled.

"He is indeed," Ashes said seriously, "but that doesn't stop him from liking to touch the bottoms of witches!"

Everyone drew a sharp breath.

The sailboat eventually moored about half a mile away from the shallows, as there were no detailed nautical charts, and nobody knew how deep the water was at the edge of the shallows. The way to shore was simple; without even needing to deploy a landing boat, Molly had her servants wrap up the five of them, and they floated over the sea surface together with her.

The shallows were clearly an extension of the mountain and had become a soft sandy beach under the constant erosion of the sea. Not far away were towering mountains, completely separating the inland of Greycastle from the coast. The mountain range stretched on endlessly, becoming taller as it went west, almost turning into a giant peak similar to the Impassable Mountain Range at the edge of the horizon.

After waiting for about an hour, Sylvie noticed a strange shadow approaching from their direction.

It was enormous, almost the size of the Beauty under the Moon, and its round outline clearly did not seem like a natural creation. Logically, such a massive object should be incredibly heavy, yet its trajectory was quite smooth, as if it were floating in the air. Through the mountains and forests, she couldn't see it very clearly, but the thing was indeed climbing steadily and was about to cross over the mountain range.



Before long, it emerged from behind the obstruction, revealing its true form.

"My God, what is that?" Lily exclaimed in surprise, staring at the sky and asking in disbelief.

"Ashes, have you seen this thing before?" Evelyn tugged at her arm.

"No..." Ashes also seemed a bit surprised, "This is my first time seeing this thing."

"It seems this is the way the Mutual Aid Society is welcoming us," Sylvie said with a sigh.

One could see an astonishingly large spherical object floating in the air, with a basket woven from vines hanging below. Maggie and another witch flew alongside the basket, one on each side. What drew the eye was the long yellow canvas that hung from the bottom of the basket, with several huge words written on it.

—"Border Town welcomes you."
