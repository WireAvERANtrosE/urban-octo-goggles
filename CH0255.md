## Welcoming Approach
The storm came quickly and left just as fast.

The party set off the day after the rain stopped, and the ship responsible for taking them to Greycastle was the Darling.

Sylvie leaned against the ship's railing, pulled out a piece of beef jerky from a cloth bag, and waved it above her head.

"Ow— Ow—"

A huge seagull, crying out, descended from the sky, the airflow from its wings causing her to squint involuntarily. The jerky was snatched from her hand, and by the time she looked up, the seagull had already returned to the front of the sailboat, continuing to lead the way across the vast sea.

This was something Maggie had asked her to do because she couldn't take out the jerky to eat by herself when she transformed into a bird.

Although at the moment her appearance was no different from an ordinary seagull (except for her size), Sylvie could see the magic power surging within her and her true form. If she looked closely, she could even observe the process of magic power gathering from all directions and then dispersing into invisible specks of light.

"I heard she can not only transform into different birds but also acquire their abilities?" someone behind her clicked their tongue in wonder, "As far as I know, seagulls absolutely do not get lost at sea, and they can even sense the coming of storms in advance."

"Indeed, Captain," Sylvie replied without turning around, clearly knowing who the speaker was, "otherwise, we wouldn't dare to rashly choose a new route, bypassing the Endless Cape, and make landfall to the southwest of Greycastle."



Her ability not only allowed her to observe the flow and changes of magical power, but it also granted her a vast field of vision without any blind spots. At any time, she could observe the movements around her—obstacles were no impediment to the extension of her sight, and she could even see the sailors slacking off and sleeping below deck, as well as the schools of fish swimming under the ship.



"Is there also a port there?" Captain Jack exhaled a puff of smoke, "I remember explorers have gone to the western edge of the Endless Cape, but there was nothing but cliffs and shoals."



"It's better if there isn't," Sylvie said nonchalantly, "then everyone can just return the way they came."



"Doesn't that mean the trip would be a waste?" The captain shook his pipe, "I was quite looking forward to seeing something different on this new voyage."



This trip was entrusted by Lady Tilly, heading to another gathering place of witches to establish connections and mutual aid. Aside from the five chosen witches on board, there were also Ashes and Molly—though they did not go ashore, they were there to ensure the voyage was foolproof. Molly's magical servants could help the ship withstand storms, while Ashes made sure any pirates that set their sights on the ship would not return.



She also had another responsibility, which was to ascertain the true identity of Roland Wimbledon for Lady Tilly.



Before departure, Tilly had explained the reasons in detail and entrusted her with the possible findings and ways to deal with them. In simple terms, it was to reach an agreement with the leaders of the Co-op as much as possible and exchange for Roland's true body. However, to be honest, Sylvie always felt that this mission would not be so easy to complete. It was one thing if the Co-op did not agree, but what if they did not want the news to leak out and imprisoned both her and the other four?



Looking through the cabin walls, watching Lotus, Evelyn, and others having a blast playing with the magical servants, she couldn't help but sigh.



She hoped the witches of the Co-op were as enthusiastic and friendly as Maggie had said.



After sailing on the sea for nearly a week, Sylvie finally saw the dim coastline.



"We're almost there," Honey shouted, leaning over the ship's side, with a neat row of seagulls, ospreys, and seagulls beside her, all making a racket together.



"Are we finally there..." Candle, looking haggard, leaned on the ship's side, "I feel like I can't hold on much longer."



"This is all just a temporary phenomenon, child. Once you're on land, you will quickly recover," One-Eyed Jack laughed, holding up his spyglass. "I've been sailing for so many years and have never seen anyone die on a ship because of the shaking."



"Where's Maggie?" Honey asked.



"She has already flown ahead to Border Town to contact the witches from the Witch Cooperation Association," Ashes replied, "I believe they will soon send someone to pick you up."



"Ashes, aren't you coming with us?"



"Tilly needs my help more," Ashes smiled, "Don't worry, the witches of the Witch Cooperation Association will treat you as sisters... If you encounter any difficulties, just find Wendy, she will definitely help you resolve them right away."



Wendy, huh? Sylvie silently noted the name in her heart.

"Right, there's another thing," Ashes patted her forehead, "you must remember to stay away from Lord Roland Wimbledon, and never be alone with him easily."

"Why, isn't he Lady Tilly's brother?" Evelyn asked, puzzled.

"He is indeed," Ashes said seriously, "but that doesn't stop him from liking to grope witches' butts!"

Everyone took in a breath of cold air.

The sailboat finally anchored about half a mile from the shallows, after all, there was no detailed sea chart here, and no one knew how deep the water was near the shallows. The way to land was simple, not even needing to launch a landing boat, as Molly had her servants wrap the five of them, herself included, and floated over from the sea's surface.

This shallow area was clearly an extension of the mountains, and under the constant erosion of the seawater, it had become a soft sandy beach. Not far away were towering mountains that completely separated Greycastle's inland from the coast. The mountain range stretched on endlessly, growing higher towards the west, and at the edge of vision, it almost turned into giant peaks similar to the Impassable Mountain Range.

After waiting for about an hour, Sylvie noticed a strange, large shadow approaching from this direction.

Its volume was massive, almost comparable to the Pretty Woman, and its roundish outline clearly didn't seem like a natural creation. Logically, such a huge object should be incredibly heavy, but its trajectory was quite smooth, as if floating in the air. She couldn't see it very clearly through the mountains and forests, but the thing was indeed climbing steadily and was soon going to cross over the mountains.



Before long, it revealed its true form from behind its cover.

"My God, what is that?" Lily asked in astonishment, staring at the sky in disbelief.

"Ashes, have you seen this thing before?" Evelyn tugged at her arm.

"No..." Ashes also seemed surprised, "This is my first time seeing this thing as well."

"It seems this is the way the Mutual Aid Society welcomes us," Sylvie remarked.

A gigantic spherical object floated in the air, with a basket woven from vines hanging below it. Maggie and another witch flew alongside the basket, one on each side. What caught the eye was a long yellow canvas hanging from the bottom of the basket, with a few huge words written on it.

—— "Border Town welcomes you."
