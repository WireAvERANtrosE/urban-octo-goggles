## Prelude to a New Life
After the basket landed, a witch who appeared to be in her thirties with red hair hanging down to her waist stepped out of the basket and came forward, "Hello, welcome to Border Town, I am Wendy." Then she looked towards Ashes, showing a delighted smile, "You came too."



Is she the witch Ashes mentioned before? Sylvie thoughtfully sized up the two, it seemed they had known each other for a long time.



"Welcome, I am Anna." The appearance of another witch caught Sylvie's eye, those lake-like pure blue eyes were truly striking. But what concerned her more was the other's magic power—immense, robust, nearly flawless. A cube made up of black, white, and gray colors slowly rotated, even warping the trajectory of the magic power that gathered around it.



What an astonishing power? This was the first time Sylvie had seen such an oppressive magic force.



"Hi, I'm Lightning!" The little girl who had been flying beside the basket was indeed this one, and Maggie followed closely behind, landing on her shoulder.



"Co-coo!"



After Ashes gave a brief introduction of the witches from Sleeping Island, Wendy smiled and invited everyone to board the basket.



"This huge envelope above us is called a hot air balloon; as long as it's provided with scorching air, it can carry us all over the mountains and directly to our destination," she paused for a moment, then turned to Ashes and asked, "Aren't you really going to take a look at the town? I think His Highness would certainly like to see you again."



"He wouldn't welcome someone who plans to take away his witches," Ashes smiled, "Please take care of these kids."



"Is that so..." Wendy seemed a bit regretful as she pursed her lips, "Don't worry, I will take good care of them."

"Then everyone, hold tight," Anna reminded, "The Seagull is about to ascend."

Sylvie only felt a slight tremor under her feet, and the basket had left the ground. She stuck her head out and saw Ashes and Molly waving at them. As the hot air balloon rose higher and higher, the figures on the ground shrank smaller and smaller, turning into nail-sized spots—anyway, a new life was about to begin soon.

Wendy's ability seemed to be controlling the wind, and under her manipulation, the hot air balloon moved in the direction of the inland of Greycastle.

It was Sylvie's first time looking down at the land from the air. Although the earth and rocks could not stop her probing, it was still a novel experience to take in such a large range of sight at once. She tried to summon her Magic Eye, but the chaotic scenery flooded into her mind like a tide—the steep cliffs hidden deep in the sea, the underground rivers connected to the ocean, the animal skeletons buried in the soil, and the changes in the underground rock formations... These images instantly made Sylvie's head ache terribly, and the magic power in her body rapidly depleted. She quickly interrupted the Magic Eye and leaned against the edge of the basket, gasping for air.

"Are you okay?" someone asked. She opened her eyes and saw that it was Wendy.

"Uh, just a bit... dizzy."

"Take a few deep breaths, it will get better," Wendy said with a smile, "Many people feel uncomfortable the first time they are far from the ground."

"Thank you, I feel better now," Sylvie nodded.



The atmosphere along the way was much more harmonious than she had initially anticipated, just as Ashes had said. Wendy was caring towards everyone and did not treat them differently because they were newcomers. Anna was not very talkative, but she still answered earnestly whenever someone asked her a question. Lightning seemed to get along very well with Maggie and was also very lively, occasionally bringing the plump pigeon into the gondola to chat with everyone, never considering herself a stranger.



With Maggie acting as a bond between them, the other four gradually relaxed and began to inquire about the situation in Border Town from Lightning. Eventually, the little girl simply hovered at the edge of the gondola, telling everyone stories about the town's battles against demonic beasts and invaders, as well as His Highness's incredible inventions, leaving everyone in awe.



Before long, the hot air balloon arrived above the castle.



Just by its size, this town indeed lived up to the term "borderland," being both narrow and remote, its scale not even a third of Sleeping Island's. However, there were many townspeople, whether in the central square, around the outer walls, or by the river bank, one could see groups of people everywhere. They bustled about, converging into flowing streams of movement.



The hot air balloon landed directly in the castle courtyard. As soon as she stepped out of the gondola, a series of booming sounds suddenly erupted, catching Sylvie off guard and startling her, leaving her frozen in place for a moment. The other four were not much better off, with Honey even climbing back into the basket, poking out half of her head and asking, "What's happening?"



Wendy couldn't help but laugh, "Don't worry, these are the salutes His Highness is firing to welcome your arrival."



Passing through a corridor filled with greenery and entering the castle hall, Sylvie finally met Tilly's brother—he sat at the main seat in the hall, bearing a slight resemblance to the Fifth Princess, with the same gray hair and no unnecessary ornaments on his person, his expression relaxed and natural. Although his features were far from as pleasing as Lady Tilly's, he possessed a dignified aura, and just by sitting there, he could capture everyone's attention.



"Welcome to Border Town, I am the Lord of the Western Territory, Roland Wimbledon. I presume you already know my name," he said, standing up with a smile. "Tilly Wimbledon is my sister, so there's no need for you to feel restrained. You may consider this town as if it were Sleeping Island."



Sylvie couldn't help but activate her Magic Eyes, and then she was taken aback.



The expected darkness did not come; the other party was not wearing the Divine Stone of Judgement, and there were no traces of magical power activity on him—what he looked like originally was what he still looked like under true sight. He wasn't disguised, nor was he being controlled, which could only mean that the man before her was Roland himself.

And in the countermeasures given to her by Lady Tilly, for the situation where "no clues were found," there was only one sentence: send the message back to Sleeping Island.

...

She didn't take in a word of what Roland said next, her mind in complete disarray. To fulfill Lady Tilly's entrustment, she had thought through the wording and expressions for negotiation, and had even prepared to be imprisoned, only to find that none of that was necessary. All she had to do was wait until the end of the month and let Maggie take the intelligence back to complete the task.

But how could this be possible? A true nobleman, actually determined to protect witches? And to become the leader of the Witch Union?

The psychological gap left Sylvie feeling dazed, until His Highness arranged the sleeping quarters for the night, and she finally came back to her senses.

"The situation is roughly like this: the Witch Building is not yet completed, so you will have to temporarily stay in the castle and share a room with the other witches. Of course, this will also help you quickly integrate into the life of the town," Roland said. "There will also be a grand dinner tonight, as a formal welcome for everyone's arrival at Border Town, so enjoy it."

The room assignment was a relief for Sylvie; she was arranged to stay with Wendy, who seemed like a decent senior from their brief interaction and should be easy to get along with. But besides her, there appeared to be another witch living in the room named Nightingale.

Sylvie couldn't help hoping that she would be easy to get along with too.
