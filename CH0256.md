## Prologue to a New Life
After the basket touched the ground, a witch who looked to be about thirty years old, with red hair that fell to her waist, stepped out of the basket and came forward to greet them. "Hello, welcome to Border Town, I am Wendy." Then she turned her gaze to Ashes, revealing a delighted smile, "You're here too."



Was she the witch Ashes had mentioned before? Sylvie pondered as she sized up the two, it seemed that they had known each other for quite some time.



"Welcome, I am Anna." Another witch caught Sylvie's attention, her pair of lake-blue eyes were truly striking. But what intrigued her more was the other's magical power—vast, robust, almost flawless. A cube composed of black, white, and gray colors slowly rotated, even distorting the trajectory of the magic power that gathered around it.



What astonishing power was this? Sylvie had never seen such an oppressive magical force before.



"Hi, I'm Lightning!" The young girl had been flying next to the basket, and Maggie followed closely behind, landing on her shoulder.



"Co-coo!"



After Ashes briefly introduced the witches from Sleeping Island, Wendy smiled and invited everyone to board the basket.



"The huge envelope above us is called a hot air balloon, and as long as it can be provided with scorching hot air, it can carry us all over the mountains and directly to our destination," she paused for a moment and turned to ask Ashes, "Are you sure you don't want to take a look at the town? I'm sure His Highness would also love to see you again."



"He won't welcome someone who plans to take away his witches," Ashes laughed, "Please take care of these children."



"Is that so..." Wendy looked somewhat regretfully as she pursed her lips, "Don't worry, I will take good care of them."



"Then everyone hold tight," Anna reminded, "the Seagull is about to ascend."



Sylvie only felt a slight tremor beneath her feet, the basket had already left the ground. She poked her head out and saw Ashes and Molly waving at them. As the hot air balloon rose higher and higher, the scenery on the ground shrank smaller and smaller, and the two of them quickly became nail-sized spots—the new life was about to start regardless.



Wendy's ability seemed to be wind control, and under her manipulation, the hot air balloon moved in the direction of the inland of Greycastle.



This was Sylvie's first time overlooking the land from the sky. Although the earth and rocks could not stop her from probing, taking in such a wide range of view all at once was still a novel experience. She tried to summon the Magic Eye, but the chaotic scenery flooded into her mind like a tide—the steep cliffs hidden deep in the sea, the underground rivers connected to the ocean, the animal skeletons buried in the soil, and the changes in the underground rock layers... These images immediately caused Sylvie a splitting headache, and her magical power plummeted. She quickly interrupted the Magic Eye and leaned over the edge of the basket, gasping for air.



"Are you okay?" someone asked. She opened her eyes and saw that it was Wendy.



"Um, just a bit... dizzy."



"Take a few deep breaths, it will get better," Wendy said with a smile, "Many people feel uneasy when they are far from the ground for the first time."



"Thank you, I feel better now," Sylvie nodded.



The atmosphere along the way was much more harmonious than she had initially anticipated, just like Ashes had said, Wendy was caring towards everyone and did not treat them differently because they were newcomers. Anna might not have been talkative, but she would still respond seriously whenever someone asked her a question. Lightning seemed to get along very well with Maggie, and her lively personality shone through as she occasionally flew into the basket with the fat pigeon to chat with everyone, not seeing herself as a stranger at all.



With Maggie acting as a bridge between them, the other four also gradually relaxed and started to ask Lightning about the situation in Border Town. Eventually, the young girl simply hovered at the edge of the basket, telling everyone stories about the town's battles against the demonic beasts and invaders, as well as the prince's incredible inventions, leaving everyone in awe.



Before long, the hot air balloon arrived above the castle.



Just by size, this town truly lived up to the term "borderland," being both narrow and remote, its scale not even a third of that of Sleeping Island. However, there were many townspeople. Whether in the central square, around the perimeter of the city walls, or along the riverbanks, groups of people could be seen everywhere. They bustled to and fro, converging into flowing streams.



The hot air balloon landed directly in the castle courtyard. As soon as she stepped out of the basket, a series of booming sounds suddenly erupted, catching Sylvie off guard and startling her so much that she froze on the spot. The other four were not much better off, with Honey even climbing back into the basket and poking out half her head to ask, "What's happening?"



Wendy couldn't help but laugh, "Don't worry, this is His Highness playing the salute cannons to welcome your arrival."



Passing through the shaded corridor and entering the castle hall, Sylvie finally met Tilly's brother—he was seated at the main seat of the hall. He looked somewhat similar to Princess Tilly, with the same gray hair and an appearance devoid of any unnecessary decorations. His expression was relaxed and natural. Although his face was far less pleasing to the eye than Lady Tilly's, he exuded a stable aura that naturally attracted everyone's attention just by sitting there.



"Welcome to Border Town, I am the lord of the Western Territory, Roland Wimbledon. I presume you've already heard my name," he said with a smile as he stood up. "Tilly Wimbledon is my sister, so you need not feel constrained. Treat this town as you would Sleeping Island."



Sylvie couldn't help but activate her Magic Eyes, and then she couldn't help but be taken aback.



The anticipated darkness did not appear; the other party did not wear the God's Punishment Stone, nor was there any trace of magical power activity on his body—he was the same as he originally appeared under True Sight. He was neither disguised nor controlled, which could only mean that the man before her was indeed Roland himself.



And in the countermeasures given to her by Lady Tilly, for the scenario "no clues found," there was only one instruction: send the message back to Sleeping Island.

...

She did not listen to what Roland said next, her mind a chaotic mess. She had prepared everything for the negotiation, from her choice of words to her expressions, and even prepared for the possibility of being imprisoned, but none of it turned out to be necessary. Now, all she had to do was wait until the end of the month for Maggie to take this information back, and her mission would be complete.



But how could this be possible? A true nobleman, determined to protect witches? And to become the leader of the Witch Union?



The psychological gap made Sylvie feel somewhat dizzy, and it was not until His Highness arranged their sleeping quarters for the night that she came back to her senses.



"The situation is like this: the Witch Building is not yet completed, so you will have to temporarily stay in the castle, sharing a room with other witches. Of course, this also makes it easier for you to integrate into the life of the town," Roland said. "Tonight, there will also be a grand banquet waiting for everyone, as a formal welcome to Border Town. Enjoy it."



The result of the room assignment was a relief to Sylvie. She was arranged to stay with Wendy, who, from this brief interaction, indeed seemed like a nice senior and would probably be easy to get along with. But aside from her, there seemed to be another witch living in the room named Nightingale.



Sylvie couldn't help but hope that she would also be an easy person to get along with.
