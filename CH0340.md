## The Reason for the Choice
The monster that burst out of the crowd was shot dead, and the sudden change caused a panic among the refugees. Dozens of warriors wearing strange weapons gathered around, and the scene was filled with screams, gradually becoming uncontrollable. At this moment, the prince's loud voice suddenly resounded above the crowd—



"Be quiet, my people. I am your lord, Roland Wimbledon. Now listen to me."



Although the voice was loud, it was not a hysterical shout, but a clear and steady statement. Vader felt as if the other party was speaking right next to his ear, his words carrying an undeniable power that overwhelmed the noise and panic of the scene.



The crowd suddenly fell silent.



"Just as you have heard on your way here, Border Town will provide you with shelter from the wind and snow, food that will fill your bellies, and many jobs with generous wages. I am here to tell you, all of this is true."



"The houses are solid mud-brick homes, with not a single drafty crack, and there are charcoal stoves under the beds. Sleeping on them is as comfortable as lying on grass warmed by the summer sun. As long as the doors and windows are closed, even if you only wear a single layer of clothing, you will not feel cold at all."



"The food is wheat porridge with dried meat. When scooped with a spoon, you can see wheat grains dripping, and as you pour it into your mouth, it will fall slowly due to its thickness. Just one bowl will fill your stomach."



Hearing this, Vader suddenly felt hungry. The content spoken by His Highness the Prince was very novel. He did not, like most nobles, repeatedly emphasize his own power and the obligations of his subjects, declaring that everyone under his rule must follow his will. Instead, he described his promises from the perspective that the public cared about most, using food and clothing, and looking at the longing expressions on the faces of the refugees by the dock, it was clear that his words undoubtedly touched their hearts more.



"I hope all my subjects can live a good life without worrying about food and clothing, but the enemies lurking in the dark do not want to see this happen. These beasts that have rushed out are undoubtedly sent by them, for a simple reason—they do not want to see me alive, nor do they want my subjects to live comfortably."



"If I were no more, would there be other lords to offer warm housing and delicious food? You should all be very clear about this, just look at the hardships you've faced before. I am the only one willing to do so."

Vedas found that the panic had dissipated. When those monsters, who didn't act like normal people, were regarded as a common enemy, the refugees' unease and worry gradually turned into anger—the assassin who tried to harm His Highness was also the villain who wanted to destroy their peaceful lives, and such a person was unforgivable.



"To prevent such attacks from happening again, we need to redo the inspections. This time, my personal guards will be responsible for the body searches, ensuring that no enemy has the chance to ruin everything!"

Everyone complied with His Highness's decree. Even those who had already crossed the checkpoint were taken back to the dock area by the guards, and no one protested. The order was even more orderly than before.

Truly worthy of His Royal Highness, Vedas couldn't help but sigh with admiration; with just a few words, he had dispelled the imminent chaos.



"Did I hear that you were the first to notice something was wrong?" Carter Lannis approached and said, "Come with me, His Highness wishes to see you."

Following behind the Chief Knight, he came before the young prince and knelt on one knee, "Greetings to you."

"Tell me, how did you realize something was off with him?" the prince asked.

Vedas reported his findings honestly.



"Sharp observation skills, were you just an ordinary civilian before?"

"No, Your Highness. I served in the patrol team of Golden Wheat City," he answered honestly, "for almost six years, until Golden Wheat City was attacked by a large group of pirates."

"But your resume does not list any special skills," the prince said. "I inquired with Carter, and he said you are still staying in the temporary residential area, in other words, when the City Hall registered the early settlers, you concealed your experience — and there was no need for that. Why?"

Although he didn't understand what 'resume' meant, it didn't stop him from answering the question. Wetter hesitated for a moment and then told the prince about Kakkak Symon, "Without this prisoner, I wouldn't have been able to survive and come to Border Town, so I couldn't just leave him alone in the western district."

"So you want to become a patrol member, so that you can take extra care of him during patrol duties in the future?"

"I..." Wetter's heart suddenly tightened. From the previous judgment, it was clear that His Highness cared a lot about whether the system was being followed, and his own approach was obviously overstepping the boundaries.

"Don't worry, you haven't done it yet, and you won't be punished just for thinking about it," the other party said with a smile, as if seeing through his thoughts.

However, this also made Wetter feel a little disappointed. Without a doubt, His Highness did not approve of this approach, and even if he successfully became a police officer, if he were biased in handling disputes, he would only follow in the footsteps of that City Hall clerk.

"Do you have a family?" the prince suddenly asked.



"...They all perished in that plunder of Golden City."

"Kakakshim?"

"He shouldn't have," despite not understanding why His Highness would ask this, Vader still truthfully replied, "If he had, the rat wouldn't have chosen him as the scapegoat."

"Anyone with any special skills can get priority to rent a set of housing in the district and receive an identity document issued by the Town Hall, enjoying all the rights that a citizen has. Naturally, this includes their family members," the prince smiled, "You should understand what I mean, right?"

Vader was startled and couldn't help but exclaim in surprise, "You agree to let me bring Kakakshim..."

"Take the elder to the Town Hall for registration; they will help you arrange it."

He held back his excitement and knelt again, saying, "Your Highness is merciful!"

"Do not relax; maintain the vigilance you have today," the prince nodded, "If you cannot pass the subsequent assessments, even as a family member, you will only be able to stay temporarily in the provisional area."

"Yes!"



With the matter that had been weighing on his mind finally settled, Ved felt much lighter. Just as he was about to take his leave, he suddenly remembered the paper test. After hesitating for a moment, he couldn't help but ask, "Your Highness, during the first round of testing, there were many questions I did not know the answers to and simply wrote down whatever came to mind. Why did you still choose me?"



"Because there were no correct answers to begin with," the prince quirked his lips, "Every answer varies from person to person. The key to the test wasn't about the answers, but to assess the literacy and writing abilities of the candidates. As long as you could understand the questions and write down your thoughts, you would have passed the test."
