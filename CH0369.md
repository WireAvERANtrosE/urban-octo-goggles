## Transformation
Steam rose in waves from the pool in the bathroom.

Wendy spread the wet soap all over the little girl's body, not sparing behind her ears, her armpits, or between her fingers. Seeing patches of dirt slide off with the foam to reveal the tender skin underneath gave her an unprecedented sense of satisfaction.

It had been a long time since she had experienced this feeling. During the escape with the Witch Cooperation Association, every new witch who was panic-stricken or fell into despair regained their calm under her care and rekindled their hope for a better life. Leaf was like this, Lili was like this, and so was Nightingale... However, since arriving in Border Town, the lives of the witches had undergone earth-shaking changes, and everyone no longer needed to worry about survival—she wasn't saying this was bad, and she was very grateful for everything Roland had done for the sisters, but with no witches needing care, even Miya had become cheerful, which made Wendy feel a bit lost.

Now, she finally relived the joy of being an elder sister.

"Close your eyes, I'm going to rinse you now."

"Mhm." The other's voice was light and soft, like water droplets sliding off grass leaves.

She had to say, His Highness's decision was truly wonderful.

The water flowed through the girl's hair, down her back, washing away the foam that had turned gray-brown. Only after rinsing three times did the water finally return to its normal color.

Without the cover of clothes, her frail body was fully exposed to Wendy's eyes. Such a frail child, Wendy couldn't help but think, her spine protruding segment by segment on her back, her arms so thin they could be encircled with just one hand, and her skin not white but showing the pale yellow of prolonged hunger, which did not match her name "White Paper" at all.



Fortunately, she was a witch and, with proper care, she would be able to recover before long.



After cleansing her body, it was time for the delightful bath. Wendy tested the water temperature and lifted her into the bathtub. The slightly scalding hot water immediately engulfed them both, but after enduring the initial discomfort, they quickly felt the bliss of being wrapped in warmth.



Paper could not help but let out a low moan, probably because it had been a long time since she had last enjoyed a hot bath. The hands that tightly clutched Wendy gradually relaxed. Wendy turned the girl half around to sit in her embrace, carefully separating her tangled hair.



"When did you realize you were a witch?" she asked.



"Two... years ago," Paper replied softly, "I think it was also in winter."



"That's not unusual," Wendy said with a smile. "Most witches awaken during the Evil Months because it's rumored that magic is most abundant during that time."



"Isn't it the devil's power?"



"Of course not," she patted the other's head. "Becoming a witch is a very, very normal thing. Aside from being able to wield incredible powers, we aren't much different from ordinary people. You should know that hundreds of years ago, witches were even considered the favored children of the gods."



"Really?"



"Absolutely certain." Actually, there is quite a big difference between the two, such as in appearance, the overall enhancement of one’s body, and the inability to bear offspring, Wendy thought, but these can be taught to her slowly in the future.

"Then... what is magic power?" Scroll asked timidly.

"It's a naturally formed force, omnipresent like the radiance of the sun," Wendy thought for a moment, "That's not quite right either, the sun sets while magic power does not. In any case, you should think of it as a part of your body, and moreover, a part that keeps growing."

"It keeps growing?"

"That's right, it will become stronger as you grow older, and to accommodate it, you must also improve your body's ability to endure it; otherwise, you will suffer from backlash." She explained carefully, "The Church takes advantage of this, claiming that witches are devoured by demonic powers, which is completely wrong. As long as you continuously practice your abilities, you can increase the capacity for magic power, and there's no need to worry about it affecting your body. If you awakened as a witch two years ago, you should have already experienced your first Awakening Day, it must have been painful... back then."

The girl nodded lightly twice.

"Don't worry, now that you've come to Border Town, everything will get better," Wendy comforted her softly, "If you work hard at your practice, you should be able to get through this year's Awakening Day with ease."

While she was speaking, the bathroom door was suddenly pushed open, and Lily ran in holding a towel, "I heard we've got a new sister? Where is she? Miya said she really wants to see!"

"It's you who wants to see, not me!" Miya followed behind, rolling her eyes, "Go ahead and bathe now, what if we need to practice our abilities in the afternoon?"



"Rest assured, taking a day off won't be a problem. His Highness won't trouble you for it; you are not Miss Anna, after all."

"...You traitor!"

Paper shrank her head down upon seeing the two burst in, half submerging into the water.

"Oh, is this the new witch?" Lily propped herself on the edge of the bath, looking at her with interest. "Seems about my age, but you can still call me 'sister'."

"Why should I call you 'sister' just because we're about the same age," Miya protested, "I never saw you calling me that."

"They are all witches from Border Town," Wendy introduced with a smile, "Don't mind their current state. When they first arrived here, both of them acted pretty much like you... especially Miya, who wasn't much braver than you, and spoke in a very soft and gentle voice."

"Cough cough, I was just worried that His Highness would look down on my insufficient abilities," Miya muttered.

"His Highness has told me many times that your abilities have great potential," Wendy shook her head, "Once you finish 'Elementary Physics', it's possible that your powers could evolve beyond imagination."

"Don't bring up those books. She hasn't even fully recognized all the characters, and she barely passed the last test," Lily shrugged, "She even comes to me for tutoring at night. By the time she learns all those strange theorems and formulas in the book, Roland may have already unified Greycastle and no longer need the help of witches." Ignoring Miya, who had her brows furrowed, she turned to Wendy, holding the girl in her arms, "By the way, what is Paper's ability?"



"...to make the snow melt," the other party hesitated before speaking.

"What else?" Lily asked curiously. "Can you turn the melted water back into ice?"

"No," Paper said in a low voice. "And... and I can quickly cool down hot water."

"Is this temperature control?" Wendy pondered. "But melting snow is heating up, and cooling hot water is cooling down. They can't be reversed, so it doesn't quite fit. Have you only tried using your ability on water?"

"Other things don't change much."

"Try this." Lily held up a basin of washed soap water.

The girl carefully extended her hand into the basin, and quickly, the steamy water cooled down. Then, under everyone's gaze, the murky soapy water underwent a strange change; the floating bubbles gradually disappeared, the churning white particles also vanished, and the basin of water became clear and transparent again.
