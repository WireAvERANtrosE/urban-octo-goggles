## The Answer
Sleeping Island's environment is improving day by day. As long as she took to the skies, Tilly could see the crowds of people coming and going and the bustling markets. 



Now it was no longer the place where three hundred or so witches lived in isolation at the beginning. Through negotiation and consultation, Crescent Moon Bay, Double Dragon Island, Sunset Harbor, and Shallow Beach had all established commercial ties with Sleeping Island. Tilly had also brought in a group of ordinary residents from some overcrowded village islands. 



Although they currently lived on the outskirts of the island, far away from the witches, Tilly believed that one day Sleeping Island would become a city where everyone lived together without distinction. Integration was a slow but exciting process, whether it was other awakened witches from the islands joining Sleeping Island or staying in their birthplace, accepted by the local people—it was all good news for Sleeping Island. It meant that Tilly and the witches who had migrated would gain more supporters. 



"Come down, the wind is picking up," Ashes called out from below, "Be careful not to fall!"



"I'm fine!" she waved her hand, then suddenly her body sank down, dropping a distance before stabilizing her form, "Hmm... it's still a bit hard to control."



"If you know it's hard to control, don't fly so high!" Ashes stamped her foot, "You could practice at a lower place, or over the sea. If you don't come down, I'm going to have to climb up to the roof to catch you."



"Alright, alright, I know." Tilly felt the wind indeed getting stronger and didn't try to be stubborn any longer. She retracted the magic she had released and slowly descended into the garden of her residence.



"Next time you do something like this, call Molly up," Ashes said with widened eyes, "At least her magic servants can catch you."



"As long as I keep supplying magic power, it's impossible for me to fall. At worst, I just can't control the direction," she took off the blue magic stone gloves in her hand and handed them over, "You try it too, the feeling of flying is simply too great. Overlooking Sleeping Island from the sky, you'll feel like the whole world has become brand new."



"I'd rather not," Ashes waved her hand, "I couldn't even activate the initial lightning stone, let alone this kind that requires a continuous infusion of magic power. And there's only one of it, even if I mastered the control technique, there's no way I could fly with you."

"That's true," Tilly said with a hint of regret as she put away the gloves, "I often think, if we could figure out the principles behind it, how nice it would be to create magic stones with similar abilities ourselves."

"Do you think it's man-made?"

"Of course," she nodded without hesitation, "whether you look at the polish or the purpose, these stones are unlikely to be naturally formed. The people who built the ruins must have had a deeper understanding of magic power, it's just a pity that besides a pile of difficult-to-understand documents, they didn't leave more clues."

Just then, a huge white figure fell from the sky, and due to the rapid descent, it nearly thudded onto the ground, stirring up a circle of dust.

"Maggie?" Ashes raised an eyebrow.

"Ow... that hurts, coo," the newcomer was the little girl who got up from the ground, rubbing her head and said, "Did I just see things? Lady Tilly was actually flying in the sky! If not for the different hair color, I would have thought it was Lightning."

"You didn't see wrong, I did indeed fly just now," Tilly smiled and rubbed her cheek, "How about it... how are the witches from Sleeping Island doing in Border Town?"

"Pretty good, coo, they all asked me to send letters to you," Maggie rummaged through her bag for the letters, "This one's from Lily, this one's from Evelyn, and this one... is from His Highness the Prince."



Tilly blinked in surprise as she saw that the letter from His Highness the Prince was as thick as half a finger, wrapped tightly, looking more like a parcel. It felt somewhat heavy in her hands, obviously containing more than just a simple sheet of paper.



"Thank you for your hard work."



Ashes took out half a wheat cake, broke off a small piece, and handed it to Maggie, who shook her head and stuffed a handful of dried fish into her mouth, mumbling, "I'm going to play with Molly." After saying that, she turned back into a giant white pigeon and flew out of the yard with a flap of her wings.



"Why do I feel like she's gotten even bigger after not seeing her for a month?"



"I feel the same," Tilly laughed, "It seems life in Border Town really is good."



Back inside the house, she tore open the letter from Roland Wimbledon and found that in addition to a piece of paper filled with text, the rest of the dozen or so pages were all lifelike drawings.



"What is this?"



Ashes' question was also Tilly's doubt; she shook her head and spread out the sheets of drawing paper—the content was somewhat unbelievable: set against the backdrop of a desolate evening wilderness under a blood-red sunset, two horrifying monsters were battling a group of witches. The witches were clearly at a disadvantage, their abilities seemed to have lost their effect, neither serpents nor fireballs could stop the enemy's advance. By the last drawing, several witches had already fallen in pools of blood.



Tilly's brows furrowed deeply; the scene before her was undoubtedly the work of witches, only magic could create such vivid images. But… were these merely simple scrolls, or were they depictions of events that had actually occurred?



She uneasily grabbed the letter and began to scan through it quickly.

Soon, Tilly felt her chest tighten, a word that appeared repeatedly on the letter made her hands tremble slightly: "Devils."

"What's wrong?" Ashes grasped her wrist. "What does the letter say?"

"The past of the Witch Cooperation Association," she patted the back of her hand to signal that she was alright, "They once searched for the Holy Mountain in the Barbarian Land... You should still remember the tale of the Holy Mountain, right?"

"Yes, the legendary destination for witches, where true tranquility and peace can be found in the Holy Mountain. But it's nothing but a baseless rumor," Ashes said dismissively. "We can also live peacefully on Sleeping Island, and the demonic plague is nothing but a lie woven by the church."

"But Hala believed that the Holy Mountain truly existed and she had found an ancient book in the ruins of the Eastern Region Forest, thinking that the gateway to the Holy Mountain was in that uncharted forbidden land. So she led the Witch Cooperation Association over the Impassable Mountain Range, towards the Fertile Plains. However, the witches did not find the Holy Mountain, but they encountered a terrifying monster," Tilly said in a low voice.

"The kind on the painting?" Ashes inhaled sharply.

"Exactly," she said with a somewhat heavy expression, "The letter says that they possess astonishing strength, are agile, can command demonic beasts, and one of them could even release lightning from its hands... just like a witch's power. In the end, out of more than forty witches, only six survived. Afterwards, with no place to go, they decided to seek refuge with the lord of Border Town."

"So it turned out to be... like this."



"Furthermore, what puzzles me is that the last part of the ancient book contains a hastily written note drafted in the script of the Four Kingdoms," Tilly turned to the back of the letter, "It mentioned the Holy City, the battle against the devils, and the trials of the God's Punishment Army by Akaris, which should be events from over four hundred years ago. If they were aware of the language of the Kingdoms, why would they use a completely different script for documenting their literature and books?"



After pondering for a long time without reaching a conclusion, the Fifth Princess simply set all these matters aside and took out the letter from Hill. She intended to learn about the investigation into the lord of Border Town first.



The very first sentence of the letter left her dumbfounded, even more shocked than when she saw the word 'devil'.



"Lady Tilly, I have not found any signs of disguise or magical influence on Roland Wimbledon, and apart from the Witch Union, there are no other witches hiding their powers in the town. Therefore, I think... he might be your true brother."
