## Answer
The environment of Sleeping Island was improving by the day. Once she took to the skies, Tilly could see the bustling crowds and lively markets below.

It was no longer the isolated refuge for the initial three hundred witches; through negotiations, Crescent Moon Bay, Twin Dragon Island, Sunset Harbor, and Shallow Water Town had all established commercial ties with Sleeping Island. She had also brought in a group of ordinary residents from some of the overcrowded village islands.

Although they currently lived on the outskirts of the island, far away from the witches, Tilly believed that one day Sleeping Island would become a city where everyone lived together without division. Integration was a slow but hopeful process. Whether it was the awakening witches from the other islands joining Sleeping Island, or those who stayed in their birthplaces and were accepted by the local population, it was all good news for Sleeping Island. It meant that Tilly and the migrating witches would gain more supporters.

"Come down, it's getting windy," Ashes shouted from below, "Be careful not to fall!"

"I'm fine!" she waved her hand, then suddenly her body sank downward, dropping a distance before stabilizing her form, "Hmm... it's just still a bit hard to control."

"If you know it's hard to control, don't fly so high!" Ashes stomped her foot, "You could practice lower to the ground or over the sea. If you don't come down now, I'll have to climb up to the roof to catch you."

"Alright, alright, I get it." Tilly felt the wind indeed getting stronger and didn't push her luck, retracting the magic power she had released and slowly landed in the garden of her residence.

"Next time you do this, please call Molly," Ashes said with eyes wide, "At least her magic servants could catch you."

"As long as I keep supplying magic power, I won't fall. At worst, I'll just lose control of the direction," she removed the blue magic stone gloves from her hands and handed them to the other person, "You should try it too. The feeling of flying is simply amazing. Overlooking Sleeping Island from the sky makes you feel like the whole world is brand new."



"I still can't," Ashes waved her hand, "I couldn't even activate the initial lightning magic stone, not to mention this type that requires continuous magic input. Besides, there's only one, even if I mastered the control technique, I wouldn't be able to fly with you."

"That's true," Tilly said with a slight sense of regret as she retracted her glove, "I often think how great it would be if we could understand the principle behind it and create magic stones with corresponding abilities ourselves."

"Do you think it's man-made?"

"Of course," she nodded without hesitation, "Whether considering the polished appearance or the purpose, it's unlikely these stones are naturally formed. The people who built the ruins must have had a deeper understanding of magic power, it's just a pity that they didn't leave more clues besides a bunch of incomprehensible documents."

Just then, a huge white figure fell from the sky, hitting the ground with a thud due to the high speed of descent, kicking up a cloud of dust.

"Maggie?" Ashes raised an eyebrow.

"Ow... that hurts, coo," the newcomer was the little girl who got up from the ground, rubbing her head, "Did I just see things? Lady Tilly was actually flying in the sky! If not for the different hair color, I would have thought it was Lightning."

"You didn't see wrong, I did fly just now," Tilly smiled and rubbed her cheek, "How is it... are the witches from Sleeping Island doing well in Border Town?"

"They're doing quite well, coo, they all asked me to send letters to you," Maggie rummaged through her bag for the letters, "This one is from Lily, this is from Evelyn, and this... is from His Highness the Prince."



Tilly was slightly taken aback to see that the letter from His Highness the Prince was half a finger thick. It was wrapped tightly, more resembling a package. It felt somewhat heavy in her hand, clearly indicating that it contained more than just a simple piece of paper.



"Much appreciated."



Ashes took out half a piece of wheat cake, broke off a small piece, and handed it to Maggie. However, Maggie shook her head, stuffed a handful of dried fish into her mouth, and said indistinctly, "I'm going to play with Molly." With that, she transformed back into a giant white pigeon and flew out of the garden, flapping her wings.



"How come I feel that she's gotten even bigger after not seeing her for a month?"



"I feel the same," Tilly laughed. "It seems that life in Border Town is really quite nice."



Back inside the house, she tore open the letter from Roland Wimbledon and found that, in addition to a piece of paper filled with writing, the remaining dozen or so pages were actually lifelike drawings.



"What is this?"



Ashes's question echoed Tilly's own confusion. Shaking her head, she spread out the sheets of paperâ€”one by one, the content was hard to believe: The background appeared to be a wilderness at dusk, under a blood-red sunset, two monstrous creatures were fighting a group of witches. The witches were clearly at a disadvantage, their abilities seemingly ineffective; neither serpents nor fireballs could stop the enemy's advance. By the last page, several witches had already fallen into pools of blood.



Tilly's brow furrowed deeply. The scene before her was undoubtedly drawn by a witch; only magic could create such vivid images. But... Were these just simple drawings, or were they depictions of events that had actually occurred?



She nervously grabbed the letter and quickly skimmed through it.

Soon, Tilly felt her heart constrict; a word that kept appearing on the letter made her hands tremble slightly: "devil".

"What's wrong?" Ashes held her wrist, "What does the letter say?"

"The past of the Union," she patted the back of her hand, indicating she was fine, "They once searched for the Holy Mountain in the barbaric lands... You should still remember the tale of the Holy Mountain, right?"

"Yes, the supposed final resting place for witches where true tranquility and peace can be found within the Holy Mountain, but that's nothing more than ethereal rumors," Ashes said dismissively, "We can live peacefully on Sleeping Island just the same, and the demonic possession is nothing but a lie spun by the Church."

"But Hara believed the Holy Mountain truly existed, and she even found an ancient book in the ruins of the Eastern Region forest, which led her to believe that the gateway to the Holy Mountain was in that uncharted forbidden land. Thus, she led the Union over the Impassable Mountain Range, towards the wilderness, but instead of finding the Holy Mountain, the witches encountered a terrifying monster," Tilly said quietly.

"Like the one in the drawing?" Ashes gasped.

"Exactly," she said with a heavy expression, "The letter says that they possessed astonishing strength, were agile, could command demonic beasts, and one of them could even release lightning from their hands... just like a witch's ability. In the end, out of more than forty witches, only six survived. After being driven to despair, they decided to seek refuge with the lord of Border Town."

"So it was... like this."



"Furthermore, what baffles me is that at the end of that ancient book, there is a hastily written note composed in the script of the Four Kingdoms," Tilly flipped to the back of the letter, "It mentioned the Holy City, battling with devils, and the trials of the God's Punishment Army by Akaris. These should be events from over four hundred years ago, and if they were aware of the language of the kingdoms, why would they use an entirely different script to record their documents and books?"



After pondering for a long time without any conclusion, the fifth princess simply put all these matters aside and took out the letter from Hill Fawkes, intending to first understand the results of the investigation into the lord of Border Town.



The first sentence of the letter made her stare in astonishment, even more shocked than when she saw the word 'devil'.

"Lady Tilly, I have found no traces of disguise or magical influence on Roland Wimbledon, and besides the Witch Union, there are no other witches belonging to hidden forces in the town. Therefore, I think... he might truly be your brother."
