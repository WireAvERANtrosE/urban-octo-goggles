## Nighttime Talk
The witches had not gone to sleep at this time either. After a series of hardships, they still couldn't believe the fact that they were taken in by the prince. No shackles, no guards, just letting everyone live in the castle like this, and in such spacious and comfortable rooms?



Wendy probably guessed the sisters' unease, so she and Nightingale called everyone to her room, sitting in a circle around the bed, and used conversation to soothe everyone's emotions.



This is the demeanor of a leader, Leaf thought to herself. If it were Cara, she definitely wouldn't have been so attentive, or rather, even if she noticed, she wouldn't have the leisure to comfort her sisters.



"Sister Wendy, what... what will Prince His Highness ask us to do?" Hummingbird asked timidly, "Our abilities are far inferior compared to you and Sister Nightingale."



This remark resonated with the other sisters, and they all nodded in agreement.



Wendy chuckled, "Let me think... well, the first thing you need to do is to practice your abilities."



"Practice our abilities?" Soraya hesitated, "Does His Highness want me to keep drawing?"



"Very likely," Wendy patted Miya, who was sitting beside her with her head lowered, "You too. Although Cara forbade you from using your abilities in the camp, His Highness won't. On the contrary, he will only encourage everyone to master their abilities as much as possible through practice."



"My ability will bring trouble to the sisters," Miya said softly.



"That also requires practice," Wendy said decisively, "it's a matter of life and death."



"Life and death?" Leaf couldn't help asking.



"That's right, Prince Roland has discovered a way for witches to safely get through their Awakening Day," Nightingale took over for Wendy, "From now on, we can say goodbye to the pain of magic backlash, and all sisters can smoothly live to adulthood."



All the witches widened their eyes and looked at Nightingale, hardly daring to believe their own ears. Scroll asked in surprise, "Is it Miss Anna you mentioned last time? But you said you weren't clear about the specific reasons then."



"Yes, it was just His Highness's guess at that time, but Nana's Awakening Day later confirmed itâ€”she also didn't suffer any harm."



"So, what is this method..." Scroll couldn't help but hold her breath.



"As long as you consume magic power every day," Nightingale said word by word, "I can see the changes in magic in the mist, and regular use of it will make the total capacity that the body can accommodate continuously increase, while reducing the suffering of magic devouring the body. When approaching the Awakening Day, as long as you completely exhaust the magic power, it will hardly cause any harm to the body."



"I think everyone can also vaguely feel it," Wendy added, "In the days when we were hunted and killed by the Church, we carefully hid in the corners of towns, and dared not use our abilities, so many sisters left us every winter. But this year, in the camp at the Impassable Mountain Range, except for Aining and Ashes, everyone lived through the Evil Months."



So that's how it is, Leaf took a deep breath, this was the reason why her own encounter with the demonic devouring in the Barbarian Land was especially brief. "That is to say, the Holy Mountain is not in that uninhabited land..."



"That's right, the Holy Mountain is not a specific place," Wendy nodded. "Any place that can accept us, does not view witches as devils, and does not restrict the sisters from using their abilities, is the Holy Mountain."

"Wendy also once made a request to His Highness Roland, wanting to make a trip back to the camp after the Evil Months to tell everyone the news," Nightingale said softly, looking at Wendy. "Even if you haven't found the Holy Mountain, you can still live well in the depths of the mountains."

"Now that everyone has come back, there's no need to mention that," Wendy said with a smile and shook her head. "So, whether His Highness needs your abilities or not, for your own safety, you must practice them every day."

"Could it be that other witches have already realized this key to neutralizing the backlash of magic?" Scroll pondered for a moment before speaking, "We are not the first witch organization to gather together. In the Dawn and Wolfsheart Kingdoms, there are other witch unions that exist, and I have sent letters to them, inviting them to search for the Holy Mountain together, but I have never received a reply."

Leaf sighed softly, knowing that Scroll had left some words unsaid. Ever since Cara discovered the ancient book in an underground ruin in the Eastern Region's forest, she had resolutely led everyone on the road to finding the Holy Mountain. Since then, the Cooperative Association started a long journey of exile, crossing almost the entire Greycastle. Along the way, they met many new sisters and also lost many. If from the start, they had chosen to hide in that ruin, might they have discovered this key earlier?

"We can try to contact the witches hiding in other cities," Nightingale said, "His Highness Roland also has this intention. He wants to spread rumors to get the attention of the witches to this remote little town. If we act as intermediaries, there is no doubt that it will greatly reduce their wariness."

"But I still don't understand, what exactly is Prince His Highness sheltering us for?" Echo looked confused, this foreign woman from the far southern border had suffered more than most witches. She was first sold to a merchant at Clearwater Harbor by the Sand People, and then trafficked all the way to the royal capital. She was forced to learn dancing, court etiquette, and even the skills to please men. If it weren't for the fortuitous rescue by the Cooperative Association, she would probably have been sold at a high price to some duke or minister. Even now, her speech still carried a distinct foreign accent.

"Maybe it's the same as those people who wanted to buy you," Lily said with a sneer, "Men..."

"Don't talk nonsense, Lily," Nightingale said displeased, "His Highness Roland is different from those people. As long as everyone stays here for a while, you will naturally understand."



"That's exactly how I feel," Wendy still had that gentle smile, "It's getting late today, everyone should go back to their rooms and sleep. Even if your abilities don't work, there's no need to worry. His Highness has said before that he wants the witches in his domain to live a life just like normal people. If you really want to know what His Highness will have you do tomorrow," she paused deliberately, "I think it will probably start with filling out a contract."



Leaf and Scroll returned to their own room, with the latter casually closing the door, "Let's go to sleep as well."



"Okay." Earlier, when they asked about abilities, His Highness had arranged for her and Scroll to stay in one room, indicating that this was only a temporary arrangement and that in the future, the town would provide brand new single rooms. But in her opinion, the bed was so spacious that it could easily fit three people.



She took off her coat, crawled into the blanket, and was instantly enveloped by an indescribable softness and comfort. Leaf couldn't help but hum softly and buried her head in the pillow. After a long time, she quietly asked, "Do you blame Cara?"



"..." Scroll sighed softly, "No one can predict the future, no matter what she did later, at least at the beginning she truly wanted to find a sanctuary where witches could live in peace. Bringing this up now is meaningless, sleep, child."



She closed her eyes, "Good night."
