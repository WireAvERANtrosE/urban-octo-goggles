## Last Wish
Phyllis was not unfamiliar with the basement of the Silt Manor.

As a child, he had treated this place as his own playground, finding all sorts of odd things in the dust-covered boxes was a great delight. Of course, he had been beaten by his father for this more than once, and was eventually forbidden to enter the basement alone, but Phyllis always found ways to sneak in.

The lord led him to the innermost stone chamber, where the walls were inlaid with fist-sized pale blue crystals—Phyllis couldn't help but take a deep breath. Each stone was a top-grade Divine Stone of Judgement. He had been ignorant of their significance as a child, but now he understood what it meant. High-quality Divine Stones were extremely valuable, and ones as large as these would be worth at least five to six hundred Gold Royals each.

Was the Silt family really that wealthy?

Suddenly, he remembered that the treasure map had also been found in this room.

There was a circle of boxes placed around the stone chamber, arranged almost exactly as he remembered them. Sir Silt took out a bunch of keys and opened the largest wooden box. As the creaking sound of the lid opening filled the room, a cloud of dust arose.

Phyllis held his breath and looked inside the box—it was divided into several layers, similar to a noble lady's jewelry box, with each layer containing gems of various colors.

Was this the legacy of that ancestor?

"I have not visited this place in a long time," the lord sighed, "Every time I see these magic stones, I am reminded of the heavy past that our ancestor spoke of."



“Magic Stone?” Phyllis exclaimed in surprise.



“Yes, a precious item that can only be used by witches,” he nodded, “It’s a very long story. Our family was established under the protection of a witch.”



The father began to narrate the family's origin story, which was different from what Phyllis had heard as a child. The first ancestor of the Sylvie family did not come from the West, but from the impassable mountains in the wilderness, a place untouched by man.



Phyllis's eyes gradually widened in astonishment; he had not expected that such an astounding secret lay hidden behind the portrait.



The founder of their family, the ancestor Agatha, had astonishingly established a vast kingdom together with many other witches. In this kingdom, they held a ruling status, similar to the current nobility, and the reason for the kingdom's fall was an attack by the devils from hell. In the last battle, the survivors scattered and fled, Agatha led a group to the Misty Forest to retrieve experimental materials from a stone tower, while another group followed the main force to Greycastle — at that time, the land of the kingdom was still a backward and barren wasteland.



“Our ancestor was among that other group?” Phyllis asked with a dry throat.



“Correct, he was the witches’ steward, and by rights should have gone to the forest with her, but he backed out, volunteering to stay behind to look after the supplies, and the witch agreed to his request,” the knight said gravely, “You should understand what this means.”



Phyllis nodded. A steward could be considered the most trusted person by the master within the family, aside from relatives. In most cases, the steward should share life and death with the master, unless the master had other commands. Volunteering to leave, in some sense, was no different from betrayal, even if the other party did not refuse.



“After arriving in the West, our ancestor fell into deep regret and self-reproach, and he recorded all these emotions,” Sir Sylvie took out a black leather book from another chest, “The witch never returned, and after that, he severed contact with the Union, left the refugee camp, and with only a handful of servants, he settled down in this undeveloped land on his own.”



Phyllis took the black leather book but did not immediately open it. Instead, she thought of a terrifying aspect, "Does this mean that you knew from the very beginning that everything the Church did was wrong?"

If witches once dedicated themselves to fighting against the devils, why are they now being portrayed as the minions of devils? There was obviously a great secret hidden within.

"I knew, but I was powerless," the knight said calmly, "If a witch appeared in my territory, I would certainly hide her, but I was unable to save the witches in the fortress. After all, Duke Ryan does not think the same way—he even despises witches more than the Church does. Also, from the records of several of my ancestors, it is known that they did the same... they just never told those lucky ones who were saved about the Witch Kingdom."

"Are they still within the family?"

"How could that be possible? Of course, they have all entered the grave," he said, spreading his hands, "Living to sixty or seventy years old is already quite rare, but in the end, they were human and would grow old."

"But you think that the ancestor is still alive."

"It's just a possibility—witches have a variety of abilities and cannot bear offspring, so I made this conjecture."

Phyllis pondered for a moment and changed the subject, "Didn't the ancestors think about going to the Misty Forest to search for Ancestor Alice?"

"That's easier said than done," the father shook his head, "Even witches can't return safely, and it's no different from seeking death for ordinary mortals to go there. Plus, the Western Border was a wasteland four hundred years ago, filled with wild beasts and jungles. It was already extremely difficult to take root, let alone to attend to other matters. However, the ancestors did write this point in their will, hoping that future generations could go to the stone tower in the Misty Forest, even if it was just to take a look."



Dawnlight took a deep breath and opened the long-sealed record book. From the first page, he could feel the regret between the lines. Many of the words had become blurred over time, but it was precisely because of this that the heavy feeling became more apparent. It was unknown how much time had passed before he finally turned to the last page, where the content of the will was written. Perhaps it could not be called a will, but rather an unfulfilled wish.



This was probably also the reason for the regretful expression on his father's face after drinking.



As a former knight, he could empathize with this feeling.



"Do you need me to find her for you?" Phyllis asked after a moment of silence. "If she is indeed Agatha herself, then she must be living in the prince's castle. As far as I know, many witches are gathered there."



"All the witches are gathered in the castle?" Sir Silt pondered thoughtfully. "No wonder the Longsong Stronghold issued a recruitment notice for witches a few days ago. It seems that His Highness has made up his mind to oppose the Church." He then shook his head, "No, you need not go find her."



Phyllis was slightly startled. "Don't you want to see her once?"



"It's not fitting for an ancestor to come to see the descendants," Sir Silt said with a smile. "Of course, we should be the ones to actively go see her."



"We...?"



"That's right, I will also accompany you to Border Town," the father said, stroking his chin with a smile. "Take all these things with you. If she really is Agatha herself, the ancestor's last wish can also be fulfilled."
