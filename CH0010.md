## Stonemason
The weather this week has been consistently poor, with a perpetual grey haze overhead. Karl Barton's mood was as gloomy as the weather, sinking to rock bottom.



Walking on the damp cobblestone streets, he was greeted from time to time by the people—Karl ran an academy in this small town. Unlike the academies in Greycastle that only noble scions could attend, his was open to the children of the common folk as well. Therefore, in Border Town, he held considerable prestige.



"Hey, Mr. Barton, good morning."



"Sir, is my son doing well?"



"Have some free time, Karl? Let's go fishing together."



Usually, Karl would respond to them with a smile, but today he just nodded, not uttering a single word.



Ever since he witnessed Anna's execution, his view of the world had fractured—or perhaps the crack had always been there since he left Greycastle, but he had deliberately ignored it. He numbed himself with his busy work, and the innocent, pure smiles of his students somewhat veiled the fracture.



It was not until Anna's death that he realized the world had not changed at all. The crack had not disappeared; on the contrary, it had widened.



His memories of Anna were halted half a year ago. She wasn't particularly noticeable among the more than thirty children in the academy, average in appearance and not much of a talker, but there was one thing that left a deep impression on Karl.



That was her passion for knowledge. No matter what he taught, be it writing or history, she was always the first to remember. Even the history of the evolution of religion, which he himself found tedious, she could hold a book and read all day long. He had also seen the young girl help take care of the neighbor's sheep—under the sun, Anna carefully brushed the lamb's fur, her movements as gentle as if caring for a baby. He still remembered that scene very clearly to this day, the girl's smile sweet and pleasant, and in no way could be associated with evil.



Later, a fire broke out in the neighborhood, and Anna's mother unfortunately passed away. Anna stopped coming to the academy. It was not until a week ago that she was proven to be a witch and was hanged in the town center square.



Tempted by the devil? Impure? Evil? All nonsense! For the first time, he doubted the Church, and for the first time, he doubted the knowledge he imparted.



Whether Anna was a witch, he did not know, but the word evil certainly did not apply to her! If a girl, not yet of age, naive and curious about the world, could also be called evil, then the officials in Greycastle were the real devils from hell! For a few hundred Gold royals, they deliberately switched materials, causing the collapse of the new district's theater construction, and more than thirty members of the Stonemason's Guild lost their lives.



But were they put on the scaffold? Not one! In the end, the judge sentenced the leader of the Stonemason's Guild to be improper in construction and exiled, and the Guild was ordered to dissolve. And Karl, knowing the inside story, had to take his family and flee Greycastle to avoid the limelight, heading west until he finally arrived at Border Town.



He set up an academy, had many students, made new neighbors, new friends, but the crimes performed in Greycastle were always imprinted in his mind. Now, he once again felt the mockery of the world—what exactly is evil, and can the gods in heaven really see clearly?



The last straw for Karl was Nana.



Nana was different from Anna, one could even say the complete opposite. She was an extremely lively girl, quite famous in the academy. Whenever she was not in class, it was rare to see her rest—either riding in the trees to tease birds or rolling in the grass. When asked what she was doing, she would giggle for a good while before answering that she was listening to grasshoppers and ants quarrel.



Nana's face was always full of smiles, which seemed to be her nature. This miserable and difficult world had nothing to do with her; at least in the academy, she could always laugh carefree. Karl even had a bit of curiosity—had she ever cried from birth to now?



Until two days ago, Nana came to him with a tear-streaked face, "Teacher, will I be hanged like Anna?"

Only then did he realize that his own student, Nana Pine, had also become a witch.



"Ah, isn't that Mr. Barton! Please come over here and help us read what's written on this."

Karl felt someone tugging at his sleeve. He looked up and found himself unwittingly near the town square. A crowd of people was clamoring around the bulletin board, and upon hearing Barton's name, they all conscientiously made way.



"You've come at just the right time, sir. Please help us take a look."

"Yes, it was always that guy Meg who read it, but he said he had a stomachache and went to the toilet, and he hasn't come back until now."

Normally, he would certainly nod with a smile and then explain the contents of the bulletin board to everyone in detail. But now, Karl found he couldn't do it—their smiles and enthusiasm didn't seem feigned, but to him, they were harder to bear than a mask with a forced smile.



The notice of Anna's hanging was also posted up there, and everyone discussed it with the same high spirits. In a sense, you are all murderers, he said to himself; your ignorance and folly killed her.



Karl suppressed his emotions, took a deep breath, and walked up to the bulletin board.



"The Prince is recruiting manpower to build Border Town, with various grades of work available," he read.

But I am also one of the killers, what right do I have to blame them? Wasn't it me who told them that witches are evil? Karl just felt a bitter taste in his mouth, looking at what he had told the children, preaching the Church's doctrine by the book, and even thinking he did a good job, damn it!



"Stone breakers, male required, aged 20 to 40, physically strong. Daily remuneration of 25 Bronze royals."



"Mason, gender not specified, over 18 years old, with masonry experience, daily remuneration of 45 Bronze royals."



"Laborers, male required, over 18 years old, daily remuneration of 12 Bronze royals."



"..."



No, he must do something, if Anna's death was irreversible, then at least he couldn't let Nana follow in her footsteps. There was a voice in Karl's heart calling out, he did not stand up when the Stonemason Association was destroyed, he did not stand up when Anna was hanged, was he going to remain silent, watching these lovely children be sent to the gallows?



But what could he do? Escape from Border Town with Nana—He had his own family; his family had struggled from Greycastle to get here, and just when things were starting to improve, to leave again? Not to mention Nana herself came from a well-off family, could she endure a life with no fixed abode?



"Stonemason, gender not specified, age not specified, anyone who has participated in municipal construction, strongholds, fortifications, and the like, the City Hall is recruiting long term, monthly remuneration of 1 Gold royal."



"Supplementary clause: Those with rich experience and excellent performance can be granted official positions."

After the announcement was read, the crowd had already become noisy. "A compensation of 1 Gold Royal per month, that's on par with the cavalry of Longsong Stronghold!"

"But can you do it? You can't even build a proper latrine, let alone a stronghold."

"Don't just focus on that, the first few items are also pretty good. If they pay daily, it doesn't amount to much less than hunting."

"Indeed, hunting could cost you your life, and the Misty Forest is not a place you can just wander into casually."

Karl Barton paid no attention to these discussions; his entire focus was on the seal and signature at the end of the notice. It was the autograph of Fourth Prince Roland Wimbledon.

Could the prince be unaware that the Evil Months are coming soon? No matter what he wanted to build, starting now was not a good time. It seemed that His Highness had no clue about construction. If he could get the prince's attention using the name of the Stonemason's Guild... A thought suddenly sprang into Karl's mind. Perhaps through this recruitment, he could meet the prince in person—the supreme ruler of Border Town.

This thought made Karl swallow hard. Convince the prince that witches are not evil? Rumor had it that His Highness had unconventional ideas, was different from ordinary people, and had a strong dislike for the Church. It might just work! He thought, although it was Prince Roland who ultimately ordered Anna to be hanged, it was clear he did so reluctantly.

The prince himself was just over twenty years old; he should be able to understand more easily. How could those girls, still in the flower of their youth, suddenly turn into unforgivable embodiments of evil?



Of course, there was another possibility—that he would be considered an accomplice to the witch and be sent to the gallows along with her. The Church's laws clearly stipulated that anyone who sheltered a witch or pleaded on behalf of one should be regarded as a willing heretic.



He could only hope that the prince who detested the Church would likewise treat the Church's laws as waste paper.

Karl prayed in his heart.



Despite not knowing to which deity he should pray, he still closed his eyes and sought blessings.

For the deceased Anna, for the still-living Nana, and for the fissures in his heart to cease widening.

He decided to take the risk.
