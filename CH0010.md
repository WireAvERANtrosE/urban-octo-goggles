## Stonemason
The weather this week has not been good, with a constant grey haze overhead, and Karl Barton's mood is as low as the weather.

Walking on the damp cobblestone streets, people greet him from time to time—in this small town, Karl runs an academy. Unlike the academies in Greycastle that only noble children could attend, he also teaches the children of ordinary folk. Therefore, in Border Town, he has quite a high reputation.

"Hey, Mr. Barton, good morning."

"Sir, how is my son doing?"

"When you have time, Karl, let's go fishing together."

Usually, Karl would respond to them with a smile, but today he just nodded, not saying a word.

Ever since he witnessed Anna's execution, the world in his eyes began to crack—or rather, the crack had always been there since he left Greycastle, but he deliberately turned a blind eye to it. He numbed himself with busy work, and the innocent smiles of his students covered up the cracks to some extent.

It wasn't until Anna's death that he realized the world had not changed at all. The crack had not disappeared; instead, it had widened.

His memory of Anna stopped six months ago. She was not conspicuous among the more than thirty children in the academy, ordinary-looking, not very talkative, but one thing left a deep impression on Karl.

That was her passion for knowledge. No matter what he taught, be it language or history, she was always the first to remember. Even the history of religious evolution, which he himself found dry, she could hold the book and read all day long. He had also seen the young girl helping to care for her neighbor's sheep—in the sunshine, Anna carefully brushed the lambs' wool, her movements as gentle as caring for a baby. He still remembers that scene very clearly, the girl's smile sweet and pleasant, in no way could be associated with evil.

Later, there was a fire in the district, Anna's mother unfortunately passed away, and Anna stopped coming to the academy. Until a week ago, she was proven to be a witch and was hanged in the town's central square.

Tempted by the devil? Impure? Evil? It was all bullshit! For the first time in his heart, he doubted the Church, and for the first time, he doubted the knowledge he taught.

Whether Anna was a witch, he did not know, but the word evil could not be further from her! If a girl who was not yet of age, naive and curious about the world, could also be called evil, then the officials in Greycastle were the devils from hell! For a few hundred Gold royals, they deliberately substituted inferior materials, causing the collapse of the new district theater halfway through construction, and more than thirty members of the stonemason's guild died as a result.

But did they end up on the scaffold? Not a single one! The judge finally sentenced the leader of the stonemason's guild to exile for improper construction, and the guild was ordered to disband. And Karl, who knew the inside story, had to flee Greycastle with his family to avoid the limelight, heading west, and finally arrived in Border Town.

He set up an academy, had many students, met new neighbors, new friends, but the crimes committed in Greycastle were always imprinted in his mind. Now, he once again felt the world's mockery—what exactly is evil, can the gods in heaven really see clearly?

The last straw for Karl was Nana.



Nana is different from Anna, quite the opposite, in fact. She is an extremely lively girl, well-known in the academy. Whenever she is not in class, she is scarcely seen resting; either she is climbing trees to tease birds or rolling around on the grass. When asked what she is doing, she would first laugh heartily for a good while before answering that she is listening to grasshoppers and ants argue.



Nana's face is always filled with a smile, it seems to be her nature. This miserable and difficult world has nothing to do with her, at least in the academy, she can keep on laughing carefree. Karl even felt a bit curious—has she ever cried since she was born?



It wasn't until two days ago that a tearful Nana came to him, "Teacher, will I be hanged like Anna?"



That was when he realized that his student, Nana Pine, had also become a witch.



"Ah, isn't that Mr. Barton! Please come this way, help us see what's written here."



Karl felt someone tugging at his sleeve, and when he looked up, he realized he had somehow wandered to the side of the town square. A crowd of people was making noise around the bulletin board, and upon hearing Barton's name, everyone consciously made way.



"You've come at just the right time, sir, please help us read it."



"Yes, it was always Meg who read it, but he said he had a stomachache and went to the toilet, and he hasn't come back yet."



Under normal circumstances, he would certainly nod with a smile and explain the contents of the bulletin board to the crowd in detail. But now, Karl found he couldn't do it—their smiles and enthusiasm didn't seem fake, but to him, they were more unbearable than wearing a mask of a false smile.



The notice of Anna's hanging had also been posted up like this, and everyone had discussed it with great excitement. In a certain sense, you are all murderers, he thought, your ignorance and stupidity killed her.



Karl suppressed his emotions, took a breath, and walked to the front of the bulletin board.



"The prince is recruiting labor to build Border Town, with a variety of jobs available," he read.



But I am also one of the murderers, so what right do I have to blame them? Wasn't it me who told them that witches are evil? Karl felt a bitter taste at the corner of his mouth, thinking about what he had told the children, preaching the church's doctrines as if they were good, to hell with it!



"Stonebreakers, male, 20 to 40 years old, strong and healthy. Daily pay of 25 Bronze royals."



"Masons, gender not specified, 18 years and older, with masonry experience, daily pay of 45 Bronze royals."



"Laborers, male, 18 years and older, daily pay of 12 Bronze royals."



"......"

No, he had to do something. If Anna's death was irrevocable, at least he couldn't let Nana follow in her footsteps. A voice in Karl's heart was shouting; he had not stepped forward when the Stonemason Association was on the brink of collapse, nor when Anna was hanged. Was he going to stay silent forever, watching these lovely children being sent to the gallows?



But what could he do? Flee Border Town with Nana—when he had his own family? Having drifted from one place to another all the way from Greycastle, should they uproot their lives just when things were starting to look up? Not to mention that Nana herself came from a wealthy family. Could she endure a life of constant wandering?



"Stonemason, gender and age unrestricted, anyone who has participated in civic construction, fortresses, or military works is welcome. City Hall is recruiting long-term, with a monthly salary of 1 Gold Royal."



"Additional clause: Experienced individuals with outstanding performance may be granted official positions."



After the notice was read, the crowd was already abuzz. "A monthly salary of 1 Gold Royal, that's on par with the cavalry of Longsong Stronghold!"



"But can you do it? You can't even build a stable fence, let alone a fortress."



"Don't just focus on that, the first few items are also quite good. If they pay daily, it doesn't amount to much less than hunting."



"Indeed, hunting could cost you your life, and Misty Forest is not a place you can just wander into."



Karl Barton paid no attention to these discussions; his entire focus was on the seal and the signature at the end of the notice. It was the personal signature of the Fourth Prince, Roland Wimbledon.



Didn't the prince know that the Months of Demons was approaching? No matter what he wanted to build, now was not a good time to start construction. It seemed like His Highness Wimbledon had no clue about construction. If he could get the prince's attention using the name of the Stonemason Association... An idea suddenly popped into Karl's mind. Perhaps through this recruitment, he could meet the prince in person—the supreme ruler of Border Town.



This thought made Karl swallow hard. Convince the prince that witches weren't evil? Rumor had it that Prince Roland had unique ideas, a personality different from ordinary people, and a strong dislike for the Church. Maybe it would work! He thought, although it was Prince Roland who had ultimately ordered Anna's execution, it was clear he did so reluctantly.



The prince himself was only in his early twenties. He should be more understanding—how could those girls, still in the bloom of youth, suddenly become sinners deserving of such unforgivable evil?



Of course, there was another possibility: that he would be considered an accomplice to the witches and be sent to the gallows himself. Church law clearly stipulated that anyone who shielded a witch or pleaded on a witch's behalf should be regarded as a fallen evildoer.



He could only hope that the prince, who loathed the Church, would also treat the Church's laws as waste paper.



Karl prayed in his heart.



Although he didn't know which deity to pray to, he still closed his eyes and sought blessings. 

For the deceased Anna, for the still living Nana, so that the cracks in his heart would no longer widen. 

He decided to take this risk.
