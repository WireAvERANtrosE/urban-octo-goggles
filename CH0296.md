## Witch
As Maggie carried Nightingale into the fray, the tide of battle turned in an instant.

The devil let out an angry roar, forced to abandon the chase of the nimble Lightning, and with a tumbling dive, it lunged straight at Maggie. Its arm, still not fully recovered, raised the spear again, and it swelled swiftly, cracks splitting its skin as blood mist sprayed out.

The attack was still heavy and forceful, but the thrown spear no longer possessed its initial might, at least Nightingale could barely track the trajectory of the spear shaft.

"Maggie!" she patted the behemoth beneath her, then unfolded the Mist and took a step forward.

"Ow— coo!" Maggie's form shrank dramatically, turning back into a pigeon.

The large target vanished abruptly, and the spear, whistling as it went, sped between the two and plummeted into the sea.

In the next instant, Nightingale, emerging from the Mist, was back atop the transformed Maggie, the entire evasion as smooth as flowing water.

The devil let out a pained howl, its arm beginning to retract inward, and ultimately breaking off inch by inch, like branches stripped of moisture. Yet its left hand still clutched the reins, directing its mount in a head-on collision with the two, seemingly determined to perish together.

Maggie, of course, would not grant its wish. Just before the imminent crash, she suddenly dipped, brushing past the enemy. When she regained her balance, Nightingale was already gone from her back.



The latter appeared behind the devil like a ghost.

The enemy scrambled to untie the ropes binding their body, but Nightingale naturally did not give them the chance.

She pulled the trigger in a furious release, and the gunshots rang out in succession.

This round of shooting not only pierced through the devil's back shell but also penetrated its chest cavity. The enemy let out a series of hoarse gasps and quickly fell into the blood mist.

The demon beast, now masterless, was also killed by the arriving Lightning, falling into the sea and soon disappearing without a trace.

The Seagull slowly descended near the shore.

"What should we do next?" Nightingale anxiously looked towards Anna, as only she could remain calm at times like this.

"We've been delayed for so long that even with night flying, the hot air balloon will only reach the town by midnight," Anna said word for word, "Prince Roland must be carried by Lightning and Maggie and set out first."

"No problem, woof!" The demon beast's huge head said next to them, opening its gaping maw.



"I... am also fine, leave it to us." The little girl looked somewhat dejected, probably feeling that as an adventurer, her fear of battling the enemy had led everyone into this predicament.

Nightingale patted her head, "No one is born adept at these things; it's not your fault."

The witches tied the unconscious His Highness to Maggie's back while Lightning carried the severed hand. The two quickly took to the sky and flew towards the town along the Redwater River.

"What about us?" Wendy asked, "I don't have much magic power left."

"Keep flying, as far as we can. The enemy might send a second team to search for us, we're too close to the snow mountain, we need to leave quickly," Anna said, "Once we're in a safe area, we'll find a hidden place to land and set up camp."

Her decision was met with unanimous agreement from the remaining witches.

The Castle in the Sky rose again, now with only five people remaining in the basket.

"How on earth did the demons find us?" Sorya wondered, "The hot air balloon and basket are both painted with sky camouflage, it's hard to make out even with a spyglass at an altitude of over two thousand meters."

"A gigantic demon," Sylvie frowned deeply, "It was squatting on top of a black spire, with a head larger than its body, covered in countless eyes. I only glanced at it... and all its eyes turned to look at me. Then, hundreds of demons surged out from the ground, the whole area was like it was boiling."



"Is there really such a monster?" Soria gasped in astonishment.



"Not only that, those two flying mounts are also very strange," Anna mused. "The blood that flowed out of them when they were shot was not black like ink, but deep blue—this is completely different from the hybrid demonic beasts encountered by Evil Months."



"It's more similar to devils," Soria added, "The first devil that Nightingale shot bled blue blood."



"Could it be that they are not demonic beasts?" Sylvie asked.



"I don't know... But it's really great that Maggie can transform into their appearance," Wendy sighed. "If it weren't for her saving Nightingale, we might all have been in danger."



"Her abilities have evolved," Nightingale, who had been silent, suddenly spoke. "In my mist state, I saw that the magic power inside her is no longer a swirling vortex, but has taken on a fixed form—a pair of spread-out white wings."



...

Lightning hugged His Highness's arm, filled with guilt.



The devil was only fierce in appearance and was not overwhelmingly powerful in the air. If she had left the basket from the beginning and gone to intercept the enemy, His Highness would not have suffered such serious injuries.



Standing up to protect one's companions is an adventurer's unshirkable responsibility. When exploring the Fjords, Thunder always led the charge against any danger, leading everyone through one challenge after another, never taking a step back, whether it was fighting pirates or confronting deep-sea behemoths.



For the first time, Lightning realized how far she still was from becoming an outstanding explorer.

However, her father had also mentioned that fear could be overcome through understanding and familiarity, and skills could be mastered through repeated training.

She made up her mind that once His Highness's injuries were healed, she would ask him for a specialized handgun and request that Nightingale teach her shooting and combat skills.



"How is His Highness doing, coo?" Maggie mumbled, her voice hoarse and murky compared to her usual pigeon-like cooing, like the wind blowing out of a stone cave, "I feel his body is getting colder, coo."

The little girl clenched her fists and turned to fly onto Maggie's back.



Roland was seen with his eyes tightly closed, his lips pale, and his messy gray hair made him look lifeless. The blood on his clothes had already coagulated, and the charred wounds looked too horrific to bear. She gently placed her hand on his neck, and the faint pulse proved that the prince was still alive, but the touch of her fingertips was frighteningly cold.



"How much magic power do you have left?" Lightning estimated the distance, "We need to move at full speed now."

"Alright, coo!"



By the time the two reached Border Town, the young girl felt dizzy and her vision blurred. The excessive speed not only drained her magic power quickly but also placed a great strain on her body. She clenched her teeth and used the last of her strength to land directly in the front yard of the castle. Hearing the commotion and seeing the guards rushing over with their guns, she shouted, "Quickly fetch Miss Nana, His Highness the Prince is injured!"
