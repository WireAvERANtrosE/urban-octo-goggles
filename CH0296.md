## Demon Witch
After Maggie carrying Nightingale joined the battle, the situation instantly reversed.

The devil let out an angry roar, forced to give up chasing the nimble Lightning, and with a roll, it dove straight towards Maggie. The arm, not yet fully recovered, was raised again with the spear growing rapidly in size, its surface bursting with cracks as a mist of blood sprayed out.

The strike was still forceful, but the thrown spear no longer possessed its initial might; at least Nightingale could just barely make out the trajectory of its flight.

"Maggie!" She patted the giant beast beneath her, then unfolded the Mist and stepped forward.

"Ow—coo!" Maggie's form rapidly shrank, turning back into a pigeon in an instant.

As the large target abruptly disappeared, the spear whistled past where the two had been and plummeted towards the sea.

In the next moment, Nightingale, who emerged from the Mist, was back on the transformed Maggie's back, the entire dodging process smooth and flowing.

The devil let out a pained wail as its arm began to contract inwards, eventually breaking off piece by piece, like a branch deprived of moisture. But its left hand still tightly grasped the reins, steering its mount to charge directly at the two, seemingly determined to take them down with it.

Maggie, of course, would not comply with its wishes. Just before the collision, she suddenly dipped down, brushing past the enemy. When balance was regained, Nightingale had already vanished from her back.



The latter appeared behind the devil like a ghost.

The enemy clumsily attempted to untie the ropes binding their body, but Nightingale naturally wouldn't give them the chance.

She pulled the trigger as if venting her anger, and the gunshots rang out continuously.

This round of shooting not only penetrated the devil's carapace but also its chest cavity. The enemy let out a series of hoarse gasps and quickly fell amidst a mist of blood.

The demon beasts, now without a master, were also killed by the arriving Lightning and fell into the sea, soon disappearing without a trace.

The Seagull slowly descended near the coast.

"What should we do next?" Nightingale anxiously looked towards Anna, knowing that in times like this, probably only she could maintain her composure.

"We've been delayed so much that even accounting for night flight, the hot air balloon will need until midnight to reach the town," Anna said word by word, "Prince Roland must be carried by Lightning and Maggie and set out first."

"No problem, meow!" The magical beast's massive head said beside them, opening its bloody maw.



"I... am also fine, leave it to us," the little girl looked somewhat downcast, probably feeling that as an explorer, her fear of battling the enemy had led everyone into this predicament.

Nightingale patted her head, "No one is born excelling at these things, it's not your fault."



The witches strapped the unconscious His Highness onto Maggie's back, while Lightning carried the severed hand. The two quickly took to the sky, flying towards the town along the Redwater River.



"What about us?" Wendy asked, "I don't have much magic power left."



"Keep flying, as far as we can. The enemy might send a second team to search for us, we're too close to the Impassable Mountain Range, we need to get away as soon as possible," Anna said, "Once we reach a safe area, we'll find a secluded place to land and set up camp."



Her decision was unanimously approved by the remaining witches.



The Seagull rose again, now with only five people remaining in the basket.



"How exactly did the Devils find us?" Soria wondered, "The hot air balloon and the basket are both painted with sky camouflage, at an altitude of over two thousand meters, they would be hard to distinguish even with a spyglass."



"A giant Devil," said Sylvie with a furrowed brow, "it was squatting on top of a black spire with a head larger than its body, covered in countless eyes. I only glanced at it... and all its eyes turned to look at me. Then, hundreds of Devils surged out from the ground, the entire area was like boiling."



"There's actually such a monster?" Soraya gasped in astonishment.



"It's not just that, those two flying mounts are also very strange," Anna pondered, "The blood that flowed out after they were shot is not black like ink, but deep blue—this is completely different from the hybrid demonic beasts encountered by Evil Months."



"It's more similar to demons," Soraya added. "The first demon that Nightingale shot bled blue blood."



"Could it be that they are not demonic beasts?" Sylvie asked.



"I don't know… but it's really great that Maggie can transform into their shape," Wendy sighed, "If it wasn't for her saving Nightingale, we might all have been in danger."



"Her ability has evolved," Nightingale, who had been silent all along, suddenly spoke up, "In my Mist state, I saw that the magic power in her body is no longer a swirling vortex, but has turned into a fixed shape—a pair of spread out white wings."



…

Lightning was holding His Highness's arm, filled with guilt.



The demons were only fierce in appearance, and in the air, they weren't so powerful that they couldn't be dealt with. If she could have left the basket at the beginning and gone to intercept the enemy, His Highness wouldn't have been so seriously injured.



Standing up to protect one's companions is an explorer's undeniable duty. When adventuring in the Fjords, Thunder took the lead in facing any danger, guiding everyone through one difficulty after another. Whether it was battling pirates or confronting deep-sea behemoths, he never retreated a step.



Lightning realized for the first time that she was still very far from becoming an outstanding explorer.



However, her father had also mentioned that fear could be overcome through understanding and familiarity, and skills could be mastered through repeated training.



She made up her mind that once His Highness's injuries healed, she would ask him to gift her a special handgun and request Sister Nightingale to teach her shooting and combat skills.



"How is His Highness doing, coo?" Maggie mumbled, her voice hoarse and murky compared to when she cooed as a pigeon, like the wind blowing out of a stone cave. "I feel his body getting colder, coo."



The little girl clenched her fists and turned to fly onto Maggie's back.



They saw Roland with his eyes tightly closed, his lips pale, adding to his disheveled gray hair, he looked utterly lifeless. The blood on his clothes had already coagulated, and the charred wounds looked too ghastly to bear. She gently placed her hand on his neck, the faint pulse proved that the prince was still alive, but the touch of her fingertips was frighteningly cold.



"How much magic power do you have left?" Lightning estimated the distance. "We need to proceed at full speed."



"Alright, coo!"



By the time the two arrived at Border Town, the young girl was feeling dizzy and blurry-eyed. The excessive speed not only rapidly depleted her magic power but also placed a tremendous strain on her body. Clenching her teeth, she mustered her last bit of strength to land directly in the castle's front courtyard, shouting to the guards who came running over with guns at the noise, "Quickly call for Miss Nana, Prince Roland is injured!"
