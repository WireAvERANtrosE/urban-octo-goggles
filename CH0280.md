## Battle of Redwater River (Part 1)
The enemy fleet approached the Redwater River fork later than expected, taking half a day longer to arrive. It wasn't until the afternoon four days later that ten sailboats slowly appeared at the edge of the horizon.

Upon receiving the news, Tanner passed through six compartments in turn to issue the standby command to the gun crew he was responsible for before returning to his own gun position.

"Where's the enemy?" Rodney lifted the window shutter a crack to peer outside.

"They're still several hundred meters away from us," Moe, who was responsible for observing the signal flags, muttered as he lay by the skylight, "I can't even see their shadows from here; the weeds on the roof are too thick."

In addition to the firing windows, each compartment had a hole opened at the top near the wall. Climbing up a two-step earthen staircase allowed one to easily view the situation on the Redwater River.

"Speaking of weeds, the ability of that green-haired witch is simply incredible," Jop said as he wiped some rust off a cannonball, "Wherever she goes, the thin grass grows wildly like hair, covering those bunkers so tightly that they look just like ordinary mounds of earth."

"What green-haired witch," Tanner chided, "That's Miss Leaf. The first time we fought against the Duke's Knights, she helped us lay vines in the forests on both sides, preventing the knights from flanking us. Otherwise, we would have been in a lot of trouble if those tin cans managed to get behind us through the woods."

"If we're talking about wonders, which witch is ordinary?" Rodney shrugged, "Building fortresses overnight, covering the ground with vines and weeds, freely flying in the sky, or even transforming into a giant pigeon—none of these are things mortals can do."

"The most amazing for me is still Miss Nana," Moe said with longing and expectation in his tone, "I wonder if I'll have the honor of being wounded this time. If I do get hurt, I'll be able to see her up close, and maybe even hear her comforting words."



"Keep a sharp eye on the enemy!" Tanner frowned and barked, "Blather on again, and I'll have you sweeping the latrines as punishment!"

Moe stuck out his tongue and then leaned out again.



The artillery captain sighed inwardly. The men had lost their sense of tension and no longer shook with nerves as they had when first arriving on the battlefield months ago. He couldn't decide whether this change was good or bad, as it seemed they were taking their opponent too lightly. Yet, he could not harshly reprimand his subordinates, as he wasn't much better himself—ever since becoming a soldier under His Highness, Tanner's understanding of battle had undergone a radical transformation: Bloody and brutal combat no longer seemed to have anything to do with strength, skill, or courage. They just needed to repeat the procedures they had memorized during training; prepare according to regulations, meet the enemy according to regulations, and fire according to regulations to achieve victory.



Especially during the skirmish with the new king's militia in the small town, where the enemy was comprised of astonishingly strong, ferociously fearless humanoid beasts. Yet, the battle lasted only half an hour before it was over. Only when clearing the battlefield did he realize he didn't even feel a hint of fatigue, as if he had just done a warm-up exercise before training, and the enemy had already been routed.



If things continued to develop in this manner, would there come a day when conflict meant not even seeing the enemy's face, merely operating these metal machines to annihilate the enemy from miles away?



As Tanner was lost in his thoughts, Moe's warning cry brought him back.



"I see the enemy!"



"Load the ammunition!" Tanner shook his head to clear his thoughts and ordered in a deep voice.



The compartment immediately bustled with activity, this step having been practiced too many times; now everyone could stuff the powder bags and shells into the cannon with their eyes closed. Without the need to consider recoil and angle adjustments, the gun crew could fire once every twenty breaths.



Prince Roland and Lord Iron Axe had already laid out the battle plan, which Tanner had memorized perfectly—similar to the defense of Border Town, the signal to knock down the camouflage planks in front of the gun ports and open fire would only come when the observers saw Miss Lightning's red flag. The first and second gun crews closest to the riverbank were to sweep the decks with grapeshot, while the remaining crews were to bombard the cabins with solid shot.

He quietly awaited the arrival of the red signal flag.

...

Now, without the need for a spyglass, Lily could see the pseudo-king's fleet inching closer to the ambush point.

Compared to the three-masted or four-masted sailing ships that sailed the high seas, these vessels were clearly much more slender, lacking tall sides and railings, and their low hulls seemed to skim the surface of the river at first glance. In addition to the billowing sails, a row of sailors sat on either side of the deck, slowly propelling the oars in their hands.

Up to this point, His Highness had still not issued any commands.

She couldn't help feeling a bit anxious. The observation post was set up on top of a relatively high hillside, which allowed for an overview of the entire battlefield, but it was also quite far from the river channel. Now that Lightning and Maggie were not by His Highness's side, considering the time it would take for the messengers to relay orders to each squad, it might be too late to stop the fleet from passing through the fork of the Redwater River.

Just as the leading sailboat was about to pass by the earth house, Lily was on the verge of asking out loud when a sudden thunderous boom rolled across the river's surface. As if signaling an attack, more than a dozen plumes of thick smoke mixed with flames burst out from the earth house, and the dull sound of thunder continued without end.

What on earth had happened?



Lily refocused her gaze on the river, and she could hardly believe her eyes—she didn't see any knights or mercenaries engaged in battle. However, the deck of the first sailboat seemed to suddenly explode. Wooden splinters and severed limbs were flying everywhere, and the sailors rowing the oars were killed or injured in an instant. Clouds of blood mist rose, staining the deck a crimson red.



After losing half its power, the boat's speed quickly slowed down, and the roaring noise did not cease for a moment. Soon, the tall mast standing in the center of the ship was sheared off by a rising black shadow and, after swaying, it crashed down, crushing two knights who had just climbed out of the cabin onto the deck.



Driven by the current, the sailboat began to slowly move backward, forcing the other vessels to scatter and make way. Many people, hearing the commotion, came out from the cabins in succession, looking bewilderedly at the lead sailboat, which had turned into hell, appearing somewhat at a loss.



Then, the terrifying assault descended upon the second ship.



The densely packed deck resulted in an even more turbulent blood mist. After the thunderous rolling, Lily could see that several bright red clearings had suddenly appeared among the tightly packed enemies, where the unfortunate ones had been blasted into several pieces. Some were not yet dead, dragging their spilling intestines and wailing in pain. Meanwhile, the others who were lucky enough to survive jumped into the river to escape, no longer willing to spend another moment on that horrific deck.



She finally understood what His Highness meant by "they can't make it across." But... how did his subordinates manage to do this?
