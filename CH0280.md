## Redwater River Ambush (Part 1)
The enemy fleet approached the fork of the Redwater River half a day later than expected. It wasn't until the afternoon of the fourth day that ten sailboats slowly appeared at the edge of their view.



Upon receiving the news, Vanner passed through six compartments in succession and issued the standby order to the gun crew he was in charge of, before returning to his own gun position.



"Where's the enemy?" Rodney lifted the shutter of the window a crack and peered outside.



"They're still several hundred meters away from us," Cat's Claw, who was in charge of observing the signal flags, muttered as he lay on the skylight, "I can't even see their shadow from here, there are too many weeds on the roof."



In addition to the shooting windows, each compartment had a hole opened at the top near the wall. Climbing up a two-step earthen staircase made it easy to see the situation on the Redwater River.



"Speaking of weeds, the ability of that green-haired witch is simply incredible," Grapefruit wiped the slightly rusty cannonball and said, "Wherever she goes, the thin grass grows like hair, covering those bunkers so tightly that they look no different from ordinary mounds."



"What green-haired witch," Vanner scolded, "That's Miss Leaf. She helped us lay vines in the forests on both sides during our first confrontation with the Duke's Knightage, preventing the knights from flanking us. Otherwise, if those tin cans had come around through the forest to our back, we would have had a hard time."



"If we're talking about wonders, which witch is ordinary?" Rodney shrugged, "Building up bunkers overnight, covering the ground with vines and weeds, flying freely in the sky, or even transforming into a giant pigeon—these aren't things mortals can do."



"The most miraculous one for me is still Miss Nana," Cat's Claw said with yearning and anticipation in his voice, "I wonder if I'll have the honor of being wounded this time. If I do get hurt, I'll be able to see her up close, and maybe even hear her comforting words."



"Pay close attention to the enemy situation!" Vana frowned and scolded, "If you spout nonsense again, I'll have you punished by cleaning the toilets!"

Cat's Claw stuck out his tongue and then stretched out again.

The artillery captain sighed inwardly. The group had lost their sense of tension and no longer trembled with fear as they had when they first arrived on the battlefield months ago. He couldn't decide whether this change was good or bad, feeling that they were underestimating the enemy. But he couldn't reprimand his men too harshly because he was no better himself—since becoming a soldier under His Highness, Vana's understanding of combat had undergone a radical transformation: the bloody and brutal fighting seemed no longer related to strength, skill, or courage. They simply had to repeat the steps they had memorized during training, prepare according to the regulations, meet the enemy according to the regulations, and fire according to the regulations to achieve victory.



Especially during the skirmish with the new king's militia in the town, despite facing astonishingly strong and fearless humanoid beasts, the battle had ended in just half an hour. It was only when clearing the battlefield that he realized he didn't even feel a trace of fatigue, as if he had just done a warm-up exercise before training, and the enemy had already been defeated.



If things continued to develop this way, would there come a day when conflict meant not even seeing the enemy's face, simply operating these metal machines to annihilate the enemy from thousands of miles away?



As Vana was lost in his thoughts, Cat's Claw's warning pulled him back.

"I see the enemy!"

"Load the ammunition!" Vana shook his head to clear his thoughts and ordered in a deep voice.

The compartment immediately became busy. This step had been practiced too many times; now everyone could stuff the powder bags and shells into the cannon breech with their eyes closed. Without having to consider recoil and angle adjustments, the gun crew could fire once every twenty seconds.



Prince Roland and Lord Iron Axe's battle plan had long been memorized by Vanner — just like the defense of Border Town, they were to wait until the observers saw Miss Lightning's red flag before they could push down the camouflaged blockade in front of the gun ports and open fire. The first and second gun groups closest to the riverbank were to sweep the decks with canister shots, while the remaining groups were to bombard the cabins with solid shots.

He quietly waited for the arrival of the red signal flag.

...

Now, without the need for a telescope, Lily could see that the false king's fleet was inching closer to the ambush site.

Compared to the three-masted or four-masted sailing ships that traveled on the high seas, these vessels were obviously much slimmer, lacking tall bulwarks and railings, with low hulls that at first glance seemed to skim the river's surface. Besides the billowing sails, there were rows of sailors seated on either side of the deck, slowly pushing the oars in their hands.

Even now, His Highness had not issued any command.

She couldn't help feeling anxious; the observation post was set up on a higher slope, which allowed an overview of the entire battlefield but was also farther from the river. Now that both Lightning and Maggie were not by His Highness's side, considering the time it would take for the messenger soldiers to relay the orders to each team, it might be too late to stop the fleet from passing through the fork of the Redwater River.

As Lily was about to voice her concerns, with the leading sailboat about to pass the earthen house, a thunderous boom suddenly rolled across the river surface. As if signaling the attack, more than a dozen thick plumes of smoke mixed with fire spurted out from the earth house, and the dull sound of thunder continued incessantly.

What on earth had happened?



Lily redirected her gaze back to the river, and then almost couldn't believe her own eyes—she saw no knights or mercenaries engaged in battle, yet the deck of the first sailboat was in chaos as if a pot had exploded. Wooden splinters and severed limbs were flying everywhere, and the rowers were more than half dead or injured in an instant. Clouds of blood mist rose, staining the deck a bright crimson.



With half of its propulsion lost, the ship's forward speed quickly slowed down, while the roaring sound did not cease for a moment. Soon, the tall mast standing in the center of the ship was chopped off by a rising black shadow, wobbled twice, and then crashed down, striking down two knights who had just climbed out of the cabin onto the deck.



Pushed by the current, the sailboat began to slowly drift backward, forcing the other vessels to scatter and give way. Many people, hearing the commotion, filed out of the cabins one after another, looking bewilderedly at the lead sailboat that had turned into a hell, appearing somewhat at a loss.



Then, the terrifying assault descended upon the second ship.



The densely packed deck meant the blood mist was even more ferocious. Lily could see that, after the rolling thunder, several bright red clearings appeared among the closely packed enemies, where the unfortunate ones standing in the clearings were violently torn into pieces. Some were not yet dead and were wailing in pain, dragging their spilled intestines. The others, who had luckily survived, jumped into the river to escape, no longer willing to stay on this dreadful deck for another moment.



She finally understood what His Highness meant by "they won't be able to cross." But how did his subordinates achieve this?
