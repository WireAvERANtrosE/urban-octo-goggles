## Hermes Machinery
Bishop Maine walked down the circular staircase step by step, heading deep underground.

This was a naturally formed sinkhole, at least deep enough to swallow up four Towers of Heavens, with a diameter of about twenty-odd zhang, more than enough to fit an entire lord's castle. The well was not initially dim, as there were skylights on the high dome, and light streamed through the windows into the underground, leaving winding patterns of light on the icy stone walls.

As the descent continued, the patches of light gradually dimmed and soon merged with the stone walls. However, the center of the pit reflected a faint blue light, which became more apparent the further down one went, and even without a torch, one would not fall into the predicament of not being able to see one's own fingers.

The stairs underfoot were like a small snake wrapped around the pit, clinging tightly to the rock wall.

The stair slabs were cut from granite, rectangular in shape, three fingers thick, and wide enough for two people to walk side by side. One end was embedded in the rock wall, while the other end hung in the air. To prevent accidental falls, the hanging end had a wooden railing, with ropes connecting between the railings.

He had not counted how many steps there were, but he knew that laying each stone slab was an incredibly arduous task. The church's stonemasons relied on ropes to hang down and chisel out deep enough grooves in the hard rock, then inserted the slabs into them. Every movement had to be made with the utmost caution, as there were as many as three hundred people who had slipped or broken off the ropes and plummeted to the bottom of the pit.

If the Hermes Church built above was the symbol of the church's unyielding spirit, then the Hermes Institute deep within the well was the true core of the church.

Embedded in the stone walls beside the staircase were God's Stones of Retribution, and every hundred steps, there would be a member of the Judgement Army standing guard. Inside the mechanism, a squad of God's Punishment Army was always ready to meet any invaders. Between the dome and the floor of the church, many sandbags and rubble were buried. If the defense line of the Holy City were to fail, and everyone had to evacuate, the Pope would activate the trap, letting the sand and rubble completely bury this place.

Although it was not Maine's first time visiting the Hermes Institute, the feeling of walking in mid-air still made him dizzy. Especially when he looked around, he would always have the illusion that he was falling.



Only when his feet touched the solid ground did he breathe a sigh of relief.



At the bottom of the pit was a huge, disc-shaped piece of white grindstone, its surface as smooth as a mirror, upon which one could even clearly see one's own reflection. Through the ingenious design of the craftsmen, the light streaming in from the dome's skylight, after multiple refractions within the walls of the pit, would converge precisely upon this grindstone at the bottom of the hole. Even without lighting torches, the bottom of the pit was not shrouded in darkness.



Only when standing at the bottom could one realize that sunlight was not colorless. The grindstone reflected a faint blue light when illuminated, and looking up, the entire pit was lit with this blue light, presenting a cold hue. If one looked closely, they could also notice countless dust particles dancing in the brighter light, resembling the tiny creatures recorded in ancient books.



Utilizing the naturally formed holes in the walls at the bottom of the pit, the Church had connected and further expanded them, constructing the Hermes Plateau. It was thanks to these extensive interconnecting holes that the air circulation was smooth and brisk, completely free from the decayed and stifling sensation of being deep underground.



As Maine stepped through the gates of the machinery, the defensive forces became much more stringent. The Judgement Army was stationed at every checkpoint in groups of five—these were the Church's most loyal warriors, and once they took on this duty, they would spend their entire lives within the machinery, never to return to the surface again.



In fact, only he and the Pope had access to the machinery; even the two Archbishops, Hesse and Tayfun, were not permitted to set foot in this place.



But Maine was also unclear about how many branching paths there were within the machinery. Aside from this main passage heading due south, there were many side passages on both sides. Following them would often lead to even more branches. Some were utilized by the Church, while others were simply sealed off. He had heard that during the construction of the machinery, some craftsmen had mistakenly entered these unmarked side passages and lost their way, never to find the route back.



The straight main passage led deep into the mountain, with a checkpoint set up every thirty zhang (approximately 100 meters). Maine knew that the mechanisms between each section of checkpoints served different purposes. The outermost part was the living area, where the warriors stationed at the bottom of the pit resided. The second section was the archives, used for storing documents, fragments, and ancient texts. The third section was the prison area, confining some criminals who could not be exposed to light... and the innocent.



After passing three checkpoints, Maine stopped. Moving forward would lead to the confidential area of the machinery, where all the Church's research and inventions originated. Without the Pope's permission, he could not proceed on his own. Having served as an Archbishop for over three years, he had only been inside once.



Mayne turned to the left and entered a side passage.



The side passage was short, and it didn't take long before he reached the end. As the bishop appeared, the Judgement Army guards immediately clenched their fists to their chests and greeted, "My Lord!"



Mayne nodded, "Open the door."



Inside was a corridor with walls adorned with burning pine resin torches, like countless dancing points of light in the darkness, extending continuously towards the end of the walkway. On both sides were many thick wooden doors arranged in parallel, each with a number plate hanging in the middle.



The Judgement Warrior lifted a torch and led the way. Mayne walked and paid attention to the changing numbers on the plaques. When he saw the mottled door plate marked with the number thirty-five, he stopped, took out a key, inserted it into the keyhole, and gently twisted it. The sound of the lock opening was particularly harsh in the silence of the dungeon, with faint echoes coming from the end of the corridor. As if signaling, cries and howls came from behind many doors, from men and women alike. If one listened carefully, most were pleas like "Let me out!" "Save me!" "Please, just kill me!"



Mayne was unmoved. He commanded the warrior to stand guard at the door, then he entered the room, closed the wooden door, and shut out the chaotic noise.



Separated by iron bars, the bishop saw an old man sitting at the head of the bed—or perhaps he wasn't old, but now his hair was white, and his forehead was covered in wrinkles. His beard had not been shaved for a long time and almost reached his neck. Due to the lack of sunlight for a long time, his skin was a terrifying pale, and his limbs were as thin as sticks.



Mayne glanced at the meal box next to the iron bars. The food inside was almost untouched. He sighed, "You should treat yourself better; the church is not lacking this bit of food. Your meals are prepared according to the king's standards, except for the absence of wine. Even the fish is top-quality cod from Clearwater Harbor. You should be very familiar with its taste, shouldn't you, Your Majesty Wimbledon?"
