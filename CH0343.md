## Remolding Order
"Master, the city walls have been breached, and the allied forces probably won't hold out much longer! Let's get out of here!" 

She could already hear the sounds of fighting outside. Stepping out of the high tower, she saw the sky filled with dark clouds that let through a dim red light, as if wrapped in thick blood. 

"But my sister hasn't come back yet."

"She's a soldier of the defending army; she can't just leave her post," Karl's voice grew more and more anxious. "If you die here, wouldn't that betray her intentions!"

After hesitating for a while, she finally nodded in agreement. "I understand."

The streets were filled with refugees, and the guards were maintaining a precarious order. As she was swept into the flow of people, she couldn't help but follow the crowd towards the south gate, with Karl closely behind her, using his sturdy and tall figure to protect her from being knocked down by the panicked crowd.

It was a complete defeat.

Is this our end? She glanced back at the Tower of Babel, the tallest point of the city and the center of the union. Flying devils had already carried berserk demons to the top of the tower, and occasionally a bolt of lightning would strike and bring a devil down. But it was all in vain—the enemy was simply too numerous.

After hundreds of years of construction and development, this city had become the most prosperous holy city on the Fertile Plains. Yet today, it seemed as though it would be destroyed in an instant, and the efforts of generations could not save it—it was like a sandcastle built by children over an afternoon, needing only a blink of an eye to return to chaos and disorder.



Passing through the South Gate, those who could still fight spontaneously came forward to coordinate with the guards against the devils that had caught up with them.

But the enemy had not only Frenzied Demons, but also Fear Demons and a Hell Lord; the gap in strength between the two sides was too great. After a volley of spears, dozens lay in pools of blood, some with their bellies pierced and steaming intestines sliding into the cold snow, others merely had their limbs severed, clutching their wounds and wailing in pain.

"Master, what are you doing?" Kafra held her back.

"I can fight too," she took a deep breath, "let go of me."

"No, you are far more important than they are, you can't—" 

"Let go!" Her magic burst forth, chilling the air and shaking off the other's grasp, then she strode forward without looking back. Seeing the enemy's fierce masks and blood-dripping weapons no more than a hundred steps away, she felt her heart gradually tightening. But even so, she was unwilling to continue hiding behind others—as a Holy City witch, even if she were to die, she should die on the battlefield!

"Make way!"

Just then, a clear reprimand came from one side of the battlefield, and a figure descended from the sky, like a deity arriving.



She stood with her back to everyone, raising the long sword in her hand high. Her reddish-brown hair, like flames, ignited hope in everyone's hearts in an instant.

"The warriors blessed by the Union!"

"She is... beyond extraordinary!"

Amidst the people's exclamations, radiance began to flow between the blade, quickly turning the sword into a dazzling golden color—like a newly born sun, beams of light spilled across the land, and even the dark red clouds in the sky dared not obscure its sharpness, reflecting countless golden tassels beneath the clouds. As the light reached its peak, the figure leaped forward and swung her long sword down at the incoming devil.

Complete silence.

In that instant, time seemed to come to a halt, and before the incandescent light that devoured everything arrived, the figure of the enemy was like the last trace of darkness at dawn.

Be it a frenzied demon or a hell lord, they all collapsed thunderously in this brightness.

When she opened her eyes again, the snowy ground before her had turned into a scorched earth, and the approaching enemy was as if it had never existed.

Seeing this scene, the other devils simultaneously retreated, and more warriors blessed by the Union arrived, joining the battlefield to pursue the fleeing enemy, breaking the encirclement.



"Quick, get out of here," the sword-wielding witch gasped as if she had exhausted all her strength, kneeling on one knee, "Take the chance and leave now."



"But... my lady, where can we go?" someone in the crowd asked.



Indeed, where could they go? She thought bitterly. Even the last Holy City had fallen to the demons' onslaught, tens of thousands had perished, and despite exhausting all means, they could not turn the tide of defeat.



"Do not give up; we still have hope!" the red-haired witch declared resolutely. "Cross the great mountains, traverse the rivers, and head for the barbaric lands."



"But... there are only some backward rural peasants there."



"We can rebuild order. Go, as long as we survive, we will surely see the day of victory!"



...



"Master, why don't you go with them?"



She led a line of people away from the crowd, hurrying westward. Apart from Kav and the family guards, the rest had almost no fighting capability; they were all servants and maids from the Tower.



"I left some key magic stones and documents in the trial tower within the Misty Forest. Since we need to rebuild order, these items are crucial for witches. I plan to take them across the mountain," she said.

"The devils are catching up!"

"Hammerstone, go and hold them off," Karl ordered.

"Yes!"

She clenched her teeth and bowed her head as she moved forward. These mortals could only impede the devils' pace and were totally unable to defeat them. This time, there might be no chance of survival. But she had to leave them behind and hurry to her destination.

For some reason, black and white spots began to appear in the sky... Her vision grew blurry.

...

Karl was panting heavily as he followed behind her. Even someone as robust as him was extremely tired after trekking through the snow for three days.

She glanced back; their group of more than thirty people was now down to just six. Some had fled midway, and others had left the group due to severe injuries. If the devils caught up to them again...



"Rest assured, Master, I am still here," Carter said, as if he had seen through her thoughts, comforting her, "I will do my utmost to hold them back."

"Why?"

He was slightly taken aback.

"Why do you insist on staying to the end? If you flee now, you might still survive," she said, puzzled, "We are witches, always high above, while you are just a common man. Under normal circumstances, you wouldn't think of dying alongside me."

"But you have never mistreated us, and although I do not possess magical power, I understand many principles—protecting you is my duty."

A commotion arose from behind, everyone understood that the final moment had come.

"Master, go quickly, do not look back."

The black and white spots were becoming more numerous.

...



She stumbled into the basement, tidying up the documents and magic stones on the table.

Kaf's words had left her somewhat perplexed.

For a long time, it had been a prevalent belief within the Holy City that witches were chosen by the divine. Those incapable of condensing magic power were considered ignorant and incompetent, merely the soil to cultivate them. However, in this family guard captain, she saw courage and resilience, not the incapability spoken of by everyone. In fact, they possessed qualities that witches did not, and cooperation between the two was far better than one-sided exploitation—at least, that was the case in her stone tower.

If so, why had the people over four hundred years ago been utterly defeated?

Suddenly, the roar of devils sounded outside the door.

Damn it, they had come so quickly.

Her vision was already blurred, with numerous spots dancing before her eyes, almost filling her entire field of view... But she could not die here; she had to take all her research findings with her—over the mountains, across the rivers, to that wild land to rebuild order!

She took out a resonance magic stone, infused it with magic power, and made it continuously emit a distress signal.

The wooden door burst apart with a loud bang, and the devils had broken in.



Hoping someone would hear her plea for help, she channeled all her magic power, turning it into frost that burst forth. The demonic beast raised its spear, its arm swelling rapidly. In the next moment, the spear tip, emitting a cold light, flew straight towards her.



Involuntarily, she closed her eyes, black and white spots suddenly obscuring everything. Her vision turned pitch black, and all sounds disappeared. She no longer felt the cold; it was as if she was wrapped in a bundle of soft velvet, as though she wasn't in a dark basement but lying on a warm meadow instead. The pain that should have come from being pierced through did not arrive for a long time.



Am I dead?



After what seemed like an eternity, a sliver of light appeared in the darkness, growing brighter and brighter. She attempted to slowly open her eyes, and the blurry grey ceiling gradually came into view.



She heard someone say, "Your Highness, she's awake."
