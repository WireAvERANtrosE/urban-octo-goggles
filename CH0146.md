## Trace the Shadows (Part 2)
Theo regained consciousness with a throbbing pain at the back of his neck.

Damn, these women were really ruthless. He opened his eyes and tried to move, only to find his hands tightly bound behind his back and his legs tied apart to the legs of two chairs.

"He's awake," a woman's voice sounded by his ear.

"What's your name?" one person walked in front of him and lifted his chin, "I suggest you don't lie, otherwise, you'll become a floating corpse in the moat by tomorrow."

Theo blinked, the woman in front of him wore a veil on her head and was shrouded in a long robe, clearly not wanting her appearance to be seen.

"Theo," he responded truthfully, while quietly surveying his surroundings.

It was a narrow room, surrounded by dusty plaster statues, some complete and some obviously only half carved. The accumulated dust had dyed the plaster a grayish-brown color, as if the place had been abandoned for a long time. There were no windows in the room, no way to see the sky or guess the time; the only source of light came from an oil lamp on the wall.

"From Dragon Cliffs City to Silver City, so tirelessly," the woman said coldly, "what do you want with us?"

"It's not me looking for you, it's the Mutual Aid Society that's looking for you."



"What is the Mutual Aid Society?"

"It's a witch organization just like yours. I was entrusted by them to spread the message."

"Nonsense," she said sharply. "I don't know where you heard this name from, but the Mutual Aid Society is far away in the Seawind Shire of the Eastern Region. Do you think that by simply using a name, we would believe it to be true?" The woman pulled out a dagger from her waist—Theo realized that it was the one he had used before, "I'll give you one last chance, do not test my patience!"

"Everything I've said is true!" He spoke in a suppressed voice, as if he wanted to shout but didn't dare to raise his voice, "They originally planned to go to the Impassable Mountain Range to search for the Holy Mountain, but now they have not only found the Holy Mountain but also settled down in Border Town, and the symptoms of the demonic plague have disappeared. Therefore, they want to rescue more witches. I swear I'm not lying!"

"Why would they seek you out?"

"Because I've helped them before. When a member of the Mutual Aid Society was being pursued and blocked by the Church's Judgement Army, I helped her divert the pursuers. Their mentor is called Cara, and there's Wendy and Scroll, they are the ones who asked me to come!"

After listening, the masked woman fell silent for a moment, then sheathed her dagger at her waist and moved behind him. Soon, Theo heard whispering behind him.

Chick, he thought to himself, these two are good at underhanded tactics, but they are complete novices at interrogation.

The biggest taboo in interrogation is to only give one chance to choose. If no answers are obtained, it's easy to drive the interrogator into a corner—should they kill or not? If they kill, then they lose the chance of obtaining information; if they don't, it's equivalent to failing to carry out the threat they've made. This can severely damage the interrogator's authority, and the effectiveness of their threats will significantly decrease the next time.



If it were him conducting the interrogation, he would surely start with the fingers—every time a lie was told, one finger would be cut off. Even if there were a misjudgment, it wouldn't be a big issue. The promise of certain action would rapidly collapse the enemy's morale, and those without professional training would find it difficult to withstand such questioning.



Feigning utter terror, he spilt the beans, leaving the other party somewhat skeptical, while simultaneously revealing that they truly lacked the ability to discern whether he was lying.



And the information about Cara, the Holy Mountain, and the Witch Cooperation Association was all true and reliable, which would further strengthen the persuasiveness of his own intelligence.



It wasn't long before the masked woman appeared before him again, "When did they arrive in the Western Region?"



"About two or three months before the Evil Months, after winter ended, they returned to the town and declared that they had found the Holy Mountain."



"How many of them are there?"



"About forty? I'm not too clear on that, aside from Cara, the other witches rarely make an appearance," Theo decided to add another chip to the stakes, "The Serpent Witch Cara, have you heard of her? Her power is to summon serpents of magic, one of which is called 'Void', which can quickly neutralize any poison. I've seen it with my own eyes; it's quite miraculous."



"You're not afraid of witches?" The woman's tone was somewhat puzzled.



"Why should I be afraid? The witches from the Witch Cooperation Association are all very... beautiful, and they're not like ferocious beasts baring fangs and claws. They haven't harmed ordinary people either. If I were afraid, I wouldn't have traveled such a long distance to help them spread their message."



"If someone goes to Border Town, how would they contact them?"

"Some of them can sense magic; witches will naturally be found by them once they arrive there."

"Nightfall, what do you think?" the masked woman looked up towards the person behind her.

"I don't know," hesitated the witch known as Nightfall, "how about we wait for Sister to come back before making a decision? She will surely know what to do."

"...Alright." She nodded, found a relatively clean chair, and sat down in front of Theo.

"Who is Sister?"

"Guide," the masked woman's attitude had softened a lot compared to before, probably because the statement of not fearing witches made a deep impression on her, "she will lead us out of here."

"Leave, to where?"

The other party shook her head, without answering.



"You are not a witch from Silver City, are you?" Theo continued to ask, "Your accent doesn't sound like someone from the capital. Silver City is very close to the capital, so the residents here take pride in imitating the capital's accent."

She hesitated for a moment, "I... come from the Southern Territory."



Witches from all over the kingdom gathered here, and soon they would be led away by guides... Theo thought to himself, without doubt, this was another witch organization. They were recruiting companions, just like the Mutual Aid Society had done before. But where exactly did they plan to go?



Just then, footsteps sounded from outside the room.

"Sister is back!" Shadow cheered, and as the wooden door creaked open, Theo also held his breath.



"Is he the one who has been using the underground channels to spread the news?" The newcomer's voice was mature and steady, "Did you find out anything?"

"It all seems to be true," the masked woman repeated the questions and her own opinions, "He couldn't have known so clearly without having had profound contact with the Mutual Aid Society."



"Hmm, that is true," she said, sweeping past Theo to stand in front of him. Unlike the masked woman, her face was uncovered, with long black hair that nearly reached her waist, and she appeared to be about twenty-five or twenty-six years old. The most striking feature were her eyes—Theo noticed that the outer ring of her pupils was golden, and even standing against the light, one could clearly see her star-like eyes.



Theo considered himself to have seen many witches while at the prince's side, but the appearance of this woman still ranked among the very top. She had a scar that ran through her eyebrow bone down to her cheek on her left eye. Far from diminishing her beauty, the scar added a sense of sternness to her. From the first glance, Theo felt that this woman was a true warrior.



"If the Witch Cooperation Association really found the Holy Mountain, they shouldn't be spreading such news," she shook her head. "This will only lead the church straight to them. If they do not leave Border Town soon, they may face great disaster."

"What should we do then?" Nightingale asked.

"The ship will arrive at midnight today, and there are other witches on it, so you must leave," she said without hesitation. "I will escort you onto the ship. As for the Witch Cooperation Association..." The black-haired woman glanced at Theo tied up in the chair, "Please send my regards to Tilly for me, tell her I will be arriving later than expected, and I might even bring her more companions."

"Are you going with him to Border Town?" Nightingale asked in surprise. "But, what if this is all a trap..."

"Then he would only be harming himself," she said with a slight smile, her words brimming with confidence.
