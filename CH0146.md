## Tracking Shadows (Part 2)
When Tassa regained consciousness, a sharp pain shot through the back of his neck.

Damn, these women were really vicious. He opened his eyes and tried to move, only to find his hands tied firmly behind his back and his legs bound to the legs of two chairs.

"He's awake," came a woman's voice by his ear.

"What is your name?" a person stepped in front of him and lifted his chin, "I suggest you don't lie, or you'll become a floating corpse in the moat by tomorrow."

Tassa blinked, the woman in front of him wore a veil on her head and was shrouded in a robe, clearly not wanting her face to be seen by him.

"Tassa," he replied truthfully while quietly observing his surroundings.

This was a narrow room, surrounded by dusty plaster statues, some complete, some obviously only half-carved. The accumulated dust had dyed the plaster a grayish brown, as if the place had been abandoned for a long time. There were no windows in the room, making it impossible to see the sky or guess the time. The only source of light came from an oil lamp on the wall.

"From Dragonridge Mountain to Silver City, you are so persistent," the woman said coldly, "what do you want with us?"

"It's not me who is looking for you, but the Mutual Aid Society."



"What is the Mutual Aid Society?"

"It's an organization of witches like you. I have been entrusted by them to spread the message."

"Nonsense," she said sharply. "I don't know where you heard that name from, but the Mutual Aid Society is far away in the Sea Breeze County of the Eastern Region. Do you think we will believe it's true just because you randomly use a name?" The woman pulled out a dagger from her waist—it was indeed the one Tassa had used before—"I'm giving you one last chance, do not test my patience!"

"Everything I've said is true!" he said in a suppressed voice, as if he wanted to shout but didn't dare to raise his voice. "They originally planned to go to the Impassable Mountain Range to search for the Holy Mountain, and now not only have they found the Holy Mountain, but they have also settled down in Border Town. The symptoms of the demonic bite have disappeared, so they want to save more witches. I swear I am not lying!"

"Why did they seek you out?"

"Because I helped them. When a member of the Mutual Aid Society was being chased by the Church's Judgement Army, I helped her divert the pursuers. Their mentor is called Cara, and there are Wendy and Scroll; they are the ones who asked me to come!"

After listening, the masked woman was silent for a moment, then she sheathed her dagger and moved behind him. Soon, Tassa heard the murmurs of two people behind him.

Fledglings, he assessed internally. These two were quite precise in their underhanded methods, but their interrogation skills were completely novice.

The worst thing in an interrogation is to only give one chance to choose. If the answer is not extracted, it's easy to push the interrogator into a corner—kill or not kill? If you kill, you lose the possibility of getting information. If you do not kill, it's equivalent to failing to carry out the threat you've made. This can severely damage the interrogator's authority, and the power of their threats will greatly diminish next time.



If it were him conducting the interrogation, he would definitely start with the fingers—each lie told would result in the severing of one finger. Even if a mistake in judgment occurred, it wasn't a big deal. The threat of following through would quickly break the enemy's spirit; those not professionally trained would find it difficult to withstand such interrogation.

By pretending to be terrified and spilling everything, he would make the other party dubious while also revealing that they had no real ability to discern whether he was lying.

The information about Cara, Holy Mountain, and the Mutual Aid Society was all true and reliable, which would further strengthen the credibility of his intelligence.

Soon, the masked woman appeared before him again. "When did they arrive in the Western Region?"

"A couple of months before the Evil Months, right after winter ended, they returned to the town and claimed to have found the Holy Mountain."

"How many of them are there?"

"About forty? I'm not too sure myself, the other witches hardly ever show up besides Cara," Tassa decided to add a bit more to the stakes, "The Serpent Witch Cara, have you heard of her? Her power is to summon magic serpents, one of which is called 'Void', capable of quickly neutralizing any toxin. I've seen it with my own eyes, quite miraculous."

"You're not afraid of witches?" The woman's tone was somewhat puzzled.

"Why should I be afraid? The witches from the Mutual Aid Society are all very... beautiful, not like ferocious beasts baring their teeth and claws. They haven't hurt ordinary people either. If I were afraid, I wouldn't have traveled such a long distance to help them spread the word."



"If someone goes to Border Town, how can they contact them?"

"Some of them can sense magic, witches will naturally be found by them once they get there."

"Shadow, what do you think?" the masked woman looked up towards the person behind her.

"I don't know," the witch known as Shadow hesitated, "Let's wait for sister to come back and decide then, she will surely know what to do."

"…Alright." She nodded and found a relatively clean chair to sit in front of Tassa.

"Who is sister?"

"Guide," the masked woman's demeanor had softened a lot compared to before, probably because the statement about not fearing witches had moved her, "She will lead us away from here."

"Leave, to where?"

The other party shook her head, not answering.



"You're not a witch from Silver City, are you?" Tassa continued to ask, "Your accent doesn't sound like someone from the capital. Silver City is very close to the capital, so the residents here take pride in imitating the capital's accent."

She hesitated for a moment, "I... come from the southern border."



Witches from all over the kingdom gathered here, soon to be led away by the guides... Tassa thought to herself, without a doubt, this was another witch organization. They were recruiting companions, just like the Mutual Aid Society had done before. But where exactly did they plan to go?



Just then, footsteps sounded from outside the house.

"Sister is back!" Shadow cheered, and as the wooden door creaked open, Tassa held her breath.

"Is he the one who has been spreading messages through the underground channels?" The newcomer's voice was mature and steady, "Did you find out anything?"

"It seems that everything he said is true." The masked woman recounted the questions asked and her own opinions, "He couldn't have known so much if he hadn't had extensive contact with the Mutual Aid Society."

"Hmm, that makes sense." She moved past Tassa and stood in front of him. Unlike the masked woman, her face was uncovered, with long black hair reaching nearly to her waist, and she appeared to be around twenty-five or twenty-six years old. What was most striking were her eyes—Tassa noticed that the outer ring of her pupils was golden, clearly visible like stars even from the backlight.

Tassa considered herself to have seen many witches by the prince's side, but this woman's appearance still ranked among the very best. There was a scar across her left eyebrow bone, extending down to her cheek. Far from marring her beauty, the scar added a sense of solemnity to her. From the first glance, Tassa felt that this woman was a true warrior.



"If the Mutual Aid Society really found the Holy Mountain, they shouldn't have sent someone to spread such news," she shook her head. "This will only lead the Church to come sniffing around. If they don't leave Border Town soon, they might be in big trouble."

"What should we do then?" Nightingale asked.

"The ship will arrive at midnight today, and there are other witches on board, so you must leave," she said without hesitation. "I will escort you onto the ship. As for the Mutual Aid Society..." The black-haired woman glanced at Tassa tied to the chair, "Please help me send a message to Tilly, tell her I will be a few days late, and I might bring her more companions."

"You're going with him to Border Town?" Nightingale said in surprise. "But what if this is a trap..."

"If it is a trap, he will only be killing himself," she said with a slight smile, her words filled with confidence.
