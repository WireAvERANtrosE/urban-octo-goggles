## Return to the Fortress
Roland considered the effects of the pills and did not immediately order the First Army to pursue. Instead, he sent Lightning and Maggie to monitor the situation of the enemy.



The wounded on the defense line were immediately attended to. Throughout the battle, only five people were injured, all by thrown spears, with four of them from the artillery team. To his relief, the enemy's spear throw, which closed in to about one hundred and fifty meters, did not scatter the gunners. Instead, they ducked down, took cover behind the gun carriages, and re-engaged in the fight in the shortest time possible.



Nana stayed on standby behind the defense line, especially when the enemy turned and fled. Ignoring the rumbling cannon fire, she ran to the artillery position with Viscount Titus to treat those wounded by the spears. It was hard to imagine that just half a year ago, she was a young girl who would feel dizzy at the sight of blood.



In the end, all five of them survived. Amidst the cheering, many soldiers saluted her as they watched her leave the battlefield.



In fact, this battle was much easier than dealing with the Duke's allied forces. Without the drugs, the addicted militia performed extremely poorly, with some even lying down on the ground after running out two or three kilometers, unwilling to move any further.



The pursuing troops quickly rounded them all up and escorted them to Longsong Stronghold. During this period, the First Army also captured two knights. Although they had not taken the pills, they had lost the will to resist. Faced with the approaching pursuers, they simply chose to surrender and requested to write to their families for a chance of ransom.



They arrived at Longsong Stronghold four days later.



Based on the intelligence from the interrogated surrendering knights, Nightingale easily dismantled the troops left behind to guard the stronghold castle. The captain was killed on the spot, and more than a hundred militiamen dispersed in panic, then fell into an ambush set by the First Army at the main gate.



Roland's subordinates found the imprisoned Petrov in the dungeon of the castle. He looked somewhat haggard, probably due to worry and anxiety, but considering the noble status of Earl Honeysuckle, he had not suffered any inhumane treatment.



After nearly three months, the prince saw the agent again.



"Your Highness, it's so good to see you," Petro relaxed his anxious heart as he recounted in detail what had happened these days, "I don't know about Timothy's envoys..."



"They're all dead," Roland leaned back in his chair and said indifferently, "Additionally, of the one thousand five hundred people they brought, the majority died at the outskirts of the town, the rest are currently locked up in the fortress prison."



Petro seemed somewhat surprised when he heard that the entire envoy was annihilated, "Your Highness, if you do this, I fear the new king... no, your brother will see you as a thorn in his side."



"So I should just surrender without a fight, obediently return to the capital, and let him manipulate me?" Roland's eyes stared straight at him.



The latter involuntarily lowered his head, "No, Your Highness..."



"From the moment he sent troops to step into the Western Territory, he has been my enemy," the prince said calmly, "Timothy Wimbledon, in his quest for power, will only act more urgently. He is in dire need of land and titles to distribute to those nobles who support him. If it were just for pleasure, why would you manage this fortress on my behalf? You should be well aware that only when I become the King of Greycastle will your position in the Western Territory be as solid as a rock." He paused for a moment and then continued, "To prevent this kind of situation from happening again, I need to form an army to defend the fortress."



"An army?" Petro was taken aback.



"That's right, not knights, but an army composed of civilians dedicated to combat," Roland slowly revealed his plan, "You will select a team of three hundred people from the fortress, to be trained by my subordinates in combat. The requirements for these three hundred are: they must be civilians, have not committed crimes, are not followers of the Church, between the ages of sixteen and thirty, and without any disabilities. During training, they will reside in Border Town, and I will provide the weapons. Your knights and patrol teams will henceforth only be responsible for the city's security. More details are written here," he handed the other party a piece of parchment, "You can issue notices and carry out recruitment and screening according to the content on it."



To take control of the city's defenses, it is clearly most appropriate to station one's own troops. However, the First Army has too few soldiers, barely enough to defend Border Town, let alone dispatch troops to garrison Longsong Stronghold. Therefore, having the other party provide manpower for training is a compromise.



Nightingale's lie detection ability can ensure the purity of the troops, and the new military training methods and ideological education will allow these people to quickly form combat effectiveness. The weapons to be equipped are the soon-to-be-phased-out flintlock muskets, which would not be a big problem even if captured by the enemy. In addition, this army can also undertake the tasks of information and intelligence transmission. As long as someone attempts to attack the stronghold, Roland would be able to receive the news immediately.



"I understand," Petro nodded.



"The personnel you've selected, I will review them. Do not try to plant spies within the ranks, it's meaningless," Roland warned. "Those spies you sent before are now working in the mines. If something similar happens againâ€¦"



"No, Your Highness," the other party wiped the sweat from his forehead, "I assure you it won't happen again."



"Next is the Church," the prince leaned back in his chair with satisfaction, "You probably don't know yet, the Grand Cathedral in the stronghold was set on fire by Timothy's men, and Archbishop Tael has been killed by them. Now, there is only ruins left."



"They actually burned down the cathedral?" Petro was stunned by the news, "This... I must report this to Hermes."



According to the Church's laws, kings and lords are obligated to protect local church facilities from harm, and if unable to prevent it, they must immediately report the news to the Holy City. For Mr. Petro, a former ambassador well-versed in the laws, this is a normal reaction. Moreover, such an event cannot be concealed. It is likely that devout believers in the stronghold had already sent secret messages to the Holy City on the day of the incident.



"It is indeed necessary to report, but the content of the letter needs to be adjusted," Roland curled his lips, "You just need to state in the letter that the attackers were Timothy Wimbledon's troops, who left Longsong Stronghold shortly after looting and burning the cathedral, with their whereabouts unknown. Also, include this with the letter," he took out a pill from his pocket and handed it to Petro, "just say it was found near the cathedral, they will understand."



"What is... this?"

"The church's secret medicine, and also Timothy's target. It can make ordinary people burst out with extraordinary strength in a short period of time, but after the effects of the medicine wear off, the user will gradually weaken and die," Roland explained simply, "Timothy wants to use this drug to strengthen the army and secure his precarious throne. The church, seeing this pill, will naturally understand his intentions."

As for whether they will take any measures, that's another matter.

"Understood, Your Highness," Peiro responded, tucking the pill into his chest.
