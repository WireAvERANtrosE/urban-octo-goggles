## Return to the Fortress
Considering the effects of the pills, Roland did not immediately order the First Army to pursue the enemy. Instead, he sent Lightning and Maggie to monitor the situation.



The wounded on the defense line were immediately treated. Throughout the battle, only five were injured, all by thrown spears, and four of them were from the artillery squad. To his relief, the enemy's spear throw, when they approached within about 150 meters, did not scatter the artillerymen. Instead, they ducked down, using the gun carriages to avoid the short spears, and re-engaged in combat in the shortest time possible.



Nana remained on standby behind the defense line, especially when the enemy turned tail and ran. Ignoring the booming of the cannons, she ran towards the artillery position with Viscount Titus, treating those who had been stabbed by the short spears. It was hard to imagine that just half a year ago, she was a young girl who would feel dizzy at the sight of blood.



In the end, all five of them survived. Amidst the cheers, many soldiers saluted her as they watched her leave the battlefield.



In fact, this battle was much easier than dealing with the Duke's Allied Army. Without the drugs, the addicted militia were incredibly incompetent; some even lay down on the ground after running two or three kilometers and refused to move any further.



The pursuing troops quickly gathered them all up and escorted them to Longsong Stronghold. During this time, the First Army also captured two knights. Although they had not taken the pills, they had lost the will to resist. Faced with the continuously closing pursuers, they simply chose to surrender and requested to write letters to their families for a chance of redemption.



They arrived at Longsong Stronghold four days later.



Based on the intelligence gathered from the interrogated surrendered knights, Nightingale easily dissolved the troops left behind in the stronghold's castle. The captain was killed on the spot, and over a hundred militiamen scattered in panic, only to fall into the ambush set by the First Army at the main gate.



Roland's men found Peter imprisoned in the castle's dungeon. He appeared somewhat haggard, probably due to worry and anxiety. However, considering the noble status of Earl Honeysuckle, he had not been subjected to inhumane treatment.



Nearly three months had passed since the prince last saw this agent.

"Your Highness, it's truly wonderful to see you," Peter's anxious heart finally relaxed as he recounted everything he had experienced these days, "I don't know about the envoys of Timothy..."

"They're all dead," Roland leaned back in his chair and said carelessly, "Additionally, the fifteen hundred men they brought have mostly died at the borders of the town, and the rest are currently locked up in the stronghold's prison."

Peter seemed somewhat surprised to hear that the entire envoy was annihilated, "Your Highness, doing so, I'm afraid the new king... no, your brother will see you as a thorn in his side."

"So I should just surrender without a fight, obediently return to the capital, and let him manipulate me as he pleases?" Roland's eyes stared straight at the other.

Involuntarily, the latter lowered his head, "No, Your Highness..."

"From the moment he sent troops into the Western Territory, he was already my enemy," the prince said calmly, "Timothy Wimbledon, in his quest for power, will only become more and more urgent. He needs land and titles to distribute to the nobles who support him. If it was just for pleasure, why would you manage this stronghold for me? You should be well aware that only when I become the King of Greycastle can your status in the Western Territory be as solid as a mountain." He paused for a moment and then continued, "To prevent this kind of situation from happening again, I need to form an army to defend the stronghold."

"An army?" Peter was taken aback.

"That's right, not knights, but an army composed of civilians, dedicated to fighting," Roland slowly revealed his plan, "You will pick a team of three hundred people from the stronghold, and my subordinates will train them in combat. The requirements for these three hundred are: they must be civilians, without any criminal record, not followers of the Church, aged between sixteen and thirty, and physically able-bodied. During the training period, they will reside in Border Town, and I will provide the weapons. Your knights and patrol teams will henceforth only be responsible for the city's security, and more details are written here," he handed over a piece of parchment, "You can issue a notice according to the contents here, to recruit and select."



To keep the city defense under his own control, it was clearly most suitable to station an army of his own. However, the First Army was too small in number and was barely sufficient to defend Border Town, let alone to dispatch troops to garrison Longsong Stronghold. Therefore, having the other party provide personnel for him to train was a compromise.

Nightingale's lie detection ability could ensure the purity of the troops, and the new military training methods and ideological education would allow these people to quickly form combat effectiveness. Equipping them with weapons that were the soon-to-be-obsolete muzzle-loading flintlocks would not be a big issue even if they were captured by the enemy. In addition, this army could also undertake the task of transmitting information and intelligence. As long as someone attempted to attack the stronghold, Roland would receive the news at the first moment.



"I understand," Peter nodded.



"The people you've screened, I will review them. Don't try to insert spies into the troop; it's meaningless," Roland warned. "Those spies you sent before are now in the mines. If something similar happens again..."



"No, Your Highness," the other party wiped the sweat from his forehead, "I assure you it won't happen again."



"Next is the Church," the prince leaned back in his chair with satisfaction, "You probably don't know yet, but the stronghold's cathedral was set on fire by Timothy's subordinates, and Archbishop Thylo was killed by them. Now there's nothing but ruins left there."



"They actually burned down the cathedral?" Peter was stunned by the news, "This... I must report this to Hermes."



According to Church laws, kings and lords are obligated to protect local church facilities from harm, and if they are powerless to prevent it, they must immediately report the news to the Holy City. For the former ambassador who was well-versed in laws, this was a normal response, and such things could not be concealed. It was likely that the devout believers within the stronghold had already sent a secret letter to the Holy City on the day of the incident.



"It is indeed necessary to report, but the content of the letter needs to be adjusted appropriately," Roland curled his lips, "You just need to state in the letter that the attackers were troops of Timothy Wimbledon, and that they left Longsong Stronghold shortly after looting and burning the cathedral, with no known destination. Also, include this with the letter," he took out a pill from his pocket and handed it to Peter, "just say it was something found near the cathedral, they will naturally understand."



"This is... what?"



"It's the Church's elixir, and also Timothy's target. It can grant ordinary people extraordinary strength in a short amount of time, but after the effects wear off, the user will gradually weaken and die," Roland explained briefly. "Timothy wanted to rely on this drug to strengthen his army and secure his precarious throne. The Church, upon seeing this pill, will naturally understand his intentions."



Whether they would take any measures was another matter.



"As you command, Your Highness," Peter responded as he tucked the pill into his bosom.
