## Winterfell
Roland stood atop the city wall, gazing toward the North. Over the past month, he had been repeating a cycle between the castle, the mining area, and the city wall, checking every detail that might have been overlooked.



The militia's spearing movements were becoming more proficient. Under Carter's repeated drills, they had learned to steady their spears until the observing hunters shouted the attack signal, then they would thrust their long spears forward.



Standing behind them was the team of hunters. All the hunters who stayed in Border Town and were skilled with bows and crossbows had been incorporated into this team. These experienced hunters, the main force in killing demonic beasts, shot from atop the twelve-foot-high city wall with almost no chance of missing.



Lastly, there was the finishing team, comprised of Iron Axe, Carter, and two other elite hunters. The four muzzle-loading flintlock muskets, forged by the blacksmiths and assembled by Anna, had been delivered for use. They were only called upon by the finishing team to kill troublesome monsters or mixed demonic beasts whose hides were impervious to bows and crossbows. Their position was very flexible; they roamed along the roughly two-hundred-meter stretch of the wall, appearing wherever they were needed.



As for the explosive packages, they were stored in a closely guarded warehouse beneath the city wall. They were only brought up to the wall when needed to save the day—after all, should anything go wrong with them, the damage they could cause would potentially be greater than that of the demonic beasts. The beasts' teeth could not damage the cement rubble masonry, but explosives could send an entire segment of the wall sky-high.



So far, Roland had organized two live drills, including the use of explosive packages. Thanks to these drills, the embarrassment of the militia being frightened by the thunderous roar of the explosives and throwing away their weapons during the actual defense battle was avoided. Another benefit was that when everyone realized that the prince had such a powerful weapon in his hands, the morale of the troops immediately soared.



"Your Highness," Barov tightened his collar, "most of the income from the ore trade has been spent. If the Evil Months are as long as the astrologers have said, I estimate that we won't last until the end of winter."



"Then pour everything from my treasury into it," Roland said without hesitation. "Also, don't stop trading with Willow Town. The Steam Engine No. 1 has been transported to the mine, and the clearing of the collapsed rubble is almost complete. We can still get some output over the winter. Especially the raw gemstones, don't emphasize the price anymore, sell them as quickly as possible. It's always right to store more food and jerky."



Barov nodded, "I'll take care of it, Your Highness. It's just..."



Seeing the hesitant look on the minister assistant's face, Roland naturally understood what he wanted to say, "Rest assured, I have arranged for a small boat. If the situation truly becomes a complete rout, I will leave the town."

"Then I can rest easy," Barov sighed in relief.

Roland smiled at him, "Go attend to your duties, I'll stay here a little longer by myself."

After Barov left, the prince slowly ascended the watchtower. This was the highest point in the center of the city wall, from where he could overlook the vast forest ahead and the rolling mountains beyond. The cold wind howled against his face, but he was indifferent to it. It was only on this open high platform that the tension he felt facing the great battle would calm down.

"You're lying to him," someone said beside him, "You have no intention of leaving at all."

"Life is already so difficult, some things are better left unsaid."

"I don't understand what you are rambling about. If even the identity of a prince is considered difficult, what does that make us?" Nightingale revealed herself, "Even if you can't become the king, as long as you survive the five-year contest, you'll still be a lord of a domain. Instead of worrying about this, you'd better spend more time with Anna. I fear... she doesn't have much time left."

Roland fell silent for a moment, "I don't think she won't live through the Evil Months."

"Why?"



"She said she won't lose to a demonic bite," he paused, "I believe her."

"You actually believe a witch," Nightingale shook her head, "We are people cursed by devils."

"Is that so? I believe in you as well."

"......"

......

Brian, dressed in casual clothing, stood in front of Grayhound's tombstone.

He gently touched the brand-new stele, the pure white surface was engraved with a line of text: "Nameless, but forever in our hearts. A hero who sacrificed for Border Town."

"Grayhound."

"I have realized my dream; after the Evil Months are over, His Highness, the Fourth Prince, will hold an knighting ceremony for me."



"But I do not want to sit on a bed waiting."

"My wounds have already healed, and it is on the city walls where I belong."

"The Evil Months are fast approaching, the demonic beasts may be terrifying, but they will crash headlong into the defense line that we have all worked together to build, unable to advance a single step further."

"I will wield my longsword for the both of us, to defend this town."

"This is not the end."

"The person who framed you is still alive... but he will not live for long, this is the prince's promise to me."

"The next time we meet, I will bring good news."

Brian bent down and placed a bouquet of flowers in front of the gravestone.

"Until then, farewell, my friend."



"Anna, aren't you scared?" Nana asked, lying on the bed with her legs bent.

"Scared of what?"

"The demonic bite. Nightingale said it happens in winter, right? I only became a witch in the fall, this year is my first time..."

"The first time, huh," Anna pondered, "It will be very painful, sometimes you may even wish to die immediately."

"Ah!" Nana exclaimed in shock before quickly covering her mouth.

"But you will survive, just like I did."

"I don't know..." Nana spoke softly, "I'm not as strong as you."

"I'm not that strong either," Anna closed her eyes, recalling the first time she met Roland. In that dim and chilly dungeon, he had draped his clothes over her, softly saying he wanted to employ her—until now, she still found it unbelievable, "You'll also encounter things that make you want to keep living, even if it means struggling to survive."



"For example...?"

"For example, a steak covered in sauce," she sighed. "How would I know what you want—hmm?"

Staring intently at her, Nana, Anna wiped her face with her hand. "Is there something dirty on my face?"

"No..." the latter shook her head, "I'm just a bit surprised, you've never talked so much with me before... Sister Anna, you looked so beautiful just now when you closed your eyes in thought."

Anna rolled her eyes, jumped off the bed, and walked to the window.

Nana followed her, "What are you looking at, the Misty Forest?"

"The forest is to the west," Anna replied irritably, "From here you can only see the Redwater River."

"Sister Anna, look!" the girl pointed to the sky.

Anna paused, then pushed open the window, and a cold wind mixed with a few snowflakes rushed into the room.



She stretched out her hand and pinched the crystal-clear snowflake, feeling a chill pass between her fingers.

"It's snowing."

...

...

After a long silence, Nightingale finally spoke, "You actually didn't lie."

"Of course," Roland laughed, "I rarely tell lies."

Nightingale didn't say anything more; she turned her head away, her eyes filled with an indiscernible expression.

Suddenly, she felt a chill on her neck and involuntarily shrank it. Looking up, she realized that, unbeknownst to her, snowflakes had started to drift down from above the city walls. The gray sky seemed to have been filled with countless white sprites, dancing on the north wind, fluttering everywhere along with the chanting of the militia's training.

...

The Evil Months had begun.
