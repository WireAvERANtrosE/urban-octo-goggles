## Wintering
Roland stood on the city wall, gazing towards the north. Over the past month, he had been repeating the cycle between the castle, the mining area, and the city wall, checking every detail that might have been overlooked. 



The militia's thrusting movements were becoming more proficient. Under Carter's repeated drills, they could now steady their spears until the hunters in charge of observation shouted the attack slogan, then they would thrust their long spears. 



Standing behind them was the Hunter's Team. All the hunters in Border Town who were good at using bows and crossbows had been incorporated into this group. These experienced hunters were the main force against the demonic beasts. Shooting from the twelve-foot-high city wall, they had little chance of missing.



Lastly, there was the Execution Team, composed of Iron Axe, Carter and two other elite hunters. The four flintlock rifles, made by the blacksmith shop and assembled by Anna, had been put into use. They only took action when encountering tricky monsters or hybrid demonic beasts that could not be penetrated by bows and crossbows. Their position was quite flexible, moving around the approximately two hundred meters long area, appearing wherever needed.



As for the explosives, they were stored in a tightly guarded warehouse under the city wall. They would only be transported up to the city wall individually when there was an emergency. After all, these things could cause more damage than the demonic beasts if mishandled. The teeth of the demonic beasts couldn't damage the concrete rubble, but the explosives could blow up the entire city wall.



So far, Roland had organized two live drills, including the use of explosives. Thanks to these drills, they had avoided the embarrassment of the militia dropping their weapons in fright due to the loud noises of the explosives during the actual defense battles. Another advantage was that when everyone found out that the prince had such a powerful weapon, the morale of the team instantly soared.



"Your Highness," Barov tightened his collar, "most of the income from the ore trade has been spent. If the Evil Months are as long as the astrologers say, I'm afraid we won't make it through the winter."



"Just empty my treasury," Roland said without hesitation, "and don't stop the trade with Willow Town. The first steam engine has been transported to the mine, and the debris from the collapse has been basically cleared. We can still get some output throughout the winter. Especially gemstones, don't emphasize the price anymore, just sell them as fast as we can. It's always right to store more food and dried meat."



Barov nodded, "I'll handle it, Your Highness. But..."



Seeing the hesitant look on the Minister Assistant's face, Roland knew exactly what he wanted to say, "Don't worry, I have arranged a small boat. If the situation really comes to a complete failure, I will leave the town."

"I can rest assured then." Barov sighed in relief. 

Roland smiled at him, "You go ahead with your work, I'll stay here for a while longer."

After Barov left, the prince slowly ascended the watchtower. This was the highest point in the middle of the city wall. From here, he could overlook the vast forest and the rolling mountains ahead. The cold wind was howling and hitting his face, but he didn't mind. Only on this open high platform, his nervousness facing the imminent battle would calm down. 

"You're lying to him," someone said beside him, "You have no intention of leaving at all."

"Life is already so hard, it's better not to expose some things."

"I don't understand what you're talking about, if being a prince is considered hard, then what are we?" Nightingale appeared, "Even if you can't become a king, as long as you survive the Royal Decree of Succession for these five years, you're still a ruler. Instead of worrying about this, you should spend more time with Anna, I'm afraid... she doesn't have much time left."

Roland was silent for a moment, "I don't think she won't survive the Evil Months."

"Why?"



"She said she wouldn't lose to the demonic plague," he paused, "I believe her."

"You actually believe a witch," Nightingale shook her head, "We are the ones cursed by the devil."

"Really? I also believe in you."

"……"

……

Brian, dressed in casual clothes, stood in front of Ashes' tombstone.

He gently touched the brand-new stone. Carved on the pure white face were the words: "Nameless but always in people's hearts. A hero who sacrificed for Border Town."

"Ashes."

"I have fulfilled my dream. When the Evil Months end, His Highness the Fourth Prince will hold a coronation ceremony for me."



"But I don't want to lie in bed waiting."

"My wounds have healed, I should be on the city wall."

"The Evil Months are approaching, the demonic beasts might be terrifying, but they will crash against the defense line that everyone has united to build, unable to advance a single step."

"I will wield my sword, on your behalf as well, to protect this town."

"Everything is not over yet."

"The person who framed you is still alive... but he won't live forever, this is His Highness's promise to me."

"The next time we meet, I will bring good news."

Brian bent down, placing a bouquet of flowers in front of the tombstone.

"So, goodbye, my friend."



……

"Anna, aren't you scared?" Nana asked, swinging her legs from her position on the bed.

"Scared of what?"

"The Demonic Bite. Nightingale said it happens in the winter. I became a witch in the fall, so this is my first time..."

"Your first time, huh," Anna thought for a moment, "It will be very painful, sometimes you might even wish to die right away."

"Ah!" Nana let out a surprised gasp, quickly covering her mouth.

"But you will survive, just like I did."

"I don't know..." Nana spoke softly, "I'm not as strong as you."

"I'm not that strong either," Anna closed her eyes, the scene of her first meeting with Roland surfacing in her mind. In that dark, cold dungeon, he draped his clothes over her, gently saying he wanted to hire her — even now, she still found it incredible, "You will also find things that make you want to live, even if it means struggling to survive."



"For example...?" 

"Like a juicy, sauce-covered steak," she sighed, "How would I know what you want — hmm?" 

Looking at Nana who was staring intently at herself, Anna wiped her face with her hand,"Is there something dirty on my face?" 

"No..." the latter shook her head, "I'm just a bit surprised, you never used to talk to me this much... Sister Anna, you looked so beautiful just now when you closed your eyes to think." 

Anna rolled her eyes, jumped off the bed, and walked to the window. 

Nana followed her, "What are you looking at, the Misty Forest?" 

"The forest is to the west," Anna replied irritably, "From here you can only see the Redwater River." 

"Sister Anna, look!" The girl pointed to the sky. 

Anna was taken aback, then opened the window, a blast of cold wind mixed with specks of snowflakes rushed into the room.



She extended her hand, pinching the crystal clear snowflake, a chill spreading from her fingertips.

"It's snowing."

...

"..."

After a long silence, Nightingale finally spoke, "You actually didn't lie."

"Of course," Roland laughed, "I rarely lie."

Nightingale didn't say anything else, she turned her head, her eyes filled with an unreadable expression.

Suddenly, she felt a chill on her neck, and she couldn't help but shrink her neck. Looking up, she found that, unknowingly, snowflakes were drifting in the sky above the city wall. The gray sky seemed to be filled with countless white spirits, dancing in the north wind, accompanied by the slogan of the militia's training, flying everywhere.

... The Evil Months had begun.
