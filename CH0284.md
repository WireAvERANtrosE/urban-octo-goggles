## Accompaniment
After the caravan left, Roland let out a long sigh of relief.

At last... the treasury was filling up again.

Eight steam engines were delivered to the three Chambers of Commerce, of which three were produced by Factory No.2 established with the assistance of the Crescent Moon Bay Chamber of Commerce—it must be said that these craftsmen from the Fjords, whether in terms of talent or learning ability, were far superior to the miners and blacksmiths of the town. After mastering the operation of machine tools, the qualified rate of finished products shot up. Perhaps in another two months, the production capacity of Factory No.2 could catch up with that of Factory No.1. Fortunately, according to the contract signed, the sales revenue from these machines all belonged to Roland.



Additionally, he obtained a new hydrogen balloon purchase order from the Crescent Moon Bay caravan. Marland was very interested in this object that could greatly expand one's field of vision. Apart from the single-person reconnaissance balloons, they also specially ordered a giant balloon that could carry three to four people, planning to use it for exploring the new islands of the Fjords.



Together with the delivery of the first paddle steamer, the three brought in nearly seven thousand Gold Royals in revenue for Border Town. After deducting the costs of purchasing metal ingots, cleansing stones, and grain, the remaining six thousand Gold Royals were more than enough to support his population expansion plan.



Roland summoned Barov and Iron Axe to his office.



"Now that we have surplus funds, it's time to recruit more population from other places," he said, eyeing his two capable subordinates. "This operation will be jointly executed by the City Hall and the First Army. You'll decide on the specific personnel. I'll just explain the general content of the task."



"Please go ahead," the chief officer nodded.



"The recruitment is divided into two directions, the North and the Southern Territories," Roland pulled out a map from the desk and spread it out in front of them. "Especially from Eagle City to Clearwater Harbor... I suspect Timothy has already viewed these people as part of the Grace family, a disposable surplus population, so you need to pull them over to our side before he does."



The team dispatched by the City Hall is responsible for recruiting nobles, craftsmen, and other literate individuals, while the primary task of the First Army is to recruit civilians. Unlike the previous focus on propaganda, this time the approach should be more proactive. Do you understand what I mean?



Iron Axe hesitated for a moment, "You mean... forcing them?"



"Cough cough, there's no need to go that far," Roland coughed twice, the style of the Sand People is indeed simple and rough, "for example, distributing food, actively persuading, paying living expenses in advance, and so on." He glanced at Barov, "You should be very clear about this approach."



"Of course, Your Highness, I have assisted ministers and patrol teams in suppressing and pacifying refugee riots many times when I was in the capital," the latter stroked his beard, "Their demands are simple, sometimes just to fill their stomachs, so there's no need to lure them with money, and even avoid mentioning salaries—if the conditions are too generous, they will become suspicious. The destitute nobles are a lot more troublesome, although they are now strapped for cash and no longer in their glory days, they are experienced and have higher demands, and will not travel thousands of miles with us for a piece of bread. At that time, we need to use money and promises to entice them."



Roland clapped his hands in satisfaction, "It's a pity that with so many affairs to attend to in Border Town, you cannot go in person; otherwise, this task could be completed perfectly."



"Rest assured, Your Highness, I will send my most accomplished disciple to go." Barov smiled, "By next year when the city is built, both banks of the Redwater River will be filled with homes."



"There will be such a day."



After the two of them retired, Roland leaned back in his chair to rest for a moment, then decided to go to the backyard of the northern slope to see Anna.



Upon entering, the first thing that caught his eye was the floor covered with metal blocks.



Roland picked up a piece that fit in his palm—they were basically of the same size, about five centimeters in length and width, and their surfaces were not smooth, as if they had been compressed by something. One side even had a number engraved on it. For instance, the piece in his hand was marked with the number "256."

"How is it going, any good findings?" 

"Number 1057 and number 2284, one is exceptionally hard, while the other is outstanding in both hardness and toughness," Anna approached, her face brimming with a bright smile.

"We've already reached more than two thousand?" Roland exclaimed in surprise as he took the record book from Lucia, which was filled with closely packed data. He found the line for 2284 and saw it written, "Carbon content 0.8%, unknown element number four 15.2%."

"Yes, this is much more interesting than shaving gun barrels," Anna blinked, "Mixing other metals into iron blocks can actually cause a dramatic change in their properties, and I really want to know how these metal spheres are combined together."

The exploration being conducted by Anna and Lucia was indeed a work of profound significance.

Roland had the young girl first break down the ore into various raw materials, then Anna would mix them with pure iron in different mass ratios and smelt them to create test pieces, which were then tested for their properties—through the squeezing and stretching of the blackfire, Anna could determine the amount of magic power consumed each time, thereby judging their strength and toughness.

The first additive was clearly carbon.

Though Roland knew that steel was essentially an iron-carbon alloy: too much carbon and it's cast iron, no carbon and it's pure iron, and only when the carbon content falls within a certain range can it be called steel. Moreover, a tiny fluctuation could greatly change the metal's properties, so the first thing to measure was the size of this range.



From the records, it can be seen that prior to No. 1500, the smelting process involved only pure iron and carbon, whereas after No. 1500, new elements began to be added on top of the steel base. Roland understood that with each additional number in the permutation and combination, the possible outcomes would multiply exponentially; this was an extremely prolonged process. Thus, he only allowed Anna to explore this content when there were no pressing manufacturing tasks.



He offered a few words of encouragement to the two witches, then sat to one side, silently admiring Anna’s busy figure from behind.

The autumn sun was still bright, but it no longer carried the scorching heat of summer. He felt a warm and cozy sensation enveloping his body, and a long-missed sense of tranquility washed over him.

After an indeterminate amount of time, the courtyard gradually quieted down. Suddenly, he felt a soft hand rest on his forehead. Opening his half-closed eyes, Lucia was nowhere to be seen, while Anna was sitting in front of him, "You have something you want to say."



"…"



"Your eyes told me so," she said, tilting her head, her hair tips naturally falling like strands of semi-transparent golden silk.



Roland hesitated for a moment before shaking his head resignedly. "I'm just a bit perplexed," he admitted. He briefly explained the population expansion plan to her, "Compared to the initial freedom of choice, we have now resorted to using methods that are half enticing, half coercive in order to save time. Although this is done to avoid them being forcibly conscripted by Timothy and ultimately dying from the pill's erosion, when I think about it seriously, what I'm doing is not too different from him... The only distinction lies in the purpose."



"Doesn't the purpose explain everything?" she asked softly.



"But..."



"I know what you want to say," Anna covered the prince's mouth, "You're worried that they won't appreciate it, and you also can't guarantee that your goals will always be right in the future—being misunderstood for using the wrong means to achieve the right ends, or using the right means but causing irreparable mistakes... You don't know whether the right means or the right results are more important. Am I right?"



"Don't worry," without waiting for his reply, Anna had already stepped forward, her hands cupping Roland's cheeks, and she whispered in his ear, "I'm here... I'll be watching over you."
