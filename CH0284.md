## Accompaniment
After the caravan left, Roland let out a long sigh of relief.

Finally... the treasury was filling up again.

Eight steam engines had been delivered to the three merchant associations, three of which were produced by Factory No. 2, established with the assistance of the Crescent Moon Bay Chamber of Commerce—it had to be said that these craftsmen from the Fjords were far superior in talent and learning ability compared to the miners and blacksmiths of the town. After mastering the operation of the machine tools, the rate of qualified products soared. Perhaps in another two months, Factory No. 2's production capacity could catch up with Factory No. 1. Fortunately, according to the contract signed, the income from the sale of these machines all belonged to Roland.

In addition, he also received a new order for hydrogen balloons from the Crescent Moon Bay caravan. Marland was very interested in these devices that could greatly expand their field of vision. In addition to the single-person reconnaissance balloons, he had specially ordered a giant balloon capable of carrying three to four people, intending to use it for exploring the new islands in the Fjords.

Together with the delivery of the first paddle steamer, the three deals had brought in nearly seven thousand Gold Royals to Border Town. After deducting the cost of purchasing metal ingots, washing stones, and food, the remaining six thousand Gold Royals were enough to support his population expansion plan.

Roland summoned Barov and Iron Axe into his office.

"Now that we have surplus funds, it's time to recruit more people from other regions," he said, eyeing his two capable subordinates. "This operation will be carried out jointly by the City Hall and the First Army. You will decide on the specific personnel; I will only outline the general content of the mission."

"Please go ahead," the Chief Officer said, nodding.

"Recruitment will be in two directions, north and south," Roland said, pulling out a map from the desk and spreading it in front of the two men. "Especially from Eagle City to Clearwater Harbor... I suspect that Timothy has already seen these people as part of the Grace's forces, considered expendable and useless. Therefore, you need to get to them first and win them over."



"The team sent by the City Hall is responsible for recruiting nobles, craftsmen, and other literates, while the First Army's main task is to recruit commoners. Unlike the previous focus on propaganda, this time the approach should be more proactive. Do you understand what I mean?"

Iron Axe hesitated for a moment, "You mean... to force them?"

"Cough cough, there's no need to go that far," Roland coughed twice. The style of the Sand People was indeed simple and crude, "For example, distributing food, actively persuading, and paying living expenses in advance." He glanced at Barov, "You should be quite familiar with this approach."

"Of course, Your Highness, I have assisted ministers and patrol teams in suppressing and pacifying refugee uprisings many times when I was in the capital," the latter stroked his beard, "Their demands are quite simple, sometimes merely to fill their stomachs, so there's no need to woo them with money, and even better not to mention wages—If the conditions are too generous, they will become suspicious. The destitute nobles are much more troublesome, though they are now short of money and no longer illustrious, they are well-informed and have higher demands. They won't follow us for miles just for a piece of bread, and that's when we need to use money and promises to lure them."

Roland clapped his hands with satisfaction, "It's a pity that there are so many affairs in Border Town that you can't personally go there, otherwise this task would certainly be completed perfectly."

"Rest assured, Your Highness, I will send my most promising disciple there." Barov smiled, "By next year when the city is built, both banks of the Redwater River will be covered with homes."

"There will be such a day."

After the two men took their leave, Roland leaned back in his chair to rest for a moment, then decided to go to the backyard on the north slope to see Anna.

Upon entering, the first thing that caught his eye was the metallic blocks scattered all over the ground.



Roland picked up a piece, placing it in the palm of his hand—it was roughly the same size as the others, about five centimeters in length and width, with a surface that was not smooth, as if it had been squeezed by something, and one side was engraved with a number. For instance, the one in his hand bore the mark "No. 256."



"How is it, any good findings?"



"No. 1057 and No. 2284, one is exceptionally hard, while the other is outstanding in both hardness and toughness," Anna said, approaching with a bright smile on her face.



"We've reached over two thousand already?" Roland exclaimed in surprise as he took the record book handed to him by Lucia, its pages densely filled with data. Finding the line for No. 2284, he saw written after the number, "Carbon content 0.8%, unknown element No. 4 15.2%."



"Mhm, this is much more interesting than carving gun barrels," Anna blinked, "Mixing other metals into iron blocks can drastically change their properties. I really want to know how these metal beads are combined together."



The exploration that Anna and Lucia were currently undertaking was indeed a work of profound significance.



Roland first had the young girl break down the ore into various raw materials, then Anna would mix them with pure iron in different mass ratios and smelt them to create test blocks, after which their performance was tested—by the squeezing and stretching of the black fire, Anna could determine the amount of magical power consumed in each operation, and thus judge their strength and toughness.



The first addition was clearly carbon.



Roland understood that steel was essentially an iron-carbon alloy: too much carbon and it was cast iron, no carbon and it was pure iron, and it was only called steel if the carbon content fell within a certain range. Moreover, a slight fluctuation could greatly change the metal's properties, so the first thing to test was the size of this range.



From the records, it can be seen that up to No. 1500, the smelting was simply of iron and carbon, but after No. 1500, new elements began to be added to the steel. Roland was aware that for every additional number in the combination, the possible outcomes would double, making it an extremely lengthy process. Therefore, he only allowed Anna to explore this content when there were no pressing manufacturing tasks.



He offered a few words of encouragement to the two witches, then sat down to the side, quietly admiring Anna's busy figure.



Although the sunlight after the start of autumn was still bright, it no longer carried the scorching intensity of the summer season, and he felt a warm coziness enveloping his body, bringing a long-missed sense of tranquility to his heart.



After an indeterminate amount of time, the courtyard gradually quieted down. He suddenly felt a soft hand on his forehead and, opening his half-closed eyes, Lucia was nowhere to be seen, while Anna was sitting in front of him, "You have something you want to say."



"..."



"Your eyes told me," she said, tilting her head, her hair naturally falling like strands of translucent gold.



Roland hesitated for a moment, then finally shook his head helplessly, "I'm just a bit perplexed." He briefly explained the population expansion plan to her, "Compared to the original freedom of choice, we are now, in order to save time, using methods that are half-enticing, half-coercive. Although this is done to prevent them from being forcibly conscripted by Timothy, ultimately dying from the pill's erosion, when I think about it seriously, what I'm doing isn't too far off from him... The only difference lies in the purpose."



"Can't purpose explain everything?" she asked softly.



"But..."



"I know what you want to say," Anna covered the prince's mouth, "You worry that they might not be grateful, and at the same time, you can't guarantee that your future goals will always be right—being misunderstood for using the wrong methods to achieve the right goals, or using the right methods but causing irreversible mistakes... You don't know whether the right means is more important, or the right outcome is more important. Am I right?"



"Don't worry," before he could answer, Anna had already leaned in, holding Roland's cheeks in her hands and whispering in his ear, "I am here... I will keep a close watch on you."
