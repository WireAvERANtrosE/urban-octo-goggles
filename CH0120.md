## Ransom (Part 2)
Roland looked at Peter with interest and suddenly laughed. "You are the first person to ask me this," he said, picking up his cup and taking a sip of water, speaking in a relaxed tone, "Longsong Stronghold is undoubtedly mine, even if I am not present. However, I do indeed need a person or a family to manage the stronghold on my behalf. So, what you should be asking about is not a ransom, but 'agency fees'."



Agency... Peter was familiar with the term. Some sharp-eyed merchants would always keep an eye on the lands with hefty outputs but whose noble owners had no time or did not care to engage in trade, selling goods on their behalf. To obtain this right, they had to advance a sum of money as a deposit.



"How many Gold Royals do you want?" he asked, taking a deep breath to calm himself.



"It's a long-term process, so there's no need to pay it all at once," Roland paused, "thirty percent of the stronghold's monthly tax revenue, plus one thousand in goods value, and the rest is yours."



It wasn't outrageous, Peter thought. As long as he could fully take over Longsong Stronghold, such a price could even be considered fair. The other party was not joking, he confirmed this; the prince was indeed planning to do so.



A once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, Peter told himself. He and the prince were not enemies. The Duke had failed completely, and his children would be stripped of their inheritance rights. If the allied forces of the six families could not defeat the prince, who else could stop him from actually owning the Western Territory? Aligning with a powerful force was a basic principle for the survival of nobility. If he could gain the prince's approval before the other four families, Honeysuckle would become the largest noble family in the Western Territory.



"Your Highness, why don't you stay here? This castle is much larger than that of Border Town."



"What you really want to ask is why I don't personally manage the stronghold, right?" Roland said, smiling at the somewhat embarrassed Peter, "There are many reasons. For instance, the power dynamics here are too complicated. It would take me a long time to straighten out the relationships, not to mention profiting from them. Supporting a local noble, on the other hand, would presumably allow him to govern this place better than I could. It's a win-win deal. Besides, there are many other reasons, which you can think about on your way back." The prince toyed with his silver cup. "By the way, if I choose you as the agent, you wouldn't seek revenge on me for the Duke, would you?"



"Of course not, Your Highness!" Although the last question was somewhat abrupt, Peter still answered immediately.



The duke is gone, and the first thing the five great families think of is naturally how to divide his territories. Who cares about revenge?

But Peter also knew that the reasons His Highness gave were not the real ones. Too complex a force to sort out? In the face of overwhelming power, he could completely eradicate the leading opposition forces, and it would take at most one to two years for all the nobles to forget the loser, Lion, just as Lion had done in the past. But two years was definitely not enough to build Border Town into a major city like Longsong Stronghold.

Prince Roland must have deeper plans.

"That's good, then this city..."

"I am willing to act on your behalf, Your Highness!" Peter blurted out, but his expression soon became hesitant again, "But the king—no, I mean your brother—may not agree with this outcome. If he appoints a new duke to the Western Territory, I have no power to confront the royal capital."

"You don't need to confront," Roland tossed two letters in front of him. "Take a look at this, and also the document I found in the Duke of Lion's study."

Peter quickly skimmed through the contents of the letters and couldn't help but inhale sharply.

The first letter looked like a secret missive, with the new King Timothy battling Queen Clearwater at Eagle City and suffering a major defeat? The content of the second letter was even more shocking; the document was only half-written, but the Duke of Lion's thoughts of swallowing the Northern Territory and declaring independence were already revealed on paper. With no ending, it was unknown to whom this document was intended to be sent.

He immediately understood the prince's meaning—there was no need to resist because the new king was already too busy with his own troubles. Otherwise, the duke would definitely not have thought of raising his flag in independence; his elite knights were enough to sweep through the Western Territory, but they were still far inferior to the royal capital's Knight's Order.



The secret letter might be forged, but this document is indeed penned by Osmond Ryan, unless the prince has found a witch capable of mimicking another's handwriting... He thought for a moment, then dismissed the speculation. 



The other party had no need to go to great lengths to deceive him. Acting as the proxy for Longsong Stronghold was not a unilateral transaction; if he could not secure his position within the stronghold, the prince would not be able to profit either. Moreover, the duke appointed by Timothy would surely be an enemy of the Fourth Prince.



For Honeysuckle to rise above the four major families, they would need the prince's support. Conversely, to ensure that their beneficial treaty was not abolished, the prince would also need the Helmann family to be more firmly seated in this position.



Realizing this, Peter slowly stood up and bowed to Roland, "The Helmann family is willing to serve you."



"Good," the latter nodded, "However, I cannot decide yet if you will act as the proxy. I have a few questions for you first."



"Your Highness, please ask."



"How do you plan to deal with those forces that oppose you?"



"What is your estimate of the monthly tax revenue? How will you ensure the supply of a thousand units of materials?"



"If I ask you to greatly develop commerce and trade, what measures do you have?"



"..."

Peter originally thought that His Highness only wanted to take this opportunity to learn about the intelligence of the nobles from the Western Region, but he didn't expect the other party to ask such strange questions. It was almost like an assessment of his governance methods and knowledge of commerce and trade.



After a series of questions, Peter racked his brains to answer each one, and His Highness's expression seemed more and more satisfied. Finally, he clapped his hands and said, "Good, that will be all for today. Once you have determined the ransom of three thousand values, you can come to redeem Lord Baron. Rest assured, I will treat him well in the coming days."



"Your Highness, about the proxy rights..."



"They will be announced on that day as well." Roland gestured for the knight to show the guest out.



Peter walked out of the hall with mixed feelings, only to see Carter stuffing the God's Punishment Stone that had been confiscated earlier back into his hands—it was still the same translucent azure stone, worth fifty Gold Royals.



...

"How did it go?" Roland looked at Nightingale, who had appeared beside him.



"Um, mostly the truth," she shrugged, "Much more sincere than the previous ones. But coming back to it, is it really okay for you to repeat the same words to everyone? And those letters, they contain confidential information, don't they?"



"Not everyone," the prince flipped through the list in his hand, "they all come from the five major families, and only these nobles are suitable to manage the stronghold on my behalf. Those who are not powerful enough, even if they take this position, cannot get the stronghold up and running. They would only plunge all parties into endless infighting. As for the news of Timothy Wimbledon's defeat at Eagle City, it's hardly a secret. Word of it will eventually spread throughout the entire Greycastle. My job is to make it spread a bit faster."



Moreover, these two pieces of news had come at just the right time, he thought. If it weren't for the Second Prince's disastrous defeat, recruiting an agent would have required more effort on his part—if he had resorted to coercion, the results might not have been so favorable.



"So... you've chosen him?" 



"If everything goes as planned." Roland said with a smile, "He was the first to proactively inquire about this matter, and initiative has always been the most important quality in an employee. And to my surprise, there are indeed people so skilled in administration and trade among the five major families. I had thought they were only good at riding horses and fighting."



He found the name Peter Helmann on the list and lightly circled it with a goose feather pen.
