## Ransom (Part 2)
Roland looked at Petrov with interest, and suddenly laughed, "You are the first person to ask me this," he picked up his cup and took a sip of water, speaking in a relaxed tone, "Longsong Stronghold is undoubtedly mine, even if I am not present here. However, I do indeed need a person or a family to manage the stronghold on my behalf. So, what you should be asking about is not a ransom, but an 'agency fee.'"



Agency... Petrov was familiar with the term. Some sharp-eyed merchants would always eye the lands with substantial output but whose noble owners had no time or disdain for trade, to sell their goods on their behalf. To obtain this right, they had to pay an advance sum as a security deposit.



"How many Gold royals do you want?" he inhaled deeply, trying to calm himself.



"This is a long-term process, so there's no need to pay it all at once," Roland paused, "Thirty percent of the stronghold's monthly tax revenue, plus a thousand worth of supplies, and the rest is yours."



It wasn't an outrageous demand, Petrov thought. As long as he could fully take over Longsong Stronghold, such a price could even be considered fair. He confirmed that the other party was not joking; His Highness the Prince was indeed planning to do so.



A once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, Petrov told himself. He and the prince were not enemies; the duke had been thoroughly defeated, and his children would be stripped of their inheritance rights. If the alliance of the six great families could not defeat the prince, who else could stop him from actually owning the Western Territory? Aligning with a powerful force was a basic rule for the survival of nobility. If he could gain the prince's approval before the other four families, the Honeysuckle family would become the largest noble household in the Western Territory.



"Your Highness, why don't you stay here? This castle is much bigger than Border Town."



"What you really want to ask is why I don't personally manage the stronghold, right?" Roland looked at Petrov, who was a bit embarrassed, and smiled, "There are many reasons, such as the power structure here being too complicated. It would take a long time for me to straighten out the relationships, not to mention profiting from them. Supporting a local noble, I presume he would know better than I how to govern this place, making it a win-win deal. Besides, there are many other reasons, which you can think about on your way back." The prince toyed with the silver cup, "By the way, if I choose you as the agent, you wouldn't seek revenge on me for the duke, would you?"



"Of course not, Your Highness!" Despite the suddenness of the last question, Petrov immediately responded.



The duke is gone, and the first thing the five major families think of is naturally how to divide his territory. Who cares about revenge?

However, Pero also knew that the reasons His Highness mentioned were not the real ones. Too complicated to sort out the forces? With overwhelming power, he could completely eradicate any opposition here, and it would take only one to two years at most for all the nobles to forget the loser, Osmond, just as he had done in the past. But two years was definitely not enough to build Border Town into a major city like Longsong Stronghold.

Prince Roland must have deeper plans.

"That's good, then this city..."

"I am willing to act on your behalf, Your Highness!" Pero blurted out, but soon his expression became hesitant again, "But the king—no, I mean your brother, may not agree with this outcome. If he assigns a new duke to the Western Territory, I have no power to confront the royal capital."

"You don’t need to confront them," Roland tossed two letters in front of him. "Look at this, and the document I found in Duke Ryan’s study."

Pero quickly scanned the contents of the letters and couldn't help but inhale sharply.

The first letter looked like a secret missive, with the new King Timothy engaging in battle with Queen of Clearwater at Eagle City and suffering a major defeat? The second letter was even more shocking; the document was only half-written, but Duke Ryan’s intention to annex the Northern Territory and declare independence was clearly revealed on paper. Since there was no conclusion, it was unknown whom this document was intended to be sent to.

He immediately understood the prince’s intention—there was no need to resist because the new king was already too preoccupied with his own troubles. Otherwise, the duke would never have thought of declaring independence; his elite knights were enough to sweep through the Western Territory, but they were still far inferior to the royal knights of the capital.



The secret letter might be forged, but this document is indeed in Osmond Ryan's handwriting, unless the prince has found a witch capable of imitating another's writing... He thought about it, then immediately dismissed the guess.

There was no need for the other party to go through such great lengths to deceive him. Acting as the regent of Longsong Stronghold wasn't a unilateral transaction—if he couldn't secure a firm foothold in the stronghold, His Highness the Prince would not be able to profit either. Moreover, the duke appointed by Timothy would certainly be an enemy of the Fourth Prince.

To rise above the four major families, Honeysuckle needed the Prince's support, and conversely, to ensure that their interests and treaty were not abolished, the Prince also needed to ensure that the Honeysuckle Family held this position more firmly.

Thinking this, Petro slowly stood up and bowed to Roland, "The Honeysuckle Family is willing to serve you."

"Very well," the latter nodded. "However, I can't decide yet if you'll be the regent. Let me ask you a few questions first."

"Please ask, Your Highness."

"How do you plan to deal with the forces that oppose you?"

"What is your estimate for the monthly tax revenue? How do you plan to ensure the provision of goods worth a thousand points?"

"If I ask you to vigorously develop commerce and trade, what measures do you have?"



"......"

Petro originally thought that His Highness merely wanted to take this opportunity to understand the information about the nobles of the Western Region. He did not expect that the other party would ask such strange questions, which seemed like an assessment of his governance methods and commercial knowledge.



After a series of questions, Petro racked his brains to answer each one, and His Highness's expression seemed more and more satisfied. Finally, he clapped his hands and said, "Not bad, that will be all for today. Once you have determined the ransom of three thousand points, you can come to redeem the Earl. Rest assured, I will treat him well these days."



"Your Highness, about the regency..."



"They will be announced on that day as well." Roland gestured for the knight to show the guest out.



Petro left the hall with mixed feelings and then saw Carter stuffing the previously confiscated Divine Stone of Judgement back into his hands—it was still the same translucent azure, the one worth fifty Gold royals.



......



"How was it?" Roland looked at Nightingale, who had revealed herself beside him.



"Um, most of what he said was true," she shrugged, "much more sincere than the previous ones. But is it really okay for you to repeat the same thing to everyone? And those letters, they contain confidential information, don't they?"



"Not every person," the prince flipped through the list in his hand, "they all come from the five major families, and only these nobles are suitable to manage the stronghold on my behalf. Those without sufficient power, even if they take up this position, will not be able to get the stronghold running and will only plunge the various forces into endless internal strife. As for the news of Timothy Wimbledon's defeat at Eagle City, it's no secret. It's a matter that will sooner or later spread throughout the whole of the kingdom. What I need to do is to make it spread even faster."



Moreover, these two pieces of news came just at the right time, he thought. If it hadn't been for the second prince's disastrous defeat, it would have probably taken him quite an effort to recruit a proxy— and if he had resorted to coercion, the outcome might not have been so favorable.



"So... have you chosen him?"



"If everything goes as expected," Roland said with a smile, "he was the first to take the initiative to ask me about this matter, and proactivity has always been the most important quality in an employee. Besides, I didn't expect that someone from the five families would be so skilled in administration and trade. I originally thought they were only good at charging around on horseback."



He found the name Petrov Hull in the list and lightly circled it with his quill.
