## Aerial Strike Preparation
After nearly a week of assembly and testing, Roland and Anna completed the development of the bomb contact fuse together.



Compared to the fuse of an artillery shell, it did not need to withstand high temperatures and pressures, nor did it have to endure the high G-forces of being fired from a barrel, so its structure was exceptionally simple. However, even with a device made up of just a firing pin and a spring, the two tested it many times before succeeding.



The main problem was that no one knew how much force was needed for the spring, so that it wouldn't accidentally discharge if dropped, yet would still ensure that the firing pin could reliably trigger the primer during a normal throw.



He and Anna could only test this bit by bit by changing the thickness and hardness of the spring.



Fortunately, the latter and Lucia had done a lot of preliminary work on normal days, so Roland had an increasing number of high-quality materials at his disposal. The final choice that passed the tests was Alloy Steel No. 1365, which was harder and less tough, ensuring that even if the bomb fell from a height of one meter, it would not be compressed to the bottom.



Once the appropriate spring was selected, the rest was easy. Even though Roland had never seen a real fuse, he could design one based on its working principle.



It was definitely primitive, but it was sufficient for the clumsy, large, and rough aerial bombs.



The completed contact fuse looked like a cylinder, twelve centimeters long and about five centimeters in diameter, with a threaded bottom that could be screwed into the opening at the top of the bomb.



Inside, there was a concave slot with a downward bulge, and the firing pin was similarly shaped to fit exactly into the slot. Under normal conditions, its upper part was held at the mouth of the slot by a spring, with the firing pin falling into the concave slot, exactly one finger's width from the primer. To be safe, Roland also drilled an extra hole in the head of the firing pin and fixed it to the shell with a pin. This iron rod had to be pulled out before the bomb was dropped, allowing the firing pin to move up and down.



The simulated bombing test was conducted on a sunny and breezy afternoon.

As the bomb, once filled with gravel and black powder, weighed nearly as much as five Nightingales, Roland did not board the hot air balloon. Instead, he observed from three hundred meters away from the drop zone with a telescope.

Besides him, observing the trial were the First Army commander, Iron Axe, and the Chief Knight, Carter Lannis.

"You plan to use a hot air balloon to drop a giant explosive package into the palace?" After listening to Roland's battle plan, Carter could hardly believe his own ears. Launching an attack from two thousand meters in the sky, ignoring the city walls and defensive forces, completely overturned his previous concepts of warfare—of course, in Border Town, he had already been overturned many times over the past year.

"As long as it's well-controlled, it's not impossible," Roland nodded, "Timothy is currently conscripting new militia units, and if we can't stop him, the Western Territory will inevitably suffer another attack from the drug-taking army. Even if we win, it won't bring us any benefits."

The secret letter sent by Theo indicated that Timothy still intended to use his old tactics to wear down his own strength, and it was uncertain whether the envoys sent out by Barov could bring more people to Border Town before the other side.

"If you truly manage to drop the Wrath of Heaven upon Timothy's head, he will surely be scared out of his wits!" Iron Axe said excitedly, "It would be an irresistible divine punishment!"

"I hope so," Roland smiled.

Although Theo mentioned in his letter that Timothy had likely figured out the formula for black powder and had set up workshops in the inner city area to try to mass-produce this dangerous substance, after much consideration, Roland still chose to target the area above the palace.



The reason is simple, because the palace is conspicuous enough.

Looking down from a height of two thousand meters, even the most magnificent city in Greycastle is only the size of half a palm, so it is necessary to find the drop point in advance when bombing. The royal palace is right in the center of the inner city, surrounded by red tile walls, with the palace roof paved with pure white slabs, making it particularly eye-catching during the fall, and it's almost impossible to mistake the target.



But the workshop is different.

He did not have a layout plan of the King's City on hand, and there were no ground guides, making it difficult to clearly describe the location of the target using only language. In addition, the workshop itself is not large, and if the bombs deviate and fall into residential buildings, the plan would be counterproductive.



Suddenly, a white shadow plummeted to the ground, kicking up a column of smoke at the test site, followed by a dull thud.

"It seems that the bomb has hit the ground," Roland put away his telescope, "Let's go and see the result."



After a week of training, Lightning's bombing skills had improved significantly. The aerial bomb fell less than five meters from the target center, with the bomb body completely buried in the mud, and the casing was severely deformed upon impact.



When the Seagull landed, Anna used Blackfire to cut open the bomb, and everyone saw that the mud near the detonator had turned scorched black—this proved that the high-temperature gas from the primer ignited the Blackpowder sprinkled on the surface of the mud, and the detonator itself was working properly. If the inside of the bomb had been filled with nitrocellulose, it could easily create a crater four to six meters deep and kill unsheltered personnel within a fifty-meter radius.



Now that the aerial bomb had been developed, the next step was to arrange the combat plan.



Roland's gaze swept over everyone, and he slowly began to speak, "The plan to launch a surprise attack on the capital will be executed next Monday. First, Iron Axe, you will lead a team of fifty musketeers to escort the witches to the outskirts of Silver City. There is a mountainous area there that can block the line of sight, making it suitable for setting up camp or launching balloons."

"At your command, Your Highness!" Iron Axe responded.

"Aren't we flying directly from Border Town?" Wendy asked.

"No, that's too far," Roland shook his head. It would take at least a week to travel from the Western Territory to the capital, and about three days to fly directly with the Seagull. Counting the return trip, that's six days. The gondola, after being fitted with a throwing frame, could only carry two people, and Nightingale would not be able to accompany them. Among the four witches, apart from Anna, none had combat capabilities. Spending six nights in the wilderness was too risky, and he couldn't rest easy with that. "If you set out from Silver City, you'll only need one day to complete the bombing and return before sunset."

"Next are the witches. The personnel for this mission are Anna, Wendy, Lightning, Maggie, Nightingale, and Sylvie. The latter two are in charge of monitoring the surroundings of the camp, and the attack process will be carried out by the first four following the training methods, especially Lightning," he looked at the young girl, "whether we succeed or not is up to you."

"Leave it to me," the latter said, patting her chest.

"So the last thing I want to say is, be safe," Roland said word by word, "I'll be waiting for you in Border Town."

Four days later, the first bomb 'Eastwind No. 1' was loaded onto a wagon, and under the escort of the First Army, it boarded a cargo ship bound for Silver City.
