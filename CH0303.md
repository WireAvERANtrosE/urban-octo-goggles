## Airstrike Preparation
After nearly a week of assembly and testing, Roland and Anna together completed the development work on the bomb detonating fuse.

Compared to the fuse of artillery shells, it did not need to withstand high temperatures and pressures, nor the high G-overload when fired, so its structure was exceptionally simple. However, despite being a device made up of a firing pin and a spring, they had to test it many times before succeeding.

The main problem was that no one knew how strong the spring needed to be to prevent accidental discharge if dropped, while also ensuring that the firing pin would reliably activate the primer during normal throwing.

Roland and Anna could only test this bit by bit by changing the thickness and hardness of the spring.

Fortunately, Anna and Lucia had done a lot of preliminary work on a daily basis, so Roland had more and more high-quality materials at hand. The final tested material was Alloy Steel No. 1365, which had a higher hardness and lower toughness, ensuring that even if the bomb fell from a height of one meter, it wouldn't compress all the way to the bottom.

Once the appropriate spring was selected, the rest fell into place. Even though Roland had never seen what a real fuse looked like, he could design one based on its working principle.

It was definitely primitive, but it was sufficient for the crude and bulky aerial bombs.

The completed touch fuse looked like a cylinder, twelve centimeters long and about five centimeters in diameter, with threads on the bottom that could be screwed into the opening on top of the bomb.

Inside, there was a concave groove with a downward bulge, and the firing pin had a similar shape, fitting perfectly into the groove. In its normal state, the upper part of the pin was held in place at the mouth of the groove by the spring, with the striking needle falling into the groove, exactly one finger's distance from the primer. For safety, Roland also drilled an extra hole in the head of the firing pin and fixed it to the shell with a pin. This iron rod had to be pulled out before dropping the bomb, allowing the striking needle to move up and down.



The simulation test was conducted on a sunny and breezy afternoon.

Since the bomb had reached nearly the weight of five Nightingales after being filled with gravel and black powder, Roland did not board the hot air balloon. Instead, he watched from three hundred meters away from the drop site using a telescopic lens.

Besides him, those attending the test included the First Army Commander, Iron Axe, and the Chief Knight, Carter Lannis.

"You plan to drop a giant bomb package into the palace using a hot air balloon?" After listening to Roland's battle plan, Carter could hardly believe his ears. Launching an attack from two thousand meters in the sky, ignoring walls and defensive forces, completely overturned his previous concepts of warfare—of course, in Border Town, he had been overturned many times already in the past year.

"As long as it's controlled properly, it's not impossible to achieve," Roland nodded, "Timothy is currently conscripting new militia forces. If we can't stop him, the Western Region will inevitably suffer another attack from the drug-fueled army. Even if we win, it won't bring us any benefit."

The secret letter sent by Tassa indicated that Timothy still intended to use his usual tactics to exhaust his own strength, and it was uncertain whether the envoy team sent by Barov could recruit more people to Border Town before the other side.

"If you really can drop the Wrath of Thunder onto Timothy's head, he would definitely be scared out of his wits!" Iron Axe said excitedly, "It's an irresistible divine punishment!"

"Hopefully so," Roland smiled.

Despite Tassa mentioning in the letter that Timothy might have already figured out the formula for black powder and was trying to mass-produce this dangerous substance by setting up workshops in the inner city area, after much consideration, Roland still decided to target the space above the palace.



The reason is simple: the palace is conspicuous enough.

Looking down from a height of two kilometers, even the most magnificent city of Greycastle is only the size of half a palm, so it's necessary to identify the drop point in advance when bombing. The royal palace is right in the center of the inner city district, surrounded by red tile walls, with the palace roof all laid with pure white slabs, which makes it particularly eye-catching during the fall, making it almost impossible to mistake the target.

But the workshop is different.

He didn't have a layout plan of the capital at hand, there were no guides on the ground, and it was difficult to describe the location of the target clearly with just words. Besides, the workshop itself is not large, and if a bomb were to stray and fall into the residential area, the plan would be more of a loss than a gain.

Suddenly, a white shadow plunged to the ground, causing a column of smoke to rise in the testing ground, followed by a dull thud.

"It seems that the bomb has hit the ground," Roland put away his telescope, "Let's go and see the results."

After a week of training, Lightning's bombing skills had improved significantly. The airdropped bomb fell less than five meters from the target center, with the body of the bomb buried entirely in the soil, and the casing deformed significantly upon impact.

When the Seagull landed, Anna used the Blackfire to cut open the bomb, and everyone saw that the soil near the fuze had turned a scorched black—this proved that the high-temperature gas from the primer had ignited the black powder scattered on the surface of the soil, and the fuze itself worked properly. If the bomb had been filled with nitrocellulose, it could easily create a crater four to six meters deep and kill any uncovered personnel within a fifty-meter radius.

Now that the development of the aerial bomb was complete, the next step was to arrange the battle plan.



Roland's gaze swept over everyone, and he slowly began to speak, "The surprise attack on the capital plan will be executed next Monday. First will be Iron Axe; you will lead a team of fifty musketeers to escort the witches to the outskirts of Silver City. There is a mountainous area there which can block the view, making it suitable for setting up camp or launching the balloon."

"At your command, Your Highness!" Iron Axe responded.

"Won't we fly directly from Border Town?" Wendy asked.

"No, that's too far," Roland shook his head. It would take at least a week to travel from the Western Territory to the capital, and about three days for the Seagull to fly directly, totaling six days for the round trip. The gondola, after being fitted with a throwing frame, could only carry two people; Nightingale couldn't accompany them, and of the four witches, aside from Anna, none had combat abilities. Spending six nights in the wild was too risky; he couldn't rest easy. "If you start from Silver City, you can complete the bombing in one day and return before the sunset."

"Next are the witches; the personnel for this mission will be Anna, Wendy, Lightning, Maggie, Nightingale, and Sylvie. The last two will be responsible for monitoring the situation around the camp, and the first four will carry out the attack as trained, especially Lightning," he looked at the young girl, "whether we succeed or not depends on you."

"Leave it to me," the latter replied, patting her chest.

"The last thing I want to say is, be safe," Roland articulated each word, "I'll be waiting for you in Border Town."

Four days later, the first bomb 'Eastwind No. 1' was loaded onto a carriage and, under the escort of the First Army, boarded a cargo ship heading to Silver City.
