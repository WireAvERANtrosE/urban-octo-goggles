## Origin
"Lady Tilly!"

Upon entering the lord's castle under Nightingale's guidance, the fifth princess did not expect that the first to greet her would be Sylvie. She ran towards her cheerfully, disregarding the formalities, and hugged her tightly, "What brings you here, it's still autumn!"

"There isn't much difference from winter," Tilly said with a smile, "Where are the others?"

"Lily is building housing for the refugees, Evelyn and Candle are likely still in the industrial zone, and Honey is training the messenger birds in the back garden," Sylvie counted on her fingers, "His Highness has already sent someone to notify them."

"Don't worry, I think you'll be seeing them very soon." A somewhat familiar yet strangely unfamiliar voice came from behind Sylvie.

Tilly looked up to see a man with gray hair smiling at her. His features had not changed much from her memories, but his smile and demeanor were completely different from before.

"Welcome to Border Town, my dear sister."

...

A torrent of thoughts swirled in Tilly's mind, she had many questions she wanted to blurt out, but she still maintained a calm demeanor as she followed Roland Wimbledon into what appeared to be a study.



"Please sit," the other party poured a cup of warm tea and handed it to me, "It's been a whole year since we last saw each other, I know you have a lot to talk to me about, and I feel the same... But there's no need to hurry," he glanced at the snowy scene outside the window, "Winter this year is still very long."



She held the cup but did not respond, instead sitting down by the mahogany table, quietly observing the Fourth Prince.



From this opening alone, Tilly could tell that this was not something the brother she remembered could say—he was timid and cowardly, outwardly tough but hollow inside, and most importantly, accustomed to evasion, never thinking of confronting issues head-on. The Roland Wimbledon before her was entirely different; he was trying to take control of the conversation, and despite his gentle and calm tone, he exuded the air of a superior.



"Nightingale." Roland tilted his head.



"But Your Highness..." the voice of the guiding witch echoed in the room.



"It's alright, she's my sister."



"Okay then." Nightingale was silent for a while before she revealed herself and reluctantly left the room.



"Now it's just you and me." He smiled and returned to the table.



Tilly was silent for a moment, "Who... are you really?"



She had originally thought that he would hesitate or speak in riddles, but he answered very quickly, "I am your brother, Roland Wimbledon, the Fourth Prince of Greycastle." Then he smiled, "I know I've changed a lot, but I am willing to explain it to you slowly."



Tilly suddenly remembered what he had written in his letter—"As for what made me come to this decision, and what has stopped me from being indifferent to everything like I used to be, these trivial matters can be discussed in detail when we have the chance." Perhaps it was this sentence that made her decide to come to this remote town.



She couldn't help but curl the corners of her mouth, "I will listen carefully."



The whole story was not complicated, yet it was very engaging. After listening to Roland's entire experience after being assigned to Border Town, Tilly found her teacup empty. She took a deep breath and went over his narrative again. In short, a witch named Anna touched Roland, and through the witches he saved, he saw the evil of the Church and its bewitchment of the people. Then Grace's assassination attempt made him feel the darkness under the royal power; even hiding in the corner, he could not escape the omnipresent malice, and he finally decided to change everything.



Although this part sounded somewhat dramatic, it was a plausible explanation. However, the problem was with the odd knowledge he had, whether it was the steam engine or the musket; it was impossible to know such things just from a moment of enlightenment.



"So, the ultimate factor that caused all this was the memories that suddenly appeared in your head?" Tilly asked.



"Indeed," Roland said earnestly, "I know it's hard to believe, but that's the truth... After I luckily survived the assassination by my third sister’s hands, I woke up from the coma and realized all these things. If meeting Anna was the catalyst, then the content in my memories is the driving force for my desire to change the status quo."



Was it a witch? Tilly thought to herself. The possibilities of replacement and control were slim; Sylvie had already confirmed that—the abilities of the witches from the United Front were not mysterious, as they had to undergo special training every day, and none of their abilities fell into these two categories, not even close.



The only possibility was possession, she did not rule out that there was such an ability that could occupy a body and thus gain the thoughts of another. But this guess was equally faint; Roland Wimbledon, no matter how little his father thought of him, was undoubtedly the Prince of Greycastle. The Divine Stone of Judgement was not rare for him, and he was always protected by knights and personal guards, making it impossible for a witch without concealing abilities to approach him easily.



Moreover, even if there were such a witch, how could she possibly possess such extraordinary knowledge? She had scoured the royal library in her childhood and had been taught by several white-haired, erudite court tutors, but even they had never spoken of the knowledge of using steam and gunpowder to replace animal power and swords.



It seems that bizarre knowledge matches bizarre experiences.



"How can you prove that you are Roland Wimbledon, and not just some additional memories?" Tilly knew her question was rather impolite. The former Fourth Prince would have been furious and stormed off, overturning tables in his rage.



"Because I still remember the things that happened in the palace," he replied calmly, "I think what defines a person's essence is their unique memories. If a witch became exactly like you but with different memories, she would essentially still be someone else. I have a lot of strange memories that I don't know where they come from. But the image of you crying on the broken glass shards, I still remember it vividly, so that's my proof." He paused, "Of course... I've always meant to apologize to you, and I hope it's not too late."



Tilly remained silent, the Roland in front of her was neatly dressed and sincere in demeanor, speaking as if stating an indisputable fact. Clearly, by all accounts, he was much better than the former playboy prince. But doubts lingered in her heart.



"It's... unbelievable."



"That's normal," Roland seemed to have seen through her thoughts, "Many things seem incredible until you've experienced them yourself. I never expected that my sister would awaken as a witch and conceal it from everyone in the palace. However... as I said at the beginning, the winter is still long, and we can take our time to understand each other."



This was probably the best solution for now, Tilly nodded, "Then for the coming months... I'll be counting on you."



"Leave it to me, you will come to like this place."
