## Resolution
"Your Majesty, why is there still no news from my brother?"

Edith's words made Timothy pause slightly. Indeed, it had been two months since Raymond had been sent to raid the Western Territory. Including the round-trip journey, there should have been some report of the situation by now, or a return to the capital.

Even though one of the tasks given to Raymond was "to seize control of the Western Territory as much as possible," Timothy knew in his heart that the one thousand five hundred men who had taken the pills were almost incapacitated. It was unlikely they could take over the Western Territory, so the main objective was still to seize the pills within the stronghold church, find out the details of the duke's battle, and finally attack Border Town to deplete a round of Roland's living forces.

This tactic had worked well against Grace. Even if they hadn't taken Clearwater Port, and the militia used to exhaust the opponent had been completely wiped out, most of the knights leading the teams could return safely. As long as another group of expendables were gathered, they could launch another attack.

But why was there no news at all from Raymond and that group of knights?

"Perhaps he was delayed in returning due to the attack on the town, or maybe he is on his way back," Timothy said slowly. The persuasiveness of these reasons was obviously weak, but he didn't want to speak the most likely answer in front of Raymond's brother. "Perhaps by the time I return to the capital, I will have received a message from him."

"Then, Your Majesty, when the time comes, could you please..."

"Tell you the news about him?" Timothy nodded. "Of course, I will send a messenger with the information."

"Thank you, Your Majesty!"



The new king leaned against the railing, watching the occasional flashes of light in the dark clouds. The sound of thunder seemed to come from far away, not loud, yet deep and resonant, as if striking directly at the heart.



Edith's question had diminished the joy in his heart. If Grace Wimbledon's resistance was to be expected, and Tilly Wimbledon's departure had been a major disappointment, then Roland Wimbledon's actions were utterly baffling. He had thought that this incapable brother of his wouldn't need much attention, that after a while, he would grow tired of the impoverished town life and perhaps even come to the capital on his own. But the reality had completely exceeded his expectations.



Staying in Border Town, safely getting through the Months of Demons, defeating Duke Lion, taking over the Longsong Stronghold, and even causing Remy's fifteen hundred militia to lose all contact—how on earth had he managed all that?



Timothy had never made an effort to understand this brother. As children, whether it was Grace or Herman, none loved to play with him. As an adult, he only saw him at court banquets. Yet, the tales of his mischief were endless, and even their father was not fond of him. Could it be that from the beginning, he had been concealing his true nature?



Timothy quickly dismissed the thought. Even his clever fifth sister only showed her intelligence in learning ability and quick thinking; as a child, her temperament was no different from that of an ordinary girl—how could a person be born knowing how to disguise and deceive? He must have encountered something after going to Border Town that brought about this change.



Timothy shook his head, casting these distracting thoughts aside.



"What is it, Your Majesty?"



"No, it's nothing," the new king took a breath, "The storm is coming soon."



Regardless of what he encountered, the population and location of Border Town meant there was no way out for him—no port, no fleet, with an impassable wild land at his back. He could only hold out in that corner until he was exhausted by his own relentless assaults.



"Do you insist on leaving tomorrow?" the knight asked anxiously.



"If we stop at a little rain, then how are we to face the real storm?" Timothy turned around and said. Roland Wimbledon will sooner or later kneel before me begging for forgiveness, and the crown of the King of Graycastle will surely sit firmly on my head. However, these are but the opening acts. The movements and intentions of the Church are becoming more and more clear, and one day, Graycastle will have to contend with the Church. That will be the true challenge. "Go and attend to your duties. The sooner you complete the task I have entrusted to you, the sooner you can return to the capital."



"By your command, Your Majesty."



Edith took two steps away, then turned back to ask, "I almost forgot, Your Majesty, what should we do with those who have taken the pills and yet did not die on the battlefield? This is their third dose."



"Let them be incinerated along with Clearwater Harbor," he replied expressionlessly.



The knight took his leave, and Timothy suddenly felt a chill on the tip of his nose. Raising his head, he saw rainwater falling from the clouds, at first just a few sparse drops, then increasing in intensity, and soon it began to ripple across the sea surface.



...



At the top of the Tower of Babel in the New Holy City of Hermes.



"Damn it, damn it all!" Tefren pounded the table furiously. "That bitch raised by a dog! The blasphemer! How dare she point her spear at the Church!?"



Mayne had never seen the archbishop lose his composure like this before. The veins on his forehead bulged, his beard trembled with anger, and his face twisted as though he wanted to devour his opponent alive.

It was hard to imagine that normally, he complained incessantly about Hesse, and the two could argue for an entire afternoon over a few words. But when he saw the jewelry box sent by Queen Clearwater, the old man erupted in astonishing fury.

Inside the jewelry box, there was no pearl, only an iron-cast ring—a bishop's insignia personally bestowed by the Pope, worn on a severed finger stained with blood.

Mayne sighed, reached out to close the jewelry box, and said, "Of course she dares, because we have not received the blessing of the gods—God... only favors the victor."

This statement brought Tavolin back to his senses. He sat down in his chair without a word, breathing heavily, before finally managing to squeeze out, "What do you plan to do next?"

This was indeed a situation the Church had not encountered in nearly a century. No one had expected Grace to travel thousands of miles from Greycastle to Everwinter, and after seizing the capital, to send the Black Sail Fleet towards Hermes. Although Wolfheart was on the brink of being conquered, Mayne did not hesitate to recall the entire God's Punishment Army back to the Old Holy City.

This city, without walls, was the barrier of the Hermes mechanism and could not be lost under any circumstances.

After the offensive halted, the Black Sail Fleet did not continue to advance but returned along the river to the capital—clearly, the opponent's intention was very obvious. As long as the Church deployed its army to attack Wolfheart, Grace would launch an assault on the Holy City by water. This sudden intervention by the royal power made the nobles of Everwinter restless once again. Mayne believed that as long as these greedy individuals could continue to hold their lands and wealth, they would not hesitate to support Grace as the new Queen of Everwinter.

The current predicament was no longer something he could easily resolve.



But the Church would not be subdued by such difficulties. Even before he became a bishop, he understood that the path he was to walk was one of thorns.

"First, the Holy City needs to replenish a new bishop. You make a list of candidates, and the final choice will be decided by the Pope," Mayne said slowly.

"What about the enemy?" Tefren snorted through his nostrils.

"I will explain everything to the Pope, don't worry," he closed his eyes, "His Majesty will have the divine judgement."
