## Determination
"Your Majesty, why is there still no news from my brother?"

Aidy's words made Timothy pause for a moment. Indeed, it had been two months since Rayman Hoss was sent to plunder the Western Territory. Counting the round trip, he should have reported back or returned to the capital by now.



Although one of the tasks assigned to Rayman was 'to take control of the Western Territory if possible', Timothy was well aware that the fifteen hundred men, after taking the pills, were almost useless. It was unlikely that they could occupy the Western Territory, so the main objective remained to seize the pills in the fortress church, to ascertain the details of the Battle of the Dukes, and finally to attack Border Town to deplete a round of Roland's living forces.



This tactic had been tried and tested against Grace. Even if they failed to take Clearwater Port, the militia forces used to wear down the opponent were entirely wiped out, and the leading knights could mostly return safely. With another assembly of expendable people, they could launch another attack.



But why was there no news at all from Rayman Hoss and his group of knights?



"Perhaps he delayed his return because of the attack on the town, or maybe he is on his way back," Timothy slowly said, his reasons clearly not very persuasive, but he did not want to speak the most likely answer in front of Rayman's brother. "Maybe by the time I return to the capital, I will have received a message from him."



"Then, Your Majesty, may I ask you to..."

"To inform you of his news?" Timothy nodded, "Of course, I will send a messenger to you."

"Thank you, Your Majesty!"



The new king leaned against the railing, watching the occasional flashes of light in the dark clouds. The sound of thunder seemed to come from afar, not loud, but deep and muffled, as if striking directly at the heart.



Garcia's question had diminished his joy considerably. It was natural for Grace Wimbledon to resist, and he was greatly disappointed by Tilly Wimbledon's departure, but Roland Wimbledon's actions were utterly incomprehensible. He had thought that this incompetent brother did not warrant his attention and would grow tired of the impoverished town life after a while, possibly even coming to the capital on his own accord. However, the actual situation had far exceeded his expectations.



To stay in Border Town, to get through the Evil Months safely, to defeat Duke Ryan, to take the Longsong Stronghold, and even to completely lose contact with Remy's fifteen hundred militia—how on earth did he do it?



Timothy had never taken a close look at this brother. As children, neither Grace nor Herman liked to include him in their play, and after reaching adulthood, they only saw each other at court banquets. Yet, tales of his mischief were endless, and even their father was not fond of him. Could it be that from the beginning, he had been hiding his true nature?



Timothy quickly dismissed the thought. Even someone as clever as his fifth sister showed her intelligence only in learning and quick thinking; her childhood behavior was no different from that of any ordinary girl—how could a person be born knowing how to conceal and deceive? It must have been something he encountered after going to Border Town that brought about such a change.



Timothy shook his head, casting these stray thoughts from his mind.



"What is it, Your Majesty?"



"No, nothing," the new king took a breath, "The storm is approaching."



Whatever he had encountered did not change the fact that the population and location of Border Town meant there was no way out for him—no ports, no fleets, with the Impassable Wilderness at his back, he could only hold out in that corner until he was completely worn down by my relentless offenses.



"Are you insisting on leaving tomorrow?" the knight asked worriedly.



"If we stop at every rain, how will we ever face the real storm?" Timothy turned around and said. Sooner or later, Roland Wimbledon would kneel and beg for forgiveness at his feet, and the crown of the King of Greycastle would surely sit firmly on his own head. But these were just the beginning. The movements and intentions of the Church were becoming clearer and clearer. One day, Greycastle would have to contend with the Church, and that would be the real challenge. "Go attend to your duties. The sooner you complete the task I've given you, the sooner you can return to the capital."



"As you command, Your Majesty."



Ed stepped out, then turned back to ask, "I almost forgot, what about those who took the pills and didn't die on the battlefield? This is their third time taking the medicine."



"Let them be incinerated along with Clearwater Harbor," he replied expressionlessly.



The knight took his leave, and Timothy suddenly felt a coolness at the tip of his nose. He looked up to see rain falling from the clouds, starting with a few sparse drops, then becoming denser and denser, quickly causing ripples on the surface of the sea.

...

At the top of the Tower of Babel in the new Holy City of Hermes.



"Damn it, damn it to hell!" Tefren slammed the table fiercely, "That son of a bitch! That blasphemer! How dare she point her spear at the Church!?"



Maine had never seen the old Archbishop lose his composure like this before. The veins on his forehead bulged, his beard quivered with rage, and his face was so twisted it looked as if he wanted to devour his opponent whole.

It was hard to imagine that normally, he would complain incessantly about Heather, and they could argue for an entire afternoon after just a few words of disagreement. But when he saw the jewelry box sent by Queen Clearwater, the old man erupted in astonishing fury.

The jewelry box did not contain pearls, only an iron ring—a bishop's insignia personally bestowed by the Pope, with the ring placed on a bloodstained severed finger.

Maine sighed, reached out to close the jewelry box, and said, "Of course she dares, because we have not received the blessing of the divine—the gods... only favor the victors."

These words instantly calmed Tavore down. He sat back in his chair without a word, taking deep breaths, before finally managing to force out, "What do you plan to do next?"

Indeed, this was a situation that the Church had not encountered in nearly a century. No one expected Grace to travel from Greycastle to Everwinter, capture the capital, and then dispatch the Black Sail Fleet to approach Hermes. Even though Wolfheart was on the brink of being conquered, Maine did not hesitate to call back the God's Punishment Army to the old Holy City.

This city, without walls, was the barrier of the Hermes mechanism and must not be lost under any circumstances.

After the offensive ceased, the Black Sail Fleet did not continue to advance but instead returned to the capital along the river—clearly, the enemy's intentions were obvious. If the Church deployed a large army to attack Wolfheart, Grace would attack the Holy City by water. This sudden interference from the royal power had the nobles of Everwinter stirring again. Maine believed that as long as these greedy individuals could continue to hold onto their lands and wealth, they would not hesitate to support Grace as the new Queen of Everwinter.

The current predicament was no longer something he could easily resolve.



But the Church would not be defeated by such difficulties. Long before he became a bishop, he understood that the path he was to walk was a thorny one.

"First of all, the Holy City needs to appoint a new bishop. You should compile a list of candidates, and the final decision will be made by the Pope," Mayne said slowly.

"What about the enemy?" Tav asked, snorting through his nose.

"I will explain everything to the Pope, don't worry," he closed his eyes, "His Holiness has his own divine judgment."
