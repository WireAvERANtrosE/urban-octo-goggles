## Unexpected Surprise
May had not expected that when she once again embarked on the journey back to Border Town, her heart would be filled with anticipation.



The woods along the bank of Redwater River had started to turn yellow, and the breeze that blew in her face brought a hint of coolness. The river, shimmering with waves, churned underfoot, and occasionally, falling leaves could be seen gliding past the side of the boat.



Without the previous anxiety and unease, the autumn scenery around her took on a poetic and picturesque charm.



"Miss May," a respectful voice came from behind her, "was the play 'Diary of a Witch' really written for you by His Highness the Prince himself?"



May turned around and saw a group of actresses gathering around, with the one at the forefront looking at her nervously. She remembered that the woman seemed to be called Swallow.



"Ah ha, sorry," Irene waved at her from the bow of the boat, shouting with a smile, "I couldn't answer their question, so I had to let them come and ask you."



That dummy... May rolled her eyes secretly. In the past, she would have just scoffed coldly. Probably because she had spent a lot of time with Irene, her patience had actually grown longer, "It wasn't written for me by His Highness, but by the Minister of Education from the City Hall, Sir Barov, for the witches."



"Uh, is that so?" Swallow blinked, "When you were arguing with Bella, we all thought it was true."



'The difference between 'personally written by His Highness' and 'personally written for me by His Highness' is huge. How on earth did they hear the former as the latter? "But the scriptwriting and the play's performance were both approved by His Highness the Prince, so when Bella mocked the script, she was indeed mocking His Highness himself. On that point, I certainly didn't bluff her."



"Have you seen His Highness the Prince?" 

"I heard he has the distinctive gray hair of the royal family, a handsome appearance, extraordinary indeed, is that true?"

"I also heard he is quite the playboy, with numerous lovers!"

"Eh, is that so?"

"..." Watching the lively group of young girls, May couldn't help but frown, darn it, she should not have indulged their curiosity. 

"Alright, stop bothering Miss May," Lorgar stepped forward to shoo them away, giving May an apologetic look.

"It's fine," she shrugged, continuing to enjoy the scenery along the coast, "after all, this is trouble I brought upon myself."

"I... don't quite understand," Lorgar scratched her head, "why did you bring them with you when you left? Out of the thirty-five people, only two have been on stage, and twenty-six haven’t even finished all the courses in the drama class. According to what you said before, they're not even fledglings, still in their eggs, not yet hatched... Even if Lord Roland doesn't have high requirements for the theater, it's doubtful these people would be acceptable to him. If you wanted to get back at Bella, you should have wooed those experienced supporting actors."

"I’m not planning to have all of them act."



"Ah?" The other party was momentarily stunned.



"They can all understand the script, right?" May smiled, "Although they are still a long way from performing on stage, at the very least they can read and write. Haven't you noticed? His Highness needs such talents the most right now." She paused for a moment, "Do you really think Prince Roland Wimbledon recruited us just because he likes drama?"



"This..."



"If it were Lord Peter, then the answer would definitely be yes. Even before he took over Longsong Stronghold, he had the habit of visiting the theater once a week. But as for Prince Roland, aside from the premiere of a new play, he's never seen at the town square at other times—so his promotion of drama is not out of personal fondness, but rather he plans to use it to spread his views to the masses." May continued, "Compared to the initial emphasis on resisting oppression and that witches are not evil, the new scripts 'Dawn' and 'New City' have shifted towards goals like recruiting population and encouraging hard work and riches. I'm just following his intentions and offering a little help."



"I, I never thought about that..." Rosia was astonished.



"To ponder over a script, aside from immersing oneself in the role, one must also grasp the entire story's intended message, which is also a quality that a good actor must possess."



"Yes, thank you for your guidance!" She bowed.



"Don't worry," May's lips curled up, "If you no longer wish to act, you can still find a decent job in Border Town. You might even enter the City Hall and become an administrative officer. After all, His Highness doesn't require a background, nor does he look at family history. This path is much easier than becoming an actor."



...



Upon the ship's arrival in the town, May immediately noticed Philip Hilt, who had come to the dock to greet them.

Of course, he was there for Irene.

Seeing the girl sprint into his embrace, she sighed softly.

"Isn't that the Morning Light?"

"So he wasn't exiled by His Highness after all."

"The number one knight of the Western Region, how nice," Swallow said enviously, "I thought he would be with the Star of the Theater—"

"What nonsense are you talking about?" May's sharp reprimand made everyone immediately zip their lips, "Hurry up and take your luggage off the ship. Gait and Rosia will take you to the city hall to register your identities. For the rest, just follow their arrangements."

"Yes," everyone answered respectfully.

Walking down the dock, Philip came over with his wife and gave her a bow with his hand on his chest, "Miss May, Irene has just informed me about the conflict at the theater, thank you for your kindness towards her."



"No need to thank me," May said nonchalantly. "It looked like they were causing trouble for her, but in reality, they were targeting me."



"Even so, I still want to thank you," the knight said with a hearty laugh. "If it weren't for you, she would have definitely burst into tears right then and there."



After the two left, May pursed her lips, hoisted her luggage on her back, and headed towards the residential district.



Though she had let go of those feelings, the sight still stirred some emotions within her. And that familiar figure didn't show up, especially after having promised in his letter to give her a surprise.



Well, after all, he's an important person by His Highness's side. He probably can't move around as freely as the Dawn Light, right?



Back home, May set down her package, and a long-missed sense of relaxation washed over her. She took a deep breath and reached into the cabinet for some white liquor, just as she was about to have a drink, there was a knock at the door.



Opening it, she was surprised to find Carter Lannis standing outside.



"I didn't expect you to arrive a half hour early," he said, wiping the sweat from his forehead. "I heard that the ship from Longsong Stronghold had already arrived, so I rushed over from the barracks."



For some reason, even though she hadn't seen him at the docks and he hadn't come to pick her up, seeing him brightened May's mood instantly. "Would you like to come in for a drink?"



"No, I have a task this afternoon," Carter waved his hand.



"Um," she nodded, "the matters entrusted by His Highness are indeed more important."



"I came to give you a gift." The Chief Knight took out a white wooden box from his pocket and handed it to her.



"Is this the latest commodity from the Convenience Market?" May curiously took the wooden box, opened the lid, and saw a golden-orange ring quietly standing at the bottom of the box. Its top was inlaid with a brilliant transparent gemstone, which refracted a rainbow of light in the autumn sunlight shining through the window.



Without a doubt, the ring was valuable and unlikely to be an item sold at the Convenience Market. Moreover, a noble gifting a ring signified... she couldn't help but cover her mouth.



"Miss May, would you marry me?" Carter asked earnestly.
