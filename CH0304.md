## Unexpected Surprise
May didn't expect that when she once again set off on her journey back to Border Town, her heart would be filled with anticipation. The woods along the bank of the Redwater River had begun to turn yellow, and the breeze that met her face carried a hint of coolness. The river water, shimmering with waves, rolled beneath her feet, and from time to time, fallen leaves could be seen sliding past the side of the boat.



Gone was the previous anxiety and unease, and the surrounding autumn scenery also took on a poetic and picturesque charm.



"Miss May," a respectful voice came from behind her, "was the script for 'The Witch Diaries' that you performed truly written by His Highness for you?"



May turned around, only to see a group of actresses gathering around her, the one leading them looking at her nervously. She remembered that her name seemed to be Swallow.



"Ah ha, sorry," Irene waved at her from the bow of the boat, laughing loudly, "I couldn't answer their question, so I had to let them come to you."



That idiot... May rolled her eyes secretly. If it had been before, she would have just thrown a couple of cold laughs in response. Maybe it was because she had spent so much time with Irene, but her patience seemed to be growing day by day. "It wasn't written by His Highness for me, but by the Minister of Education from the City Hall, Sir Scroll, for the witches."



"Eh, is that so?" Swallow blinked, "When you were arguing with Bella, we all thought it was for real."



'The script written by His Highness' and 'The script written by His Highness for me,' the difference between the two was huge. How on earth did they hear the first half as the latter half? "However, both the scriptwriting and the play's performance were approved by His Highness, so Bella's ridicule of the script is indeed the same as ridiculing His Highness himself. On that point, I certainly didn't bluff her."



"Have you met His Highness the Prince?"

"I heard he has the royal family's signature long grey hair, and he's exceptionally handsome. Is it true?"

"I also heard that he's quite the ladies' man with numerous lovers!"

"Eh, is that really the case?"

"..." Watching the lively group of young girls, May couldn't help but frown. Damn it, she shouldn't have indulged their curiosity in the first place.

"Alright, let's not bother Miss May anymore." RoSha stepped forward to shoo them away, giving May an apologetic look.

"It's fine," she shrugged and continued to enjoy the scenery along the coast. "After all, I brought this trouble on myself."

"I... don't quite understand," RoSha scratched her head, "why did you choose to take them with you? Out of the thirty-five, only two have ever been on stage, and twenty-six haven't even finished all the classes of the drama course. According to what you've said before, they're not even fledglings, still in their shells, not yet hatched... Even if Lord Barov isn't very demanding about plays, these people will probably hardly be accepted by him. If you're trying to get back at Bella, you should have sided with those experienced supporting actors."

"I didn't plan for all of them to act."



"Ah?" The other party was momentarily stunned on the spot.



"They can all understand the script, right?" May smiled, "Although there is still a long way to go before they can perform on stage, at least they can read and write. Haven't you noticed? His Highness needs such talents the most right now." She paused for a moment, "Do you really think His Highness Roland Wimbledon recruited us to perform because he enjoys drama?"



"This..."



"If it were Lord Petrov, the answer would definitely be yes. He had the habit of visiting the theater once a week before he took over the Longsong Stronghold. But as for His Highness Roland, apart from the premiere of new plays, he would not appear in the town square at other times—so his promotion of drama is not because of his personal taste, but rather he plans to use drama to propagate his views to the masses," May continued, "Compared to the initial emphasis on resisting oppression and that witches are not evil, the new scripts 'Dawn' and 'New City' have shifted towards goals like recruiting population and encouraging hard work to become wealthy. I'm just following his intentions and contributing a little effort."



"I... I never thought about these things..." Roach was astonished.



"To ponder a script, besides putting oneself in the character's shoes, one must also grasp the entire story's intended message. This is a quality that an excellent actor must possess."



"Yes, thank you for your guidance!" she bowed deeply.



"Don't worry," May quirked a corner of her mouth, "If you don't want to act anymore, you can also find a good job in Border Town. Maybe you could even enter the City Hall and become an administrative officer. After all, His Highness does not require a background, nor does he consider one's family history. This path is much easier than becoming an actor."

...



The ship arrived at the town, and May immediately spotted Flynn Silt waiting at the dockside to greet them.

Of course, he was there for Irene.

She sighed softly as she saw the girl dash into his embrace.

"Isn't that the Dawnlight?"

"It turns out His Highness didn't sentence him to exile."

"The first knight of the Western Region, yeah? How nice," Swallow said enviously, "I thought he would be with the Star of the Theater—"

"What nonsense are you talking about," May's cold rebuke silenced everyone, "Hurry up and take your luggage off the ship. Gait and Rother will take you to the Town Hall to register your identities, and for everything else, just follow their arrangements."

"Yes," everyone answered respectfully.

Walking down the dock, Flynn, accompanied by his wife, approached her and gave a chest salute, "Miss May, Irene just told me about the conflict in the theater. Thank you for your care for her."



"No need for thanks," Mei said indifferently, "It seemed like they were looking for trouble with her, but in reality, they were targeting me."



"Even so, I still want to thank you," the knight said with a hearty laugh. "If it weren't for you, she would have definitely burst into tears on the spot."



After the two left, Mei curled her lips, shouldered her luggage alone, and headed towards the residential district.



Although she had let go of those feelings, she still felt a pang of emotion at the scene, and that familiar figure had not appeared, especially after having promised in his letter to give her a surprise.



Well, after all, he is an important person by His Highness's side, and he probably can't move around as freely as the Dawn Light, right?



Back home, Mei set down her bags and was greeted by a long-missed sense of relaxation. She took a deep breath, pulled out some white liquor from the cabinet, and was about to have a drink when there was a knock on the door.



Opening the door, the person standing outside was none other than Carter Lannis.



"I didn't expect you to arrive half an hour early," he said, wiping the sweat from his forehead. "I heard that the ship from Longsong Fortress had already arrived, so I hurried over from the barracks."



For some reason, even though she hadn't seen him at the docks, even though he hadn't come to pick her up, seeing him lifted Mei's spirits instantly, "Would you like to come in for a drink?"



"No, I have a task this afternoon," Carter waved his hand.

"Um," she nodded, "the task given by His Highness is more important."

"I came to give you a gift." The Chief Knight took out a small white wooden box from his pocket and handed it to her.

"Is this the latest product from the Convenience Market?" May curiously took the wooden box, opened the lid, and saw a golden orange ring quietly standing at the bottom of the box. Its top was inlaid with a dazzling clear gemstone that refracted a rainbow of light under the autumn sunlight filtering through the window.

Without a doubt, the ring was valuable and unlikely to be merchandise from the Convenience Market. Moreover, a noble giving a ring signified... She couldn't help but cover her mouth.

"Miss May, would you marry me?" Carter asked earnestly.
