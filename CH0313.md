## Battle of Souls
It has been a long time since I felt such warm sunlight.

Grace stood in the garden and took a deep breath, the scent of rosemary drifting into her nostrils with the breeze.

This is not the Kingdom of Everwinter, where nothing exists but cold wind, frozen soil, and odorless winter flowers. The backyard of the castle was always hung with meat and intestines left to dry, with a strong stench that lingered. Nor is this Clearwater Harbor, where the familiar salty smell and humidity in the wind are absent, and closing one's eyes does not bring the sound of waves rushing onto the beach.

This is the royal palace of Greycastle, she thought.

But... it was somewhat different from what she remembered.

Grace sat down by the central flower pond, touching the slightly rough stone bricks—since she fell while playing hide and seek here as a child, hitting her forehead hard against the edge of the pond and her face covered with blood, her father had all the stone bricks knocked off and replaced with smooth pebbles. This way, although it would no longer cause people to trip and injure themselves, it could no longer serve as a hiding spot either.

At that time, she remembered that besides herself, Herman and Timothy were also present. Seeing their sister fall, they were all terribly frightened; to make her stop crying, they even took turns imitating her fall, deliberately bumping their heads on the edge of the pond. Of course, they also got a good beating from their father afterwards.

It was a piece of Grace's past that she thought she would never reminisce, like a secret buried under a tree, deeply hidden away. But now that she had returned to the old place, she found that the scene had not faded at all; unearthing it from the soil, it was still vivid.

Everything seemed to have gone back to her childhood days.



"So this is your world," a strange voice arose from behind, "As a resting place, it's a decent choice."

Grace turned around, only to see a woman in white emerging from behind a flower bed. She had pale red pupils and snow-white long hair, her features as exquisitely carved as if by a sculptor's hand. Her voice was ethereal and pleasing to the ear, like a messenger from the heavens descended to the mortal realm.

Queen Clearwater's face darkened completely, "You're a witch from the Church."

"My name is Jiera, and the term witch does not suit me," she said with a light laugh. "I am known as the Purifier, unlike those fallen bloodlines."

"Purifier? Nothing but a pet kept by the Church," Grace said coldly, "And what is this scene? Some kind of trick? Is your ability to create illusions?" Suddenly, she picked up a stone and squeezed it hard in her hand, "It's all but an illusion! You can't deceive me!"

The queen’s roar echoed far into the distance, but the scene before her remained unchanged, and the stone did not shatter in response. Instead, its hard edges cut through her skin. Opening her hand, the abraded wound throbbed with pain, clear and real.

"I can see that you're not completely ignorant of witch powers, which makes things much easier," Jiera said as she lifted the hem of her dress and curtsied slightly, "Welcome to the world of consciousness. I call it the Soul Battlefield. Here we shall fight, and the victor takes all while the loser loses everything... just as the divine prophecies recorded in the Holy Scriptures."

Soul... Battlefield?

Grace was taken aback, suddenly feeling a heart-wrenching pain emanating from her chest as Jiera, seemingly out of nowhere, drew a long spear and thrust it directly into her front. Breathing became difficult all at once, and as she opened her mouth to scream, no sound came out. The other twisted the spear and pulled it out with a fierce yank, blood spurting from the tip, quickly soaking half of her body. Grace fell to her knees, trembling as she tried to cover the wound, the profuse loss of blood causing her consciousness to blur.



The next moment, she found herself still standing in place, unharmed. The shadow stood a few meters away from her as if it had never moved from there.

What's happening? Grace panted heavily, an illusion? She clutched her violently heaving chest, the place where she had been pierced still ached faintly. Looking down, there was a large pool of blood spread out in a spray pattern beneath her feet.

"This is the basic rule. Consciousness is not immortal," Zero spread her hands, "The pain brought by each death is real to you. It will consume your spirit and strength, and when this sensation exceeds what you can bear, true eternal slumber will come."

"With each death, the original state is restored. Most people can endure only three to four times, of course, I've also seen many with strong wills, who can endure seven or eight times, or even more." She explained gently, "Although I look forward to your performance, I can understand if you choose to give up resistance, after all, consecutive deaths are an unbearable torment for me as well. Choosing to flee is not an act of cowardice in such times, especially when the outcome is already determined."

Having said that, she dropped the spear in her hand, and from behind her back drew forth a great sword, leaping straight up to slash at Grace.

The latter's eyes widened, the Pure Witch wore a white robe, it was impossible to hide such a huge weapon, those weapons were... conjured out of thin air? Suddenly, the opponent's words flashed through her mind—

"So this is your world..."

"I call it the soul battlefield."

"Consciousness is not immortal... It is real to you."



The greatsword came slashing down, not splitting Queen Clearwater in two, but instead striking a large iron shield. The huge rebound force caused Jeryl to lose her grip on the hilt of the sword. The greatsword flew up with a clang, and her body was forced to retreat several steps. Grace also fell to the ground due to the heavy and powerful chop.



"Is the outcome predestined?" She gritted her teeth and chuckled coldly, "You said before that this is 'my world,' right?" As she spoke, she got up from the ground, suddenly producing a hand crossbow, and shot at the other party. At the same time, a cross rose behind Jeryl, firmly trapping her body.



The bolt instantly buried itself into the Pure Witch's abdomen, causing her to show an expression of pain. After gasping twice, she slowly began to speak, "I'm... surprised... *cough* *cough*... If it were an ordinary person... just accepting all this would be difficult, let alone mobilizing consciousness to counterattack. You truly are... the Clearwater Queen who gives Lord Mayne such a headache."



"Thanks for the compliment," Grace replied as she picked up the long spear that had fallen on the ground, "If you hadn't talked so much, I wouldn't have been able to understand the wonders of the conscious world so quickly. Next, where should I put a few more holes in you?"



She smiled painfully, "As you wish."



...



When Grace thrust the tenth spear, the Pure Witch finally died—she deliberately avoided the fatal spots, starting with the limbs and abdomen. In the beginning, Jeryl would let out screams of unbearable pain, but later her voice gradually grew weaker.



She should be back to normal after this, right? But this is the royal palace of Greycastle, her own home ground. Since she can change the environment and objects at will, she couldn't possibly lose.



Sure enough, a flash of white light passed over the Pure Witch, and the wounds disappeared in the blink of an eye. Jeryl opened her light red eyes once again.



Grace lifted her spear, ready to send her to death, when a sudden change occurred—the hands that were bound by the cross easily broke free from the ropes, kicked away the spear, and in a flash, she was up close, raising her arm in a slanting strike. Grace didn't even have time to react before she lost all sensation in her body.

The headless corpse collapsed with a thud, while the other's hands were empty.

How—how is this possible?

A few breaths later, Queen Clearwater covered her own neck, stepping back in disbelief and uncertainty... Just now, had she severed her own neck with her arm? Looking at the broken hemp rope on the cross and the fresh blood on her hand, it was clear that the previous scene was no illusion.

"If you cannot comprehend the essence of consciousness, how could I welcome a true battle?" Jaelor smiled and said, "Besides, you seem quite perplexed as to how I could break free from rope as thick as fingers? This is not hard to understand, the victor takes all, the loser loses everything... Among those I have devoured, there is a type of witch who is exceptionally powerful, possessing boundless strength, agility, and not fearing the influence of the Divine Stone of Judgement. You might not be fully aware, but the Church has a special term for them—Transcendents."

She spread her hands. "You cannot defeat me with conventional means. If you want to survive, you will have to try much harder... Now, it's my turn."
