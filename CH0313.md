## Battle of Souls
It had been a long time since she had felt such warm sunlight.



Grace stood in the garden, taking a deep breath, and the scent of rosemary wafted into her nostrils with the breeze.



This was not the Kingdom of Everwinter, where nothing existed but the cold winds, frozen ground, and winter flowers devoid of fragrance. The backyard of the castle was always hung with slabs of meat and fat intestines to dry, and the strong stench of blood was inescapable. This place was also not Clearwater Harbor, where the familiar salty smell and humidity were absent in the wind, and closing her eyes, she could not hear the sound of the seawater rushing up onto the beach.



This was the palace of Greycastle, she thought.



But... it was somewhat different from what she remembered.



Grace sat down by the central flower pond, touching the slightly rough stone bricks—ever since she had fallen and hit her forehead on the edge of the flower pond while playing hide and seek as a child, bleeding all over her face, her father had knocked off all the stone bricks and replaced them with smooth cobblestones. This way, although it would no longer trip and hurt anyone, it could no longer serve as a hiding spot either.



At that time, besides herself, Herman and Timothy were also present. Seeing their sister fall, they were frightened and, to stop her from crying, even imitated how she had fallen, deliberately bumping their heads on the edge of the pond. Of course, they got a severe beating from their father afterward.



That was a piece of the past Grace thought she would never reminisce, like a secret buried beneath a tree, deeply hidden away. But when she returned to the old place, she found that these scenes had not faded at all; once dug out from the earth, they were still vivid.



Everything seemed to have returned to her childhood days.



"So this is your world," a strange voice sounded from behind. "As a resting place, it's actually quite nice."



Grace turned around and saw a woman in white emerging from behind the flower pool. She had a pair of light red pupils and snow-white long hair. Her features were delicately carved, and her voice was ethereal and pleasant, like an angel descending to the mortal world.



Queen Clearwater's face darkened completely, "You're a witch of the Church."



"My name is Zero, and the term 'witch' isn't quite suitable for me," she said with a light laugh. "I am known as a Pure Witch, different from those who have fallen."



"Pure Witch? Nothing but a plaything kept by the Church," Grace said coldly. "What is this charade? Is your ability to create illusions?" She suddenly picked up a stone and squeezed it hard in her hand. "It's all an illusion! You can't fool me!"



The queen's shout echoed far and wide, but the scene before her eyes did not change at all, and the stone did not shatter in response. Instead, the sharp edges cut her skin. As she opened her hand, the abraded wound throbbed with pain, clear and real.



"It's clear that you're not completely ignorant about witches' powers, which will make things easier," Zero said as she lifted the hem of her dress, bowing slightly. "Welcome to the world of consciousness, which I call the Soul Battlefield. We will fight here, with the victor gaining everything and the loser losing everything... just as the divine revelation recorded in the holy book."



Soul... Battlefield?



Grace was momentarily stunned, then suddenly felt an excruciating pain in her chest as Zero drew a long spear from nowhere and thrust it directly into her front. Breathing suddenly became difficult; she opened her mouth to shout but could not make a sound. The other party twisted the spear, and with a fierce pull, blood spurted out along the tip of the spear, quickly soaking half her body. Grace fell to her knees, trembling as she tried to cover the wound, and the massive blood loss caused her consciousness to blur gradually.



The next moment, she found herself still standing in the original spot, completely unharmed. And the shadow stood a few meters away from her, as if it had never left that spot.



What's going on? Grace gasped for air, an illusion? She clutched at her violently heaving chest, the spot where she had been pierced still throbbed with pain. Lowering her head, she saw a large pool of blood scattered in a spray pattern beneath her feet.



"This is the basic rule. Consciousness is not immortal," Jeluo spread her hands, "The pain brought about by each death is real to you. It will consume your spirit and strength, and when this feeling exceeds the range you can bear, true eternal sleep will come."



"With each death, the original state is restored. Ordinary people can withstand it at most three or four times. Of course, I have also seen many with firm wills who can endure seven or eight times, or even more," she explained gently, "Although I look forward to your performance, if you choose to give up resistance, I can understand. After all, continuous death is also an unbearable torture for me. Choosing to escape is not a cowardly act, especially when the outcome is already determined."



Having said that, she tossed aside the spear in her hand and once again pulled out a great sword from behind her back, leaping straight up and slashing toward Grace.



The latter's eyes widened; the Pure Witch was clad in a white robe and couldn't possibly hide such a huge weapon. Those weapons were... conjured out of thin air? Suddenly, the words of the other flashed through her mind—



"So this is your world..."



"I call it the Soul Battlefield."



"Consciousness is not immortal... It is real to you."



The great sword fell, not splitting the Clearwater Queen in two, but instead, it hit a large iron shield. The immense rebound made Jiera unable to hold onto the hilt. The great sword flew up with a clang, and her body staggered back several steps. Grace also fell to the ground due to the heavy and powerful slash.



"Is the outcome predestined?" She sneered with clenched teeth. "You said before that this is 'my world,' right?" As she spoke, she flipped over to get up, and suddenly, a hand crossbow appeared in her hand, which she raised and shot at the other party. At the same time, a cross rose behind Jiera, firmly trapping her body.



The crossbow bolt instantly penetrated the Pure Witch's abdomen, and she immediately showed a pained expression. After gasping twice, she slowly began to speak, "You... you surprise me... *cough cough*... If it were an ordinary person... just accepting all this would be difficult, let alone mobilizing consciousness to counterattack. You are indeed... the Clearwater Queen who has given Lord Mayne so much trouble."



"Thanks for the compliment," Grace picked up the long spear that had fallen to the ground. "If you hadn't talked so much, I wouldn't have been able to grasp the wonders of the consciousness world so quickly. Next, how many holes should I poke in you?"



She smiled with difficulty, "Do as you please."



...



When Grace thrust the tenth spear, the Pure Witch finally died—she deliberately avoided the fatal spots, starting from the limbs and the abdomen. At first, Jiera would let out unbearable screams of pain, but later her voice gradually grew weaker.



Next, this guy should return to normal, right? But this is the royal palace of Greycastle, her home ground; since she can change the environment and objects at will, she couldn't possibly lose.



As expected, a white light flashed over the Pure Witch's body, the wounds disappeared in the blink of an eye, and Jiera once again opened her pale red eyes.



Grace raised her long spear, ready to send her to death, when a sudden change occurred—she saw her hands bound by the cross easily break free from the ropes, kick away the spear shaft, and instantly close in on herself, swinging her hand at an angle. Grace had no time to react and had already lost all sensation in her body.



The headless corpse fell to the ground with a thud, while the opponent's hands were empty.



How could this be?



A few breaths later, Queen Clearwater covered her own neck, taking two uncertain steps back... Just now, did she sever her own neck with her arm? Looking at the broken hemp rope on the cross and the fresh blood on her hands, clearly, the scene before was not an illusion.



"If you cannot comprehend the essence of consciousness, how could I have a true battle?" Jaelor smiled and said, "Also, you seem to be wondering why I could break free from ropes as thick as fingers? This is not hard to understand, the victor takes all, the loser loses everything... Among those I have devoured, there is a type of witch who is exceptionally powerful, with boundless strength, agility, and unaffected by the God's Punishment Stones. You might not be clear, but the church has a special term for them—Transcendents."



She spread her arms, "You cannot defeat me with conventional means, to survive, you'll have to work doubly hard... Now, it's my turn."
