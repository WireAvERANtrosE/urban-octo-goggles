## The War of Mortals (Part 2)
Mortals cannot defeat devils, Isabella thought, which is why the church has the God's Punishment Army.

They are immensely strong, without pain, and without fear, the best weapon against devils. Although they lack the ability to act independently, this may not necessarily be a disadvantage during marching and combat.

Such formidable power is naturally not something that the ordinary garrison could withstand.

Especially without the support of the city walls, the idea of defeating these church elites in close combat is nothing but a fantasy.

The golden torrent is the Judgment Army; the main force burst through the main gate of Wolfheart City, clashing with the gathered garrison. And the red embellishments were the God's Punishment Army; they effortlessly scaled the collapsed walls and began to slaughter those enemies trying to stabilize their ranks.

"Should we go and lend them a hand?" she turned her head to look at Gerald.

The latter yawned, "No, my magic is limited, I must save it for important targets."

"You can join the battle with a sword, a hammer, or a crossbow," Isabella pouted, "After all, they can't possibly defeat you."

Gerald shook her head, "If I go, they can easily win; if I don't go, they can just as easily win. I don't want to do such meaningless things."



"Alright," she changed the subject, "why did you do that before?"

"What do you mean?"

"Playing with that captive. The face of His Excellency the Bishop was stiff," Isabella expressed her concern, "It seems he doesn't like such a trial. Moreover, the next Pope is likely to be him, you might suffer for it."

"Lord Mayne will be angry because he is not yet the Pope," Agatha said indifferently, "Once he enters the top floor of the Secret Archive of the Holy See, he will naturally understand, this is the way to please the deities."

"What... way?"

"To play," the Pure Witch smoothed her wind-blown snowy white hair, "The deities have never descended to the world, nor do they protect the people. They use an elusive goal to make us fall over each other in pursuit, longing for their grace. Isn't that similar to the trial just now? At least I gave him a clear goal, but the deities have given us nothing. They haven't even guaranteed that the goal truly exists, or rather, everything we believe might be nothing but delusions we've conjured ourselves. Yet still, we throw ourselves into the fray... tsk tsk, that is the most thorough form of toying."

What on earth is she talking about, why can't I understand a word? Isabella frowned, "You've been to the Archive?"

"No," she shrugged, "These are all things His Highness Oberlein said to me. He is not a witch, his life is nearing its end, and it's said that when a mortal's time comes, they relive the scenes of their life and can't help but want to share it with someone. He even planned to let me devour him before he dies."

"You can't—"



"Of course I can't, that would infuriate Lord Maine," Jelo interrupted, "Don't worry, I know what shouldn't be done." She smiled mysteriously, "And there's another possibility. What if I lose? Wouldn't I be giving my body away for free?"

"I don't think so. If you lose, most likely nothing will happen." Isabella sighed. This person was strange, probably related to her ability—after having engulfed so many people, there were hardly any sensations she hadn't experienced. Thus, Jelo rarely took a keen interest in anything; whatever she did was for amusement, and it had to be an unusual kind of fun.

Isabella turned her gaze back to the battlefield. Suddenly, a group of desperados appeared on the city wall. They charged towards the God's Punishment Army, most of them impaled by whistling spears as they got close, but a few slipped through to the God's Punishment Army. Then an explosion sounded, and the rising smoke obscured the breach in the city wall.

This must be the alchemical weapon that appeared in the last siege, she thought. The power seemed decent, a good choice to contain the demonic beasts. But against the God's Punishment Army, it was tantamount to suicide. Without the pills, they wouldn't even dream of getting close to a God's Punishment Warrior.

On the other side, the flow of the golden ocean also slowed down. Suddenly, a raging fire burst forth beneath the city gate, cutting off the Judgment Army that had not yet entered the city. Some men caught in the flames could not put them out, even when rolling on the ground.

"Hmm... The density of the Divine Stone of Judgement behind the door has increased several times, and there are two of higher quality. It seems that some big shots have arrived," Isabella said.

"In that case, let's make our move," Jelo stretched lazily.

"However, these two are neither the Wolf King nor the Clearwater Queen," she glanced towards the inner city area, "The strongest reaction is still within the castle. Are you sure you want to go?"

"The army is in trouble, isn't it? An easy victory and a costly one are not the same. I need to help His Excellency Oberlain reduce some losses," Jelo said seriously, tilting her head, "As I said before, I am wholeheartedly dedicated to the Church."



As the siege war progressed into the afternoon, the outer defensive line of Wolfheart City finally broke through. After the God's Punishment Warriors took control of the breach, the Judgment Army began to clear out the resistors street by street.

"The target has started moving," Isabella looked towards the castle, "they seem to be heading to the inner river dock."

The two big figures who came to organize the resistance were the sons of the Wolf King, and now both have been swallowed by Zero. Through the prince's intelligence, she further confirmed that the moving God's Stone reaction was indeed the primary target of this mission.

In addition to this, they also killed a fallen witch, who looked and dressed like a person from a different race. After the witch's death, the number of drug-taking militiamen willing to die with the God's Punishment Army was significantly reduced.

"They probably want to escape by boat," Zero smiled, "Let's go and fulfill the mission entrusted by His Majesty."

The other party was obviously very cautious, changing routes several times along the way, and when they reached the dock, they did not board the large ship with the black sails but chose a small, single-masted merchant ship.

However, no matter how they disguised their tracks, their every move was exposed under Isabella's surveillance.

The moment the Wolf King and the Queen of Clearwater boarded the small ship's deck, they were already being encircled from both sides of the dock. Most of the more than twenty people on the ship were personal guards, and even without asking, it was clear that something was amiss. Everyone drew their weapons, leapt from the ship, and charged straight towards the Purifiers.



Sylvie once again displayed her exquisite combat skills. After disarming a personal guard of his longsword barehanded, she fought alongside the others as one. Each of her sword strikes brought someone down, and her steps were light and agile, almost impossible for anyone to predict her next move. Whether it was thrusting, chopping, slashing, or blocking, Sylvie used the most appropriate strength and the trickiest angles to wield her sword. Soon, more than a dozen guards lay on the ground, essentially all felled by a single strike.



The Wolf King drew the sword at his waist, ready for a desperate struggle.



"Isabella!" she called out.



"Got it." The latter immediately activated her ability — a domain of darkness invisible to all but the Eye of Magic. In Isabella's sight, the black forbidden zones formed by different Divine Stones of Judgment were trembling at their own frequencies, like ripples spreading across the surface of water. She controlled her domain to resonate with the same frequency, then connected it with the area of the Divine Stones. The ripples of both instantly neutralized each other, making the domain inside smooth and even.



Sylvie immediately turned into a wisp of ghostly light and entered the body of the Wolf King.



As the Wolf King twisted and transformed into a Pure Witch, Queen Clearwater showed a look of disbelief, "Why can you use abilities in front of the Divine Stone of Judgment?"



"Because the Divine Stone isn't what you think it is..." Isabella followed up by smoothing out the opponent's tremors, "But you don't need to know any of this, because... it's about to end."



Before her voice fell, Sylvie charged again towards Grace of Wimbledon.
