## The War of Mortals (Part 2)
Mortals cannot defeat devils, Isabella thought, which is why the Church has the God's Punishment Army.

They are immensely strong, feel no pain, and know no fear, making them the perfect weapon against devils. Although they lack the ability to act on their own, this is not necessarily a disadvantage during marches and battles.

Such formidable power is naturally not something that a mere human defensive force could withstand.

Especially without the support of city walls, the idea of defeating these elite troops of the Church in close combat was nothing short of a fantasy.

The golden tide was the Judgement Army, with the main force breaking through the main gate of Wolfheart City and clashing with the assembled defensive troops. The red specks were the God's Punishment Army; they effortlessly scaled the collapsed sections of the wall and began to slaughter those trying to stabilize their lines.

"Should we go help them?" she turned her head to look at Agatha.

The latter yawned, "No, my magic power is limited, I must save it for important targets."

"You could join the battle with a sword, a hammer, or a crossbow," Isabella said with a pout, "after all, it's not like they could beat you."

Agatha shook her head, "If I go, they could easily win; if I don't, they can still easily win. I don't want to do such meaningless things."



"Alright," she changed the subject, "why did you do that before?"

"Do what?"

"Toying with that captive, even His Eminence, the Bishop's face was stiff," Isabella said with some worry, "It seems he doesn't like such trials. And since he is likely to be the next Pope, you might suffer for it."

"Lord Mayne will be angry because he is not yet the Pope," said Jolene carelessly, "Once he enters the top floor of the Secret Sanctuary's library, he will naturally understand that this is the way to please the gods."

"What... way?"

"Toying," The Purifier straightened her wind-blown snow-white hair, "The gods have never descended to the world, nor do they protect the people. They only use an elusive goal to make us strive one after another to approach it, hoping to receive their grace. Isn't this similar to the trial just now? I at least gave him a clear goal, but the gods gave nothing. They didn't even guarantee that the goal truly exists, or to say, everything might just be our own fanciful musings. Even so, we still plunge ahead... tsk, tsk, this is the most thorough form of toying."

What on earth is she talking about, why can't I understand a word? Isabella frowned, "Have you been to the library?"

"No," she shrugged, "This is all that His Highness Oberlin told me. He is not a witch, and his life is nearing its end. It is said that when a mortal's time comes, they will revisit the scenes of their life in their mind, and they can't help but want to talk to someone about it. He even planned to let me devour him before he died."

"You can't—"



"Of course I can't, that would infuriate Lord Maine," Gerald interrupted, "Don't worry, I know what not to do." She smiled mysteriously, "There's also a possibility, what if I lose? Wouldn't that mean giving my body to him for nothing?"

"I don't think so. If you lose, it's very likely that nothing will happen," Isabella sighed. This person is strange, probably related to her ability—after having devoured so many people, there are hardly any sensations left in the world that she has not experienced. Therefore, Gerald is seldom keen on anything; everything she does is for amusement, and it must be an unusual kind of fun.

Isabella turned her gaze back to the battlefield. Suddenly, a group of desperadoes appeared at the top of the city walls, charging towards the God's Punishment Army. Most were pierced by whistling spears as they approached, but a few slipped through the net and got close to the God's Punishment Army. Then, explosions sounded, and the rising smoke obscured the breach in the wall.

This must be the alchemical weapon that appeared in the last siege, she thought. It looks powerful and is a good choice for containing demonic beasts. However, using it against the God's Punishment Army is tantamount to suicide. Without the pills, they wouldn't stand a chance of getting close to a God's Punishment Warrior.

On the other side, the flow of the golden ocean also slowed down. Suddenly, a raging fire erupted beneath the city gate, isolating the Judgement Army that had not yet entered the city. Some who were touched by the flames could not extinguish them, even when rolling on the ground.

"Hmm... the density of the God's Stone of Retribution behind the gate has increased several times, and there are two of higher quality. It seems some big shots have arrived," Isabella said.

"If that's the case, then let's enter the fray," Gerald stretched lazily.

"However, these two are neither the Wolf King nor Queen Clearwater," she glanced towards the inner city area, "The strongest reaction is still within the castle. Are you sure you want to go?"

"The army is in trouble, aren't they? An easy victory and a costly victory are not the same thing. I have to help reduce some losses for His Highness Oberlin," Gerald tilted her head and said seriously, "As I said before, I am wholeheartedly devoted to the Church."



...

The siege battle continued until the afternoon when the outer defense line of Wolfheart City finally broke. After the God's Punishment Warriors took control of the breach, the Judgement Army began to clear the resistors street by street.



"The target has started moving," Isabella looked towards the direction of the castle, "It seems they plan to head to the inner river dock."



The two prominent figures who came to organize the resistance were the sons of the Wolf King, and now both had been engulfed by Zero. Using the princes' information, she further confirmed that the moving God's Stone reaction was indeed the biggest target of this mission.



Besides that, they also killed a fallen witch who looked surprisingly like a foreigner in appearance and dress. After the witch died, the number of drug-addled militiamen willing to die with the God's Punishment Army decreased significantly.



"They probably want to escape by boat," Zero said with a smile, "Let's go, to complete the mission entrusted by His Majesty."



The other party was obviously very cautious, changing their routes several times along the way. After arriving at the dock, they did not board the large ship with black sails, but chose a small and nimble single-masted merchant ship.



However, no matter how much they disguised their tracks, their every move was exposed under Isabella's surveillance.



The moment the Wolf King and Queen of Clearwater boarded the deck of the small boat, the two had already encircled from both sides of the dock. Most of the more than twenty people on board were personal guards, and at such a time there wasn't even a need to ask to know something was amiss. Everyone drew their weapons, jumped off the ship, and charged directly at the Purifiers.



Garcia once again demonstrated her exquisite combat skills. After snatching the longsword from a personal guard with her bare hands, she fought fiercely against the crowd. Every strike she made resulted in someone falling, and her footwork was so light and nimble that almost no one could predict her next move. Whether it was thrusting, cleaving, slashing, or blocking, Garcia used the most appropriate strength and the trickiest angles to wield her sword. Soon, more than a dozen personal guards lay on the ground, almost all of them killed with a single strike.



The Wolf King drew the sword at his waist, ready to fight to the death.

"Isabella!" she called out.

"Got it." The latter immediately unfolded her ability—a domain without light that only the Magic Eye could see. In Isabella's vision, the black forbidden zones formed by different God's Punishment Stones were all quivering at their own frequencies, like ripples spreading on the surface of water. She controlled the domain to oscillate at the same frequency, then connected it with the God's Stone areas, instantly neutralizing the ripples, making the domain smooth and even.



Garcia immediately turned into a wisp of ghostly light and entered the body of the Wolf King.

As the Wolf King twisted and transformed into a Pure One, Queen Clearwater showed an incredulous expression, "Why can you use abilities in front of God's Punishment Stones?"

"Because the God's Stones are not what you think they are..." Isabella smoothened out the opponent's tremors, "But you don't need to know that, because... it's going to end soon."

Before her voice fell, Garcia charged again towards Grace Wimbledon.
