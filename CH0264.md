## Bountiful Harvest
The first batch of wheat sown in Border Town finally welcomed its harvest day.

The serfs braved the scorching sun, cutting the wheat stalks with sickles, bundling them up, and transporting them across the river.

Roland knew that the process from wheat ears to wheat grains was a very tedious one. Before the widespread use of mechanical farming tools and combine harvesters, the grains had to be manually separated, cleaned, sifted, and dried. Now, he was witnessing this process once again.

After the wheat stalks were transported back to the camp, the serfs spread them out on the ground to dry. Then, using various tools—whatever was at hand: sticks, stones, rakes—everything was deployed to repeatedly beat the wheat stalks and ears, causing the spikelets to break free from the husks, a process that often lasted three to four days. In Roland's memory, villages would use oxen or donkeys pulling a stone roller around the threshing ground, which was not only less labor-intensive but also produced more even threshing results.

It had to be said that the agricultural level of the town was really too backward.

After threshing came winnowing, again using whatever was available. If there were no forks, sticks would be used as substitutes, or simply using bare hands to grasp the wheat stalks and toss them into the air, as if stir-frying in a pan. After the initial beating, most of the husks of the spikelets were already cracked, and this process was to separate the grains from the ears.

The chaff left after threshing actually had many uses: it could be crushed and returned to the field, used as bedding for livestock, or made into feed and paper. But Roland did not have the time to develop a green industry at the moment, so he could only watch as the serfs piled the chaff by the river and burned it all. Over the next few days, the sky above the town was filled with grey smoke all day long, comparable to the previous cement dust pollution.

At the same time, the two spindle-shaped islands at the Redwater Bridge had also been cleared and were proceeding with the construction of the water-blocking wall as planned. The foundation piers were using the same prefabrication method as the main bridge—first pouring concrete columns containing shaped steel and rebar on the open ground, then carrying out "weight-reduction hoisting," and finally, Lily was responsible for sinking them into the mud, leaving only half a steel plate exposed, waiting to be connected with the bridge body.

Therefore, during this week, Roland essentially shuffled between the Redwater Bridge and the threshing ground, his skin tanned quite a bit by the sun.



After the wheat straw was forked out, only a layer of wheat kernels and husks remained on the threshing floor.

The serfs swept them together, accumulating them into small mounds, then stood atop the mounds and shoveled up the mixture, throwing it toward the open space in front. Since the husks were much lighter than the fruit, they fell to the ground at a greater distance under the breeze, so the wheat kernels fell at their feet, while the empty husks and debris were further away—this was how everyone methodically collected the grain, step by step.

Of course, it was impossible to completely clean out all the husks, and this process would also mix mud and sand into the wheat kernels. Therefore, Roland made up his mind that by the next harvest day, he would definitely prepare a batch of mechanical farming tools in advance—although it was estimated that a combine harvester could not be made, a threshing machine was quite easy to achieve. It was nothing more than changing a stone roller into a millstone and adding a sieve underneath, then using a blower to separate the broken husks.

When the plump wheat kernels were evenly spread out on the threshing floor, it was as if the entire north bank of the Redwater River had been dyed a layer of gold. Looking at these golden fruits, Roland was filled with a sense of achievement. Whether the harvested grain was enough to fill the stomachs of more than ten thousand people or not, at least for Border Town, this was a day worth commemorating.

From this day on, the food in his territory would gradually shift from being completely dependent on imports to self-sufficiency.

After drying for three days, the wheat entered the bagging and weighing stage.

"Your Highness, it's a bumper harvest this time!" That afternoon, Barov ran excitedly into the office, "According to the preliminary statistics from the City Hall, the yield per mu of each responsible farm is at least four times more than in the past, and the highest has reached six times. With this calculation, this year's harvest is enough to fill the stomachs of the people."

"Is that so," Roland couldn't help but laugh, "It seems the newly built granary in the castle district won't have to stay empty after all."

"Do you know what this means?" The expression of the City Hall director looked even more excited than his, "The town only needs to add another two thousand farmers, and it can meet the food consumption of fifty to sixty thousand people! This is simply unbelievable, the town can completely expand into the largest city in Greycastle, no..." he paused, "the grandest city on the continent!"



The main reason why urban populations couldn't grow in this era was due to the low productivity of food, a large city like the King's City with a population of over twenty thousand people already needed dozens of surrounding villages to provide it with food. Each village had about one or two thousand people, and if half of them were engaged in farming, it roughly equated to twenty thousand people supporting another twenty thousand. This meant that the food produced by a single farmer, aside from feeding himself and his family, could at most support one city dweller.



This invisible constraint on productivity is precisely the point, and it's likely hard for Barov to imagine that once mechanized planting becomes widespread, the output of a single person could feed tens of thousands. Border Town achieved such a great harvest without the promotion and development of agricultural technology, and the main credit goes to the modified "Golden One" by Leaf.



Feeding more people with as few farmers as possible, freeing up human resources from the fields and redirecting them into industrial production, was a strategy Roland had established from the beginning. Now that the Ministry of Agriculture has obtained the optimal planting process and with iron farming tools and machinery joining in the cultivation next year, the per capita yield will surely increase.



...

At dusk, Roland held a bonfire speech by the Redwater River—time seemed to have returned to the evening four months ago, with the same blazing bonfire, the dense crowd, and the last glimmer of twilight reflecting on everyone's faces. The only difference was the expressions on each person's face; instead of the panic and unease when they first arrived, now their faces were filled with the joy of a bountiful harvest and an unmistakable sense of anticipation.



Roland gestured downwards with his hand, and the scene immediately quieted down. Everyone held their breath, waiting for the prince to fulfill his promise.



"I know what you all want to hear," he said, not following the usual practice of putting his title and name at the forefront, but speaking directly, "—and I can tell you without a doubt that the promotion rules announced before are still in effect and will continue!"



Just this sentence alone set off the atmosphere on the scene, with people unable to restrain their shouts, and many knelt down, praising the prince's benevolence. "Long live the Lord!" "Long live Prince His Highness!"



"Once the grain tax is weighed and the promotion list will also be announced," Roland continued as the clamor subsided slightly, "the arrangements after becoming freemen will be handled by the City Hall, and you can choose to continue farming or seek other employment in the town."



"Additionally, starting from next year, as long as the harvest meets the promotion criteria set for this time, even if the yield is not among the top, you can still become a freeman. In other words, as long as you work diligently, you will definitely be able to shed the identity of a serf—just as I have said, labor creates wealth, labor changes fate." He paused for a moment, looking around, "I hope that one day in the future, there will not be a single serf in Border Town, and everyone will become a true subject of mine."



As Roland's voice fell, the cheers of the people instantly resounded through the skies above the Redwater River, lasting for a long time.
