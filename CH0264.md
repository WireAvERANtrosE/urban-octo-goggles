## Bountiful Harvest
The first batch of wheat planted in Border Town finally welcomed its harvest day.

The serfs, braving the scorching sun, cut the wheat stalks with sickles, bundling them up and transporting them to the opposite bank of the river.

Roland knew that the process from wheat ears to wheat grains was a very tedious one. Before mechanical farming tools and combine harvesters became widespread, the separation, cleaning, screening, and drying of the wheat grains all needed to be done by hand. Now, he was witnessing this process once again.

After the wheat stalks were brought back to the camp, the serfs spread them out on the ground to dry. Then, using whatever tools were available—sticks, stones, rakes, they repeatedly beat the wheat stalks and ears, making the grain separate from the husk. This process often lasted three to four days. In Roland's memory, in the countryside, oxen or donkeys were used to drag a stone roller back and forth in the threshing ground, not only saving a lot of effort but also producing a more uniform threshing effect than beating.

It had to be said that the agricultural level of the town was really too backward.

After threshing came winnowing, employing whatever was on hand again. Without forks, sticks were used instead, or simply using bare hands to grab the wheat stalks and toss them into the air, just like stir-frying in a wok. After the initial beating, the husks of the grain were mostly broken, and this process helped to separate the fruit from the wheat ears.

The chaff left after threshing actually had many uses: it could be crushed and returned to the field, used as bedding for livestock, or made into feed and paper. But Roland currently had no time to develop green industries, so he could only watch as the serfs piled the chaff by the river and set it all ablaze. Over the next few days, the sky above the town was filled with grey smog all day long, comparable to the previous pollution from cement dust.

Meanwhile, the two spindle-shaped islands at Redwater Bridge had also been cleared and were undergoing the construction of a retaining wall as planned. The foundation piers used the same prefabrication method as the main bridge—casting concrete columns containing shaped steel and rebar on open ground, then performing "weight reduction hoisting," and finally, Lotus was responsible for sinking them into the soil, leaving only half a steel plate exposed, waiting to be connected to the bridge body.

As a result, Roland spent most of the week shuttling between Redwater Bridge and the threshing ground, and his skin had been tanned quite a bit.



After the wheat straw was forked out, only a layer of wheat grains and husks remained on the threshing ground. 

The serfs swept them together into small mounds, then stood atop these mounds and shoveled up the mixture, tossing it toward the open space in front of them. Since the husks were much lighter than the fruits, they would land farther away when blown by the wind, thus the wheat grains fell at their feet, while the husks and chaff were farther away—this was how everyone gradually collected the grains step by step.

Of course, it was impossible to completely clean out the husks, and this process would also cause mud and sandstones to mix into the wheat grains. Therefore, Roland was determined that by the next harvest day, he must prepare a batch of mechanical farming tools in advance—the combine harvester might be unfeasible to make, but a threshing machine was quite easy to achieve, just by replacing the stone roller with a grinding plate, and adding a sieve underneath, then using a blower to separate the broken husks.

When the plump wheat grains were evenly spread out on the threshing ground, it seemed as if the entire northern bank of the Redwater River was dyed with a layer of gold. Looking at these glittering fruits, Roland was filled with a sense of achievement. Regardless of whether the harvested grains were enough to fill the bellies of over ten thousand people, at least for Border Town, this was a day to remember.

From today onward, the food supply in his territory would gradually shift from complete reliance on imports to self-sufficiency.

After drying for three days, the wheat entered the bagging and weighing stage.

"Your Highness, we actually have a great harvest this time!" In the afternoon of that day, Barov ran excitedly into the office, "According to the preliminary statistics of the City Hall, the yield per acre of each duty farm is at least four times more than in the past, and the highest has reached six times. With this calculation, this year's harvest is enough to fill the bellies of the people."

"Is that so," Roland couldn't help but smile, "It seems that the new granary in the castle district won't have to stay empty anymore."

"Do you know what this means?" The expression of the City Hall's supervisor seemed even more excited than him, "With only two thousand more farmers, the town can meet the food consumption of fifty to sixty thousand people! This is simply unbelievable, the town can completely expand into the largest city in Greycastle, no..." he paused, "the grandest city on the continent!"



The main reason why the urban population doesn't increase in this era is due to the low productivity of food. A large city like the capital, with over twenty thousand people, requires food supply from dozens of surrounding villages. Each village has roughly one to two thousand people, and if half of them are engaged in agriculture, it almost equates to twenty thousand people sustaining twenty thousand people. In other words, the food produced by a single farmer, besides supporting themselves and their family, can at most supply one city dweller.



This is the invisible constraint of productivity, and it's difficult for Barov to imagine that once mechanized planting becomes widespread, the output of one person alone could feed tens of thousands. Border Town's bumper harvest, achieved without the promotion and development of agricultural technology, is largely credited to the modified "Golden No. 1" by Leaf.



Feeding more people with as few farmers as possible and liberating manpower from the fields to be invested in industrial production was a strategy that Roland set from the beginning. Now, the Ministry of Agriculture has obtained the optimal planting process, and with iron farming tools and machinery participating in cultivation next year, the per capita yield will inevitably increase.



...



At dusk, Roland held a bonfire speech by the Redwater River—time seemed to have returned to that twilight four months ago, with the same roaring bonfire, the dense crowd, and the last glimmer of twilight reflecting on everyone's faces. The only difference was the expressions on their faces; compared to the initial panic and unease when they first arrived, now their faces were filled with the joy of a bountiful harvest and an uncontrollable anticipation.



Roland gestured downward with his hand, and the scene immediately quieted down. Everyone held their breath, waiting for the prince to fulfill his promise.



"I know what you want to hear," he said, not following the usual custom of placing his title and appellation at the forefront, but instead speaking directly, "—and I can tell you without a doubt that the promotion rules announced before are still in effect and will continue to be so!"



Just this sentence alone ignited the atmosphere at the scene, and the crowd couldn't help but shout out, with many kneeling down, praising the prince's kindness. "Long live our lord!" "Long live His Highness the Prince!"



"As soon as the food is measured and taxes are collected, the promotion list will also be announced," Roland continued as the voices somewhat subsided, "After becoming freemen, the arrangements will be handled by the Town Hall. You can choose to continue farming or seek other jobs in town."



"Additionally, starting from next year, as long as the harvest meets the promotion criteria set this time, even if the yield is not among the top, one can become a freeman. In other words, as long as you work diligently, you will definitely be able to shed the identity of a serf—just as I have said, labor creates wealth, labor changes fate." He paused for a moment, looking around, "I hope that one day in the future, Border Town will no longer have a single serf, and everyone will become my true subjects."



As soon as Roland's words fell, the cheers of the people instantly filled the sky above the Redwater River, and they lasted for a long time.
