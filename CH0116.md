## Battle of Border Town Defense (Part 2)
A knight's charge doesn't reach top speed right from the start; horses have limited stamina and can only maintain high speed for a short time. Typically, they would trot for about one thousand to eight hundred meters, gradually accelerate at five hundred meters, and then start sprinting at the final two hundred meters.



When firing a solid shot, the effective range of the twelve-pound Napoleon cannon could reach thirteen hundred meters. Perhaps due to the short barrel length, Roland's cannons were already inaccurate beyond one kilometer; thus, he had to designate that they only fire within eight hundred meters during training. At this distance, the accuracy of the cannons was guaranteed. Furthermore, the cannonballs would still bounce forward after hitting the ground, causing linear damage, and the likelihood of hitting multiple targets was still quite high.



the Duke of Lion, wanting the mercenaries to go first, ordered the knights to stand by within the acceleration zone—a zone which, under normal circumstances, was absolutely safe from the threats of bows and crossbows, and where knights had enough distance to pick up speed. The low assembly efficiency of the mercenaries caused the knights already in position to pull their mounts to a stop and wait in place. To the artillery unit, they had almost become stationary targets.



The Duke was unaware that as soon as his troops set foot on this land, they had fallen into a battlefield prepared by Roland. The road in the middle was flat and spacious, while the sides were filled with plants catalyzed by leaves, appearing like ordinary grassland. However, beneath the knee-deep weeds, sturdy vines were concealed, acting like tripwires for the horses. If the cavalry wanted to flank the defenses, they could only progress at a very low speed. Within a kilometer range, all distances had been marked by Soraya. Although it might not be clear on the ground, from Lightning's aerial view, the battlefield was precisely segmented into sections, with different color markings representing different distances. The enemy advanced as if on a ruler, and the artillery team no longer needed to calculate the firing angle; they just had to follow the steps predetermined during drills.



Tanner's twelve-pound cannon was the first to roar.



The large amount of gas produced by the gunpowder explosion pushed the cannonball out, and when it exited the muzzle, it had already accelerated to over four hundred meters per second. In almost the time it took for two breaths, the cannonball smashed into the ground with a whistling sound, passing between two knights and landing on the grass beside the road. The splashing mud and stones startled the horses into running, and one rider, unable to react in time, fell from his mount.



The two following cannonballs also missed, kicking up a series of dust clouds.



Of the first volley from the four cannons, only the last group was lucky—the iron ball had no one in front of it initially, but a knight who happened to be controlling his startled mount crossed right in front of it. The armor was as good as nothing in the face of the massive kinetic energy; the iron ball pierced through the thin iron plate along with flesh and blood, then after a slight bounce on the ground, broke the lower leg of another knight. The horse beneath him was also disemboweled, its entrails spilling onto the ground.



If the knights had been in the normal acceleration phase, the next round of cannon fire would have involved adjusting the firing angle first. However, this sudden attack clearly shocked the Duke's allied forces; they didn't even know where the attack came from or by what means—the cannonball's flight speed exceeded the ability of the naked eye to recognize. The knights did not receive an attack command and still lingered in place, trying to calm their restless mounts.



Tanner's team completed the reloading process at the fastest speed, and the second round of shelling began.

The flesh and blood were vulnerable and tender under the firepower, and once grazed by an iron ball, it resulted in an irreversible, severe injury. The knights that were directly hit had their limbs severed into pieces, along with a mist of blood splattering in all directions. Only after the cannonballs hit the ground and the secondary shrapnel formed, could people vaguely see a blurry black ghost, wantonly reaping the lives of comrades among the crowd.

After two rounds of shelling, the Duke finally connected the enemy camp's lights, booming, and inexplicable strikes together. The enemy seemed to possess an incredible weapon, its range far exceeding bows and crossbows, almost comparable to the stronghold's trebuchet. With this in mind, the Duke ordered his men to sound the horn for the attack—once the distance was closed, this long-range strike weapon would essentially lose its effectiveness.

However, the knights showed entirely different reactions. Upon hearing the horn, some began to accelerate towards the town, some still struggled with their mounts, and a few had already retreated backwards. Combined with the rushing mercenaries, the whole scene was in chaos.

The attacking knights returned to the main road, and the gun crew immediately became busy. In addition to cleaning the barrels and loading the ammunition, they also needed to reposition the gun carriages. At this moment, Lightning returned to the airspace above the defense line, her ribbon now changed to red.

The red signal meant that the enemy was within five hundred meters, and at this distance, the direct fire hit rate of the cannons could reach more than eighty percent.

Tanner shouted, "Adjust the firing angle to level! Quick, ignite, ignite!"

After the deafening roar, he didn't even bother to observe the results, immediately turning to yell at the ammunition handlers, "Bring up the canister shot!"

In the cannon operation training, His Highness the Prince had emphasized multiple times that upon seeing the red signal, if the cannon was already loaded with solid shot, they should immediately fire and then load canister shot. If not yet loaded, they should switch to canister shot, and wait for the enemy to enter within three hundred meters before firing.



The buckshot looked like a cylindrical iron tin can on the outside, stuffed with iron pellets the size of a finger and sawdust inside. The diameter of the can was smaller than the bore of the cannon, so after loading the powder charge, an additional thin wooden board had to be stuffed in before the buckshot was filled.



While waiting for Lightning to signal with a purple flair, the four cannons fired almost simultaneously. 



This was also Tanner's first time using buckshot for live-fire shooting—according to His Highness, buckshots were not easy to recover after being fired, so they only practiced the procedure without ignition. Today was his first time witnessing the astonishing lethality of this special type of ammunition. 



The iron canister burst open after flying out of the cannon due to the tremendous pressure difference, and the iron pellets scattered towards the enemy like raindrops, covering the knights within three hundred meters in a metallic downpour. Blood blossomed on the bodies of men and horses, and they fell in an instant like wheat being harvested. Some of the pellets still retained significant kinetic energy after penetrating human bodies, and stacked targets could not escape the same fate. 



The knights fortunate enough not to be covered by the barrage finally managed to approach sprinting distance. They had only one thought in their minds—to break through this fragile defense line and slaughter those cowards who only cowered behind it, operating their nefarious weapons. Crossing the final one hundred and fifty meters required merely twenty short breaths, and the remaining knights all bent low, pushing their horses to their maximum speed.



However, this one hundred and fifty meters, seemingly within reach, was an insurmountably distant stretch. The last round of buckshot for close-range shooting completely shattered the knights' will to fight. Within a hundred-meter radius, the hard iron pellets were capable of piercing through two to three people. The conical area in front of the cannon became the realm of the Grim Reaper, and nearly all of the twenty or so knights at the forefront were spared no mercy, the only difference being the number of pellets they took.



The formation collapsed. 



A team scattered by fear had no chance of rallying again, and the knights at the rear turned their horses around, trying to flee the battlefield.



Seeing the knights' retreat, the mercenaries naturally had no desire to step forward. They had always worked for money, and risking their lives was never part of their deal. Now was the time to retreat, and the mercenaries ran even faster than when they had arrived.



The tide of defeat swept up the Duke of Lion's allied army, and the situation quickly spiraled out of control. People crowded and fled backward in panic, those who fell were trampled to death, no one had the time to care for others, cursing themselves for not having an extra pair of legs.



The tune of the Guerrilla Squad's song now echoed throughout the field, as the infantry, lined up in battle formation, stepped forward in unison, beginning to sweep the battlefield.
