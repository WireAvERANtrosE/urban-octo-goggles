## Border Town Defense Battle (Part 2)
A knight's charge does not reach its maximum speed from the start, as the horses have limited stamina and can only maintain high speeds for a short time. Typically, they would trot for about one thousand to eight hundred meters, gradually accelerate at five hundred meters, and then sprint within the last two hundred meters.

When the twelve-pound Napoleon cannon fires solid shot, its theoretical effective range can reach one thousand three hundred meters. Perhaps due to the short barrel length, Roland's cannons were wildly inaccurate beyond a kilometer, so he had to stipulate in training to open fire within eight hundred meters. At this distance, the accuracy of the cannon was guaranteed, and with the cannonball bouncing forward after hitting the ground, causing line damage, the likelihood of hitting multiple targets was still relatively high.

Duke Ryan, wanting to have the mercenaries go first, ordered the knights to stand by in the acceleration zone—a region that was absolutely safe under normal circumstances, as neither bows nor crossbows could threaten the knights who had ample distance to increase their horse's speed. The low assembly efficiency of the mercenaries caused the already positioned knights to pull on their mounts' reins and stand still, waiting. For the artillery team, they had become almost stationary targets.

The Duke did not know that as soon as his troops stepped onto this land, they had fallen into the battlefield Roland had prepared. The road in the middle was flat and spacious, while the sides were filled with plants catalyzed by Leaf, appearing like ordinary grasslands, but beneath the knee-high weeds were thick vines hidden like tripwires. If the cavalry wanted to flank the defensive line, they could only move forward at a very slow speed. Within a kilometer range, all distances had been marked by Soraya. The markings might not be clear on the ground, but from Lightning's aerial view, the battlefield was precisely divided into sections, with different colors representing different distances—the enemy advanced as if on a ruler, and the gunners no longer needed to calculate the angle of fire, but simply followed the predetermined procedures from drills.

The twelve-pound cannon from Van'er's team roared first.

The large amount of gas generated by the gunpowder combustion pushed the cannonball out, accelerating to over four hundred meters per second as it left the barrel. In almost the span of two breaths, the cannonball smashed into the ground with a howl, passing between two knights and landing in the grass beside the road. The splashing mud and stones startled the horses, causing one knight who couldn't react in time to fall from his horse.

The following two cannon shots also missed, kicking up a series of dust.

The first round of shooting from the four cannons only turned the last group into the lucky ones—initially, no one was in front of this iron ball, but a knight happened to control his startled mount and pass in front of it. The armor was as good as non-existent against the cannonball's enormous kinetic energy; the iron ball pierced through the thin iron plate along with flesh and, after a minor bounce on the ground, broke the leg of another knight. His horse was also disemboweled, spilling its innards on the ground.

If the knight regiment had been in a normal acceleration phase, the next round of cannon fire should have adjusted the angle first, but this sudden attack clearly stunned the Duke's allied forces. They didn't even know where the attack came from, nor the method used—the speed of the cannonball exceeded the ability of the naked eye to recognize. The knights did not receive an attack command and still lingered in place, trying to calm their restless mounts.

The Van'er unit completed the reloading procedure with the greatest speed, and the second round of bombardment began. 
Flesh and bone were exposed to the fragility and softness under the firepower of the weapons. Once grazed by a cannonball, irreparable severe injuries were inevitable. Knights who were hit directly were left with limbs severed into several pieces, along with clouds of blood mist that splattered around. It was only after the cannonballs hit the ground and caused secondary shrapnel to fly that people could vaguely see a blurry black phantom, wantonly plundering the lives of its companions amidst the crowd.
After two rounds of bombardment, the Duke finally connected the enemy camp's lights, the roars, and the inexplicable strikes together. The enemy seemed to possess an inconceivable weapon, its range far exceeding that of bows and crossbows, almost comparable to the trebuchet of a fortress. Realizing this, the Duke ordered his men to sound the horn for an attack—the closer they got, the more ineffective this long-range striking weapon would become.
However, the knights showed utterly different reactions. Some of them, upon hearing the horn, began to accelerate towards the town, some were still struggling with their mounts, and a small number had already started retreating, along with the mercenaries who surged forward, creating utter chaos on the battlefield.
The attacking knights returned to the main road, and the gunners became busy. Apart from cleaning the barrels and loading ammunition, they also had to reposition the gun carriages. At this moment, Lightning returned to the airspace above the defensive line, with her ribbon changed to red.
The red signal meant that the enemy had approached within five hundred meters, and within this distance, the hit rate of direct cannon fire could reach over eighty percent.
Van'er shouted, "Adjust the firing angle to level! Quick, fire, fire!"
After the deafening roar of the cannons, he didn't even bother to observe the outcome, and immediately turned to the ammunition handlers and bellowed, "Bring up the buckshot!"
During the artillery training, His Royal Highness had emphasized multiple times that if the red signal was seen, those with solid shot already loaded should fire immediately and then load buckshot. If not yet loaded, they should switch to buckshot and wait for the enemy to enter within three hundred meters before firing.

The buckshot looked like a cylindrical tin can, packed with iron pellets the size of fingertips and sawdust. Its diameter was slightly smaller than the gun bore, so after loading the powder bag, an additional thin wooden board had to be stuffed in before the buckshot was inserted.

As they awaited the purple signal from Lightning, the four cannons fired almost simultaneously.

This was also Vanner's first time using buckshot in live fire—according to His Highness, the buckshot was difficult to recover after being fired, so they only practiced the procedure without igniting. Today, he witnessed for the first time the astonishing lethality of this special type of ammunition.

The tin cans burst open as they left the cannon due to the tremendous pressure difference, and the iron pellets inside scattered towards the enemy like raindrops. Knights within three hundred meters were instantly enveloped by a rain of metal. Blood blossoms burst forth from the bodies of men and horses as they fell to the ground en masse, like wheat being harvested. Some pellets, still possessing significant kinetic energy after penetrating through bodies, left no escape for targets stacked on top of each other.

The knights fortunate enough not to be covered by the barrage finally managed to approach the sprinting distance, with only one thought in their minds—to break through the thin line of defense and slaughter those cowards who only knew how to cower behind the line, operating wicked weapons. Crossing the final one hundred and fifty meters required merely twenty breaths of time, and the remaining knights bent low, pushing their horses to maximum speed.

However, this one hundred and fifty meters, seemingly within reach, was an insurmountable distance. The last round of close-range buckshot completely broke the knights' will to fight. Within a hundred-meter range, the iron pellets, which did not easily deform, could penetrate two to three people. The conical area in front of the gun muzzle became the domain of the Grim Reaper, with almost none of the twenty-some leading knights spared; the only difference was the number of pellets that hit them.

The formation collapsed.

Troops disintegrated by fear had no chance of rallying; the knights behind them reined in their horses, attempting to flee the battlefield.

Seeing the knights' order dissolve into flight, the mercenaries naturally had no desire to advance another step. They had always worked for money, and risking their lives was never part of their bargain. Now was the time to retreat; the mercenaries ran even faster than they had come.

The tide of defeat swept over Duke Ryan's allied forces, and the situation quickly spiraled out of control. People crowded and fled backward in panic, trampling those who fell to their deaths. No one had the time to care for others, only cursing why they didn't have an extra pair of legs.

The tune of the guerrilla song now echoed across the field as the infantry, lined up in battle formation, stepped out in unison, beginning to sweep the battlefield.
