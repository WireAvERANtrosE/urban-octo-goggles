## Wicked Moon (Part 2)
"Not many, Your Highness. Each Demonic Moon only brings about two or three such magical beasts. Otherwise, the Longsong Stronghold would be facing great trouble."
"Good, you have observed carefully," Roland commanded the hunter to stand up, "What is your name? You don't look like a person from Greycastle."
"I have half Mohist blood, the people in town call me Iron Axe."
Mohist, the Sand People from the deserts in the southwest of the kingdom, said to be descendants of the sand giants. Roland searched his memories; he didn't use a clan name, but a title, obviously not wanting to be associated with the Sand People. As for why he came from the southwestern border to this desolate land, there was probably a series of bitter stories.
But those were not the point, Border Town did not concern itself with one's origin.
Roland clapped his hands, "That's all for today, Carter, reward them with ten Silver Royals each and take them down."
"Thank you for your reward, Your Highness," the three said in unison.
After taking the men away, Carter Lannis returned, "Your Highness, by asking these questions, do you intend to stay here?"
Roland was noncommittal, "What do you think?"
"That's absolutely not possible, Your Highness!" the knight said loudly, "According to the hunter, just dealing with the demonic beasts of the boar type is difficult enough. Crossbows can't penetrate them from fifty steps away, you have to wait until forty or thirty steps to shoot. Only the elite soldiers of the stronghold can achieve this. Moreover, with their large numbers, without a solid city wall to rely on, relying only on the local guards to stop them, I'm afraid that casualties will exceed ten percent before they collapse."
"You said the same before seeing the witch. Can't you look on the bright side of things?" Roland sighed.
"That... Although witches are evil, Miss Anna... Miss Anna doesn't seem to be so. As your knight, I must be realistic."
"Is that so? What if I give you a wall?"
"What?" Carter doubted he had heard correctly for a moment.
"I'll give you a wall, between the foothills of the Northern Slope and the Redwater River," Roland said word by word, "Although it won't be as majestic as the walls of Greycastle's King's City, it should still be sufficient to stop the magical beasts."
"Your Highness, do you realize what you are saying?" The knight laughed with exasperation, "There's a limit to fooling around. If you don't leave when the time comes, then please forgive my impertinence."

"There are still three months, right? I've looked at past records, and the first snow here usually arrives at the end of the second month after the start of winter."

"Three years wouldn't be enough! Constructing a city wall requires a large workforce, starting from the foundation by tamping mixed soil. Every one to two feet filled, it needs to be compacted, otherwise piling it up high will risk collapse. And this is just the simplest type of earth wall," Carter shook his head repeatedly, "A brick and stone wall would be even slower, requiring hundreds of masons to chisel the stones into squares in advance, then stacking them one by one. Your Highness, every city wall is built this way, there are no exceptions. A city rising overnight is a tale from myths and legends."

Roland gestured for him to stop, "I understand. You don't have to jump to conclusions so quickly, if by that time we don't have a reliable wall, I will retreat with you to Longsong Stronghold. I have no intention of losing my life in this godforsaken place."

The knight knelt on one knee, "I will protect you with my life!"

...

In the castle garden, Roland sipped the bitter barley beer, his mood greatly improved as he watched Anna, who was focused on eating the cream pastries.

He had decided to stop the demonic beasts at Border Town—if they couldn't even defend their main base, there was no point in talking about farming. To build a wall connecting the northern slope and the Redwater River in three months, rational plans and era-surpassing technology were necessary.

Roland wasn't just having a flight of fancy. He had personally inspected the surroundings of Border Town (even though it wasn’t in person), and the memory of it remained clear in his mind—the closest distance between the base of the northern slope and the Redwater River was just over six hundred meters, a natural choke point. And because of years of mining, the area around the northern slope mine was piled with rocks excavated from the mine.

These rocks had a gray-white cross-section, rich in calcium carbonate, which could be used as limestone when ground up. And with limestone, you essentially have cement.

Indeed, this hydraulic material that changed human construction history had a wide range of sources and was simple to prepare, truly one of the most valuable tools for farming.

Roland estimated in his mind that making concrete was out of the question—not because it couldn't be done technically, but because the amount of cement required was simply too great, and he wasn't confident that he could calcine so much cement powder in three months. Additionally, concrete was not very ductile, and it needed to be used with steel bars to become complete, so building a concrete wall was clearly not realistic.

To maximize the conservation of cement and make use of existing materials, a rubble masonry gravity wall was the most appropriate choice.

Rubble refers to stones that have not been polished and maintain their natural state as when they were mined. Such stones, because of their irregular shapes and angles, cannot be directly stacked and need to be processed by masons into brick-like shapes for use. A rubble wall, on the other hand, uses cement as a binder, and stones of any peculiar shape can be piled on top, with the gaps between the stones filled with cement, saving cement and not being picky about materials.

The general direction was set, but putting it into practice would likely require his personal involvement, Roland thought. Whether it was calcining cement or laying a rubble wall, these were all new things. No one besides himself had seen these things, nor did anyone know how to do them. It looks like the next three months are going to be busy.

"Look."

Anna's crisp voice came from behind.

Roland turned his head and saw a small cluster of flames quietly appear in her palm. There was clearly no wind around, yet the tip of the flame undulated up and down, as if nodding to her in greeting. She wiggled her fingers, and the flame moved towards her fingertips like a toddler learning to walk. Finally, it settled at the tip of her index finger, calming down.

"You did it."

Roland marveled at the incredible scene inside. This was no sleight of hand magic trick, nor a chemical ruse, but a genuine supernatural power. However, what attracted Roland the most was not the flame, but Anna's expression.

She was intently staring at her fingertip, her eyes clear as lake water, reflecting the dancing flame, like a sprite sealed within a sapphire. The traces of torture from her time in prison had faded, and although she rarely smiled, her face was no longer lifeless. Tiny beads of sweat appeared on the girl's delicate nose, her cheeks flushed with a lively pink, even just looking at her could lift one's spirits.

"What's wrong?"

"Ah... Nothing," Roland realized he had been staring at her for too long, he averted his gaze and coughed twice, "Now, let's try using it to melt a block of iron."

In the past few days, apart from eating and sleeping, she had been practicing repeatedly in the shed, her diligence made Roland feel embarrassed—he had never been so studious, not even for the college entrance examination.

It seemed that it wouldn't take long for her to master this power, Roland thought. With this, the new project he had been contemplating for a long time could also be scheduled.
