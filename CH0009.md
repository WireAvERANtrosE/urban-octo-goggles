## Wicked Moon (Part 2)
"Not many, Your Highness, each Evil Months there are only two or three such demonic beasts, otherwise, Longsong Stronghold would be facing great trouble."

"Good, you observe carefully," Roland ordered the hunter to stand up, "What is your name? You don't look like you're from Greycastle."

"I have half Mojin lineage, the townspeople all call me Iron Axe."

Mojin, the Sand People from the deserts in the southwest of the kingdom, are said to be descendants of the sand giants. Roland searched his memories, noting that he didn't use a clan name but a title instead, clearly not wanting to associate with the Sand People again. As for why he would leave the southwestern border to come to this desolate land, there was probably a string of sad stories.

But those weren't the focus, Border Town didn't care about one's background.

Roland clapped his hands, "That's all for today, Carter, reward them each with ten Silver Royals and escort them out."

"Thank you for your grace, Your Highness," the three said in unison.

After sending them away, Carter Lannis came back and asked, "Your Highness, are you asking these questions because you want to stay here?"

Roland was noncommittal, "What do you think?"



"This is absolutely impossible, Your Highness!" the knight said loudly. "According to the hunters, the demonic beasts of the boar breed are very difficult to deal with. A crossbow can't penetrate them from fifty steps away, you have to wait until forty or thirty steps to shoot, and only the elite soldiers of the stronghold can do that. Moreover, with their large numbers, without the support of sturdy walls, relying solely on the local guards to stop them, I'm afraid that if the casualties exceed ten percent, they will disperse."



"You said the same thing before seeing the witch. Can't you think more positively?" Roland sighed.



"This... Although witches are evil, Miss Anna... Miss Anna doesn't seem to be like that. As your knight, I must stick to the facts."



"Is that so? What if I give you a town wall?"



"What?" Carter doubted for a moment if he had heard wrong.



"I'll give you a town wall, right between the foothills of the North Slope Mountain and the Redwater River," Roland said, word by word, "Although it won't be as majestic as the walls of Greycastle, it should still be sufficient to stop the demonic beasts."



"Your Highness, do you realize what you're saying?" The knight laughed in disbelief. "There's a limit to fooling around. If you don't leave when the time comes, then please forgive my impertinence."



"There are still three months, right? I've looked through the past records, and the first snow here mostly comes at the end of February after the start of winter."



"Not enough even in three years! Building a town wall requires a large number of workers, starting with the foundation made of compacted soil. Every one or two feet filled has to be compacted, otherwise, if it gets too high, it will collapse. This is just the simplest type of earthen wall," Carter shook his head repeatedly, "A brick and stone wall would be even slower, requiring hundreds of masons to chisel the stones into squares in advance, then stacking them one by one. Your Highness, every town wall is built this way, there are no exceptions. The idea of a building rising overnight is a tale found only in myths and legends."



Roland signaled for him to stop, "I understand. You don't have to jump to conclusions so quickly, if by that time there is no reliable town wall, I will retreat with you to Longsong Stronghold. I have no plans to throw my life away in this godforsaken place."

The knight knelt on one knee and said, "I will protect you with my life!"



...



In the castle garden, Roland took a sip of the bitter barley beer, looking at Anna who was focusing on eating the cream pastries, his mood improved a bit.

He had decided to stop the demonic beasts at Border Town—If they couldn't even defend their main base, there was no point in talking about farming. To build a wall connecting the northern slope and the Redwater River within three months, they must adopt a reasonable plan and use cross-era technology.

Roland's idea was not a sudden whim. He had personally surveyed the surroundings of Border Town (though not by himself), and the memory still held a clear picture—the nearest distance between the foot of the northern slope and the Redwater River was only a little over six hundred meters, a natural choke point. And due to the long-term mining, the area around the northern slope mines was piled high with rubble from the excavated rock layers.

The rubble had a gray-white cross-section, rich in calcium carbonate, which could be used as limestone when ground up. And with limestone, there was essentially cement.

Indeed, this material that changed the history of human construction had widespread sources, was simple to prepare, and was one of the best tools for farming.

Roland estimated in his mind that creating concrete was out of the question, not because it was technologically impossible, but because the amount of cement needed was simply too great, and he wasn't confident that he could calcine so much cement powder within three months. Additionally, concrete had poor ductility and needed to be used in conjunction with steel reinforcement bars to become complete, so constructing a concrete wall was clearly not very realistic.



To maximize the conservation of cement while utilizing existing materials, a rubble stone gravity wall is the most appropriate choice.

Rubble stone refers to raw, unpolished stones in their natural state as they are mined. Because the edges and shapes of these stones are irregular, they cannot be directly used for construction and must be processed by stonemasons into brick-like shapes. A rubble stone wall uses cement as an adhesive, allowing stones of even the most peculiar shapes to be stacked. The gaps between the stones are filled with cement, which saves on cement and is not picky about materials.

The general direction was set, but to actually implement it, Roland thought, he would probably have to do it himself. Whether it was calcining cement or building a rubble stone wall, it was all brand new. Apart from himself, no one had seen these things before, nor did anyone know how to do them. It looked like he would be busy for the next three months.

"Look."

Anna's crisp voice came from behind.

Roland turned his head to see a small cluster of flames quietly appearing in her palm. There was clearly no wind around, yet the tip of the flame undulated, as if nodding in greeting to her. She shook her finger, and the flame, like a toddler learning to walk, slowly moved towards the tip. Finally, it settled at the top of her index finger and calmed down.

"You did it."

Roland marveled inwardly at the incredible scene. This was not a magician's sleight of hand or a chemical trick, but a true supernatural power. But what attracted Roland the most was not the flame—what shone brighter than the flame was Anna's expression.

She concentrated intently on the flame at her fingertip, her eyes as clear as lake water, reflecting the dancing flames, like a sprite sealed within a sapphire. The traces of torture from the prison had faded on her, and although she rarely smiled, her face was no longer lifeless. Droplets of sweat appeared on the girl's delicate nose, and her pale cheeks flushed with a lively glow, making even an onlooker feel cheerful.



"What's wrong?"

"Ah... it's nothing," Roland realized he had been staring at her for too long. He shifted his gaze away and coughed twice, "Next, let's try using it to melt the iron block."

In the past few days, except for eating and sleeping, she had been practicing repeatedly in the shed. Her diligence made Roland feel ashamed—he had never worked that hard, not even for the college entrance examination.

It seemed that it wouldn't be long before she would become proficient with this power, Roland thought. With that, the new project he had been contemplating for a long time could also be put on the schedule.
