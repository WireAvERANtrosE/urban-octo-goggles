## Among the mountains
Nightingale walked slowly along the mountain path.

The road under her feet was no wider than shoulder-width, with a huge stone wall on one side and steep rocks on the other. The two were separated by a gap of about ten feet wide, with a chasm in between that was bottomless. She carefully followed the stone wall to avoid slipping down.

Looking up, the sky was reduced to a thin line that faintly glowed, like a strand of silver hanging in the night sky. But she knew that it was just past noon—at this time of day, even though it was daylight, she needed to lift a torch to see where she was going, as the light filtering through the rock walls was not enough to illuminate the path ahead. After walking for a while, she would even start to feel as if she was walking inside the mountain itself.

The only advantage of this place was that, although the wind howled and snow flew in the mountains, the chasm was always unaffected. Occasionally, a few snowflakes would fall from above, landing on the mountain wall or the path and quickly turning into vapor. The temperature here was uncharacteristically warm compared to the outside world, and occasionally, she could see steam rising from the abyss beneath her feet.

If it weren't for this, she wouldn't dare to venture alone into the Impassable Mountain Range during the Evil Months. The Mist could hide her figure, but it couldn't block out the cold. If she had to walk against the cold wind, she probably wouldn't last an hour before freezing to death in the snow.

However, Nightingale was reluctant to stay here any longer than necessary—she always felt as if something was watching her in the dark, sending shivers down her spine.

If possible, Nightingale wished she could complete the journey in the Mist, but unfortunately, her physical strength did not support such an endeavor. Using her ability for extended periods would quickly exhaust her.

Nightingale raised her torch, and the opposite rock wall flickered in and out of view in the weak light of the fire. Occasionally, she could see shadows of various sizes on the wall across the way. Nightingale knew those were caves because they were so deep that the light couldn't penetrate them, making them appear like clumps of shadows. And the stone wall she was leaning closely against had corresponding deep holes at the same positions.

This reminded her of the rumors about the northern slope mine, which was said to have been the lair of underground monsters in the past, with many branching paths all dug out by the monsters. And since the northern slope was just a corner of the Impassable Mountain Range, could it be that these caves also had passages connected to the mine?



The thought made her shiver.

To the west of the Impassable Mountain Range was the barbarian wasteland where no man had set foot. If it was said that countless holes could be dug within the towering mountain range that stretched for hundreds of miles, perhaps only the monsters that lived in the barbarian wasteland could accomplish such a feat.

She dared not continue the thought and focused her mind to keep moving forward.

Finally, the road ahead changed. The shoulder-width path split into two, one veering slightly upwards and the other turning straight down, extending deeper, with its end quickly swallowed by the darkness, leaving no one to know where it ultimately led. Standing at the fork, the feeling of being watched had grown intense, as if countless eyes in the darkness were fixated on her, motionless, causing her to feel dry-mouthed and her scalp to tingle.

Nightingale gritted her teeth, activated her Mist, and briskly walked upwards. Soon, the strange sensation disappeared.

As she climbed higher, the temperature around her gradually decreased, and the strands of silver above her head grew wider. Half a quarter of an hour later, a huge cavern appeared to her front right, its entrance slightly higher than the road surface. She lifted her leg and stepped into the cave, where she could faintly see the glow of a fire deep inside.

This was the hiding place of the Mutual Aid Society.

Nightingale stepped out of the Mist and was immediately spotted by a witch on guard, a wall of black mist blocking her path, but it quickly dissipated into nothingness. Surprised cries of her companions echoed in the darkness, "You're back!"

She was finally back, she thought. However, when she noticed the two strips of white cloth wrapped around her companion's arm, Nightingale's heart sank once more, "Two more sisters..."



The other party's voice paused for a moment, "Uh... Ah, it's Annie and Ashes, they didn't make it through adulthood five days ago." She forced a smile, "It happens all the time, doesn't it? Let's not talk about this anymore, let's hurry to the camp. Wendy has been missing you for a long time."



Annie and Ashes, a pair of twins brought out from a wealthy family in Dragon Cliffs City, ended their lives in these deep mountains. Nightingale sometimes wondered if what she was doing was right. If she hadn't taken them away, at least they could have enjoyed a life of plenty before death came, instead of living a nomadic and unsettled life with everyone.



But thinking of Wendy, a warm current surged in Nightingale's heart. If it weren't for Wendy reaching out to her, she might still be used like a puppet, a tool that could be discarded at any time. That's right, she needed to pass on this news early, tell all the sisters, they don't have to hide like mice anymore, there is already someone willing to accept them, and... there is even a possibility to safely get through the annual Awakening Day!



Walking into the camp, Nightingale saw a familiar figure squatting by the bonfire handling food. Before she even arrived, she couldn't help but shout out, "Wendy, I'm back."



The figure paused, lifted her head, and then revealed the familiar smile Nightingale knew, "Veronica, welcome home."



Wendy was an extremely kind woman and one of the earliest members of the Witch Cooperation Association. Now in her thirties, her face did not show a single wrinkle, her reddish-brown straight hair was nearly waist-length, and her features were mature and charming, like an elder sister to everyone. She cared for every sister in the Witch Cooperation Association, providing help in both daily life and psychological counseling as much as she could. Without Wendy, it would have been impossible for the Witch Cooperation Association to gather so many witches so quickly.



It was because of meeting her that Nightingale resolutely left her family and embarked on the journey to find the Holy Mountain. She was also one of the few people who knew her original name.



"I've said it many times, I'm no longer the weak girl I used to be," Nightingale said with a smile, shaking her head. "I am now a powerful witch, Veronica no longer exists."



"The you from the past is also you, getting rid of the nightmares of the past doesn't mean you have to cut ties with it," Wendy said softly. "Of course, as long as you're happy. Nightingale, I've been waiting for you to come back. You must have had a hard journey."



"Um," Nightingale stepped forward and embraced her, "Thank you."



After a while, Wendy finally asked, "How is that girl doing, you... weren't able to save her?"



Speaking of this, Nightingale suddenly became energized, she grabbed the other's arm excitedly and said, "No, she didn't need me to save her, on the contrary, she saved all of us!" Then she detailed her experiences in Border Town, "The lord there is called Roland Wimbledon, the fourth prince of the Kingdom of Greycastle, and he is willing to provide us with shelter. Moreover, he has promised that one day, he will allow witches to live in his territory just like free people!"
