## Migrants
The sailboat from Longsong Stronghold slowly docked at the pier of Border Town.

After the gangplank was lowered, the people on board, carrying all sorts of luggage, disembarked one after another. Most of them were setting foot on this unfamiliar land for the first time, their expressions somewhat bewildered, and the urging of the sailors behind them only intensified their unease.

Amidst the jostling crowd, a middle-aged woman slipped and lost her balance, about to fall off the gangway. Another woman quickly stepped forward, grabbed her wrist, and steadied her.

"Thank... thank you," the rescued woman said, her hand on her chest, repeatedly expressing her gratitude.

The young woman merely smiled and waved her hand, indicating it was nothing.

Philip Eltek, who was waiting at the edge of the pier, instantly recognized the agile young woman from the crowd—the star of tomorrow from the Stronghold Theater, Irene, his beloved wife. She was dressed in a pristine white dress, her long hair done up atop her head, still looking as ethereally beautiful as ever.

The First Knight, containing his excitement, waited until she safely set foot on land from the pier, then quickly stepped forward and hugged her tightly, utterly disregarding the stares and whispers of the people around. She was startled at first, but upon recognizing Philip, she tenderly returned his embrace.

"I was terrified when I heard the news of the Duke's army's crushing defeat. I wanted to see you when I was in Longsong Stronghold, but unfortunately, there was no chance," she whispered in the knight's ear, "I'm relieved that you are safe."

"I was locked up in the dungeons of the lord's castle at that time, the guards would have never let you in," Philip released his wife, "How have you been these past few weeks?"



"...," she fell silent for a moment, "I've left the theater."

Philip immediately understood the meaning behind his wife's words. When he was still the first knight of the Western Region, only the duke dared to lay hands on her. Now that he had become a prisoner at the mercy of His Highness, those coveting Irene no longer needed to hide their malice, each ready to seize the opportunity to make a move. Continuing to work at the theater now would undoubtedly be like throwing a sheep into a tiger's mouth.



"It's okay, I have a job here, and the pay isn't too bad," he consoled, "Let's go home and talk."

"Home?" Irene looked somewhat surprised, "Don't we have to live separately?"

Generally speaking, prisoners who were neither executed nor ransomed were mostly used as laborers, living in tents and barracks where many people crowded together, lying down on straw-covered ground to sleep. The treatment of prisoner's family members wasn't much better; women had their own camps, also sleeping on the ground, and when the men were out working, they were responsible for tidying up their living spaces, as well as boiling water, cooking, and washing clothes.



Thinking of this, Philip was somewhat touched. At the Stronghold Farm, she at least had a spacious room, a comfortable bed, and soft bedding. But for him, she still chose to come to Border Town alone, even if it meant squeezing into a small house or tent with other women and enduring forced labor every day, she did not shrink back.



"I am now a teacher," he took Irene's luggage and held her hand, walking towards the New Area, "and teachers can get a set of free housing."

To be honest, when he first heard His Highness announce the treatment for teachers, he hadn't had high hopes—being a prisoner, having a room was already good enough. Even a wooden house with leaks would be livable with some repairs. The result, however, was unexpectedly... formal.



Entering the neighborhood, the streets suddenly became spacious. The ground was covered with gray-white gravel, pressed flat by a roller, and walking on it didn't feel rough at all. At first, Philip didn't understand this practice and thought the stonemasons were wasting manpower and time. It wasn't until after a heavy rain, when the water flowed through the gaps in the stones and into the ground, then into the drainage ditches on both sides, that he understood the reason. Compared to the muddy, puddle-filled alleys of Longsong Stronghold after the rain, such streets were obviously much better.



Irene looked around with some confusion and asked, "All the houses here seem to be newly built, could we have taken a wrong turn?"

"No, my dear, we are almost there."

Following the neighborhood streets and taking two turns, Philip Eltek stopped with Irene in front of a two-story brick house, "Here we are."

"Where?" She looked around before finally setting her gaze on the brand-new building in front of the knight, covering her mouth in disbelief, "Could it be... this entire house is our home?"

"Of course not," he laughed, "This is the teachers' building. Our home is on the second floor in the middle. Come on, let's go up."

He took out the keys to open the door, and Philip, holding his wife's hand, entered their new home—a residence that included a main hall, two bedrooms, and two auxiliary rooms, all fully furnished. Although not large, it was surprisingly comfortable. Both the decoration of the main hall and the arrangement of the bedrooms felt refreshing. Now with Irene, this home was even more perfect.

"My goodness, were you really captured and brought here?" Irene eagerly ran into each room to inspect, excited like a child, "We're going to live here from now on?"

"Yes, of course." Philip smiled as he took out some biscuits and cheese from the cupboard and placed them on the table, "You haven't eaten anything on the ship, right? Fill your stomach first, I have to go back to work soon."

"That's right, you're a teacher now," Irene ran back to her husband, "Which noble's children will you be instructing?"



"Not a noble, but a commoner who instructs His Highness the Prince."

"Commoner?" She paused, "Instruct in what?"

Philip picked up a book from the side of the table and handed it to his wife, "Teaching them to read and write, this is what His Highness gave me... 'Textbook'."

When he chose to become a teacher, he had worried about being inadequate for the job—after all, it was usually the learned and talented white-haired elders who held this position. But His Highness seemed unconcerned, saying that teaching according to the textbook would suffice. It was only when he saw this so-called textbook that he realized that teaching reading and writing could be broken down to such a degree.



From the teaching methods to the content of the course, everything was included. The first page even listed a dozen common questions for new teachers, such as how to become an excellent teacher? How to entice students' interest in learning? How to test the effectiveness of teaching? The answers were plain and simple, making one have moments of sudden realization. Even before he had started teaching, he was already deeply captivated by this book.



It was evidently the same for Irene, who had grown up in a theater and had read more books and scripts than Philip, a knight who had once exclaimed that with his wife's looks and intelligence, if she had been born into a noble family, she would certainly have become a distinguished woman known throughout the entire Western Region.



After flipping through a few pages, Irene suddenly looked up and asked, "You mentioned before... that the salary for a teacher is quite good?"

"Twenty Silver Royals a month, with an increase of five every year."

"There's no theater here, right?"



"No... There isn't," Philip hesitated, already guessing what his wife was thinking.

Sure enough, she closed the book with a smile and said, "Then I want to become a teacher too, my dear, just like you."
