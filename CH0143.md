## Migrants
The sailboat from Longsong Stronghold slowly docked at the pier of Border Town.
After the gangplank was lowered, people carrying all kinds of bags disembarked one after another. Most were setting foot on this unfamiliar land for the first time, looking somewhat bewildered, and the urging of the sailors behind them only intensified their unease.
Amidst the jostling crowd, a middle-aged woman's foot slipped, and she lost her balance, about to fall off the bridge. Another woman stepped forward swiftly, grabbing her wrist and stabilizing her.
"Thank... thank you," the saved woman said, clutching her chest in relief, thanking her repeatedly.
The woman merely smiled and waved her hand, indicating it was nothing.
From the edge of the pier, waiting, Phyllis Silt immediately recognized the nimble young woman from the crowd—the rising star of the fortress theater, Irene, his beloved wife. She wore a pure white dress, her long hair pinned atop her head, looking as beautiful and ethereal as ever.
The First Knight, holding back his excitement, waited until she safely stepped onto land from the pier, then quickly approached and hugged her tightly, completely disregarding the stares and gossip of those around. She was startled at first, but upon recognizing Phyllis, she tenderly returned his embrace.
"The news of the duke's army's great defeat really scared me. When I was at Longsong Stronghold, I wanted to see you, but unfortunately, I had no chance," she whispered in the knight's ear, "I'm glad you're safe."
"I was locked in the dungeons of the lord's castle at that time; the guards would never have let you in," Phyllis released his wife, "How have you been these past months?"

"...," she paused for a moment, "I left the theater."

Phyllis immediately understood the meaning behind his wife's words. When he was still the first knight of the Western Territory, only the Duke dared to lay hands on her. Now that he had become a prisoner under the Prince's feet, those coveting Irene no longer needed to hide their malice, each of them waiting for an opportunity to make their move. Continuing to work at the theater would be like throwing sheep into a tiger's den.

"It's alright, I have a job here, and the pay isn't too bad," he comforted her, "Let's go home and talk."

"Home?" Irene seemed surprised, "Don't we have to live separately?"

Generally speaking, prisoners who were neither executed nor ransomed were mostly used as laborers, living in tents and barracks, many crammed together, lying on straw-covered floors as their beds. The treatment of the prisoners' families wasn't much better; there were special camps for women, who also had to sleep on the ground. When the men went to work, the women were responsible for cleaning their living spaces, as well as boiling water, cooking, and washing clothes.

Thinking of this, Phyllis felt moved. At the fortress farm, she at least had a spacious room, a comfortable bed, and soft bedding. Yet for his sake, she chose to come to Border Town alone, even if it meant squeezing into a small house or tent with other women and being subjected to forced labor every day; she did not shrink back.

"I am now a teacher," he took Irene's luggage and held her hand, walking towards the New District, "and teachers can get a set of free housing."

To be honest, when he first heard His Highness announce the treatment for teachers, he didn't have high hopes—as a prisoner, having a room was already good enough. Even if it was a leaky wooden house, he figured he could fix it up and make it habitable. The reality, however, turned out to be unexpectedly... proper.

Entering the neighborhood, the streets suddenly became spacious, covered with grey-white gravel, pressed flat by a roller, not feeling rough at all underfoot. Phyllis didn't understand this practice at first, thinking that the stonemasons were wasting manpower and time. It wasn't until after a heavy rain, when the water flowed down through the gaps in the stones into the ground, then into the drainage ditches on both sides, that he understood the reason behind it. Compared to the alleys in Longsong Stronghold that became muddy and full of puddles with every rain, such streets were clearly much better.

Eileen looked around, somewhat puzzled, and asked, "All the houses here seem to be newly built, are you sure we haven't taken the wrong path?"
"No, my dear, we are almost there."
Following the neighborhood street and turning two corners, Phyllis Silt led Eileen to a stop in front of a two-story brick house, "Here it is."
"Where?" She looked around left and right, then cast her gaze on the brand-new building in front of the knight, covering her mouth in disbelief, "Could it be... this whole house is our home?"
"Of course not," he laughed, "This is the teachers' building. Our home is on the second floor, in the middle. Come on, let's go up."
Taking out the keys to open the door, Phyllis pulled his wife's hand and entered their new home—a residence that included a main hall, two bedrooms, and two auxiliary rooms, all fully furnished. Although not large, it was surprisingly comfortable. Whether it was the decoration of the main hall or the layout of the bedrooms, it all felt fresh and new. Now with Eileen, this home was even more perfect.
"My goodness, were you really captured and brought here?" Eileen couldn't wait to run into each room to take a closer look, as excited as a child, "Are we going to live here from now on?"
"Mhm, of course." Phyllis smiled as he took out some biscuits and cheese from the cupboard and placed them on the table, "You haven't eaten anything on the boat, have you? Fill up your stomach first, I still have to go out to work later."
"That's right, you're a teacher now," Eileen ran back to her husband's side, "Whose children from the noble family are you going to teach?"

"Not a noble, but teaching the subjects for His Highness the prince."
"Subjects?" She paused, "Teach what?"
Phyllis picked up a book from the table and handed it to his wife. "Teach them to read and write, this is what His Highness gave me... 'textbook'."
When he chose to become a teacher, he was worried about whether he was up to the task—after all, this position was usually held by wise and learned elders with white hair. However, the prince didn't care and said that teaching according to the textbook would be sufficient. It was only when he saw this so-called textbook that he understood that teaching reading and writing could be broken down to such an extent.
From teaching methods to course content, it had everything. The first page even listed a dozen common questions for new teachers, such as how to become an excellent teacher? How to entice students' interest in learning? How to test the effectiveness of teaching? The answers were straightforward and simple, almost enlightening. He had not yet started teaching, but he was already deeply attracted by this book.
Eileen was obviously the same, having grown up in a theater, she had read more books and scripts than Phyllis, and the knight had once exclaimed that with his wife's beauty and intelligence, if she had been born into a noble family, she would certainly have become an outstanding woman known throughout the Western Region.
After flipping through a few pages, Eileen suddenly raised her head and asked, "You mentioned before... the teacher's salary is quite good?"
"Twenty Silver royals a month, with an increase of five each year."
"There's no theater here, right?"

"No... there isn't," Phyllis hesitated, already guessing what her husband was thinking.

Sure enough, the other party closed the book with a smile and said, "Then I also want to become a teacher, my dear, just like you."
