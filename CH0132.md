## Elk Knight (Part 1)
Primus had been locked up here for five days already.

Although it wasn't a prison cell, the renovated residence was almost no different from a cell—the wooden doors had all been replaced with railings, and all the furniture in the room was removed, leaving only a few blankets. The only advantage was that the room was still relatively clean, neither drafty nor leaky.

Besides him, there were four others in the cell. Three of them were from the Lion family, one belonged to the Wolfheart family, and he himself was a knight enfeoffed by the Elk Count.

"Damn it, just how long does he plan to keep us locked up!" The oldest-looking knight from the Lion family complained, "The wheat fields in my territory haven't been sown yet! My wife has no clue how to handle these matters."

"Your territory?" The young knight from the Wolfheart family sneered, "Do you think His Highness the Prince will leave the knight's fief for you to return, so you can gather horses, weapons, and armor to seek revenge? Honestly, he's already being merciful not having sent all of you to the gallows."

"What did you say!?" The old knight glared at him.

"Just stating the truth," the young knight said indifferently, "The Duke is the prime criminal in planning and executing the rebellion, and not cleaning out his elite knights would mean leaving them for his son. As for us, we were naturally coerced by the Duke's threats to join the battlefield."

"I think you're asking for death!" He walked over and grabbed the young man, his right fist clenched tight, about to strike, when a hand reached out from behind and firmly grasped his.

"Stop it, Harlon. Do you want to draw the guards here?" A handsome knight pressed down his fist, "He's not wrong; we are knights under the Duke's command, and we will certainly be severely sentenced when convicted. Now that it has come to this, we should just wait quietly for the outcome. Look at the people from the Elk family, and then look at yourself. Where are your noble manners?"



Primus recognized him, the star knight of Longsong Stronghold, Philip Eltek, nicknamed "Dawnlight," who had enchanted countless noble young ladies. Yet, he ended up marrying a commoner woman, which caused quite a stir at the time. Seeing that the other party mentioned him, Primus could no longer maintain his silence and addressed the three people arguing, "I'm not sure if the territory can be kept, but at least His Highness the Prince will not take your lives."



"Oh? Why?"



"Killing in the stronghold can at least serve as a deterrent, but what's the point of going through all the trouble to bring you here and kill you? For his own subjects to see?" Primus shook his head, "The Knights haven't even set foot in Border Town yet."



Without bursting in to kill and plunder, the townspeople naturally wouldn't develop extreme hatred. Therefore, for the Prince, showing the killing to the townspeople is less effective than showing it to the nobles of the stronghold. Since they haven't been killed in the stronghold, their lives are spared.



Philip thought for a moment, then nodded, "You make a good point. May I ask your name is..."



"Primus Dassault."



"Thank you for your reassurance, Sir Dassault." Philip gave him a grateful look and pulled Harlon back to sit in the corner.



The young man also plopped down, leaning against the wall and began to hum a song.



He really isn't afraid, Primus thought, while his own "calm" was nothing more than a forced facade.



Primus knew in his heart that he was not cut out to be a knight. He did not inherit his father's bravery, nor his mother's wisdom. He preferred tending to his own plot of land over wielding swords and fighting in battles. He liked to raise chickens and ducks, to fish by the pond. Reluctantly donning armor and wielding a sword to fight for Earl Elk was not his choice; he did not even like to participate in hunting. So, when it came time to charge into battle, Primus tried to stay as far back as possible, which unexpectedly saved his life.



Wait... With that thought, he suddenly found something odd. As the star knight under the Duke, why did Philip Eltek also survive? Shouldn't he have been at the forefront?



"The prince wants to see you," a guard suddenly shouted at the door, "Sonny Dali, you come out first."



The young knight sprang up, waved to everyone, and walked out of the cell.



"Hey, what about us?"



Harlon rushed to the door but was pushed back by the guard's short spear. After locking the cell door, the guard coldly said, "Don't worry, your turn will come."



Knowing that the trial was imminent, Primus grew more nervous. Damn it, he thought angrily. When there were no results, I always looked forward to this day, but now that it's coming, I'm scared. Yet his body couldn't help trembling, and every few breaths, he felt the urge to look up towards the door, just like the first time he faced the birth of a child, a mix of anticipation and fear.



Fortunately, the wait was not long. After about a quarter of an hour, the guard responsible for the escort returned, "Primus Dassault, it's your turn."



He stood up in a panic, but his foot got caught in the rolled-up blanket on the floor. Fortunately, Philip was quick to react and stepped forward to steady him.



"Thank you... thank you." He felt his throat was painfully dry.

"No trouble at all." The other's voice was calm and strong, which eased Primus's tense mood quite a bit.

He nodded at Philip and followed the guard out of the cell.

The one leading the way was a young lad, about seventeen years old, dressed in dark brown leather armor and boots, his hands holding a spear with a short shaft.

"Don't you need to tie my hands?" Primus asked.

"You were searched before you were locked up, you have no weapons, what can you do."

"Where are you taking me?"

"To His Highness's castle."

"What about the man from before? The knight called Sonny, how is he?"



The other party shrugged his shoulders but did not answer.



Alright, perhaps he did not know, or maybe he did not want to tell me. Primus closed his mouth.



The escort gave him a very strange feeling; he was dressed and looked like an ordinary civilian, but he spoke to the knights without a trace of fear, not even using the most basic honorific. It was as if he did not know that, under normal circumstances, these people could easily decide his life or death.



And then there were his eyes—Primus had seen plenty of civilians who struggled to survive, numb and indifferent, like soulless walking corpses, but in this short man's eyes, he saw pride and dignity, as if he were a civilian with an attitude similar to a knight brimming with honor. This extreme dissonance was very confusing to Primus.



What kind of environment could produce a person like this?



He looked around. Although he had never been to Border Town before, he had heard about this barren and desolate place. But the vitality on display in the town now was completely different from the frontier outpost he had imagined. People bustled about the streets, walking briskly as if they all had endless tasks to attend to. From time to time, someone would even greet the short man escorting him. Everyone's faces were flushed with health and full of vigor, not at all like those who had just endured the hardships of the Evil Months.



As they drew closer to the castle district, he saw an open space where a hundred or so people had gathered—they seemed to be building houses, and judging by the scale, it was not just one building. The materials for the houses were piled up nearby, all made from fired bricks. Usually, only nobles would choose such expensive materials, but if it was said that these were being built for nobles, the houses were too small. The houses that had already been constructed in front of the open space were only slightly larger than his own drawing room. Moreover, the houses were too similar to each other, almost as if they were cast from the same mold; what noble would like such houses?



With all these questions in mind, Primus stepped into the lord's castle.
