## Elk Knight (Part 1)
Pres was locked up here for five days already.

Though it was not a cell, the renovated residence was not much different from a cell—wooden doors had been replaced with wooden railings, and all the furniture in the room had been removed, leaving only a few blankets. The only advantage was that the room was still relatively clean; it was neither drafty nor leaky.

Apart from him, there were four others in the cell. Three of them were from the Rein family, one belonged to the Wolfheart family, and he himself was a knight enfeoffed by the Earl of Elk.

"Damn it, when the hell does he plan to keep us locked up!" A knight from the Rein family, who seemed to be the oldest, complained, "The wheat fields in my domain haven't been sown yet! My wife has no clue how to deal with these things."

"Your domain?" The young knight from the Wolfheart family sneered, "Do you think His Highness the Prince will keep the knight's domains intact for you to return, gather horses, weapons, and armor, and seek revenge when the opportunity arises? Honestly, it's already merciful of him not to have sent all of you to the gallows."

"What did you say!?" The older knight glared at him.

"Just stating the truth," the young knight said nonchalantly, "The Duke is the prime culprit in planning and carrying out the rebellion. It's only natural to clean up his elite knights corps so as not to leave them for his son. As for us, we were forced onto the battlefield due to the Duke's intimidation."

"I think you're asking for death!" He walked over and grabbed the young man, his right fist clenched tight, ready to strike, when a hand reached out from behind and firmly grabbed him.

"Stop it, Harlon. Do you want to attract the guards?" A handsome knight pressed his fist down, "He's not wrong. We are knights under the Duke's command, and we are bound to be severely punished when convicted. Now that it has come to this, it's best to wait quietly for the outcome. Look at the people of Elk family, then look at yourself now. Where is the dignity befitting a noble?"



Pries recognized him, the star knight of Longsong Stronghold, Ferlin Eltek, known as the Morning Light, who had charmed countless young ladies from noble families. Yet, he ended up marrying a commoner, which was quite the scandal at the time. Seeing that he was being addressed, Pries could no longer keep silent and spoke up to the three arguing men: "I'm not sure if we can keep our fiefs, but at least His Highness the Prince won't take your lives."



"Oh? Why is that?"



"Killing at the stronghold could at least serve as a deterrent. Why go through the trouble of bringing you all the way here to kill you? To show his subjects?" Pries shook his head, "The Knights' Order hasn't even set foot in Border Town yet."



Without bursting in and looting and pillaging, the townsfolk naturally wouldn't develop an extreme hatred. Therefore, for the Prince, it made more sense to execute someone as a spectacle for the nobility of the stronghold than for the townspeople. Not having been executed at the stronghold meant their lives were spared.



After thinking it over, Ferlin nodded, "That makes sense. May I ask your name...?"



"Pries Desir."



"Thank you for your reassurance, Sir Desir," Ferlin said with a grateful look, pulling Haron back to sit down in the corner.



The young man also plopped down, leaning against the wall and humming a tune.



He really isn't afraid, Pries thought, while his own 'calmness' was nothing more than a façade.



Press knew in his heart that he wasn't cut out to be a knight. He did not inherit his father's bravery, nor his mother's wisdom; he preferred tending to his own small patch of land over brandishing swords and spears. He would rather raise chickens and ducks, or fish by the pond. Donning armor and wielding a sword to fight for Earl Elk was a reluctant affair—he didn't even enjoy hunting, let alone killing. So during the charge, Press tried to stay as far back as possible, which unexpectedly saved his life.

Wait... As he thought about it, he suddenly found it odd. As the star knight under the duke, why did Finley Silt also survive? Shouldn't he have been at the forefront?



"The prince wants to see you," a guard suddenly shouted at the door, "Seni Dali, you come out first."

The young knight leaped up, waved to everyone, and walked out of the cell.

"Hey, what about us?"

Halon rushed to the door only to be pushed back by the short spear in the guard's hand. After locking the cell door, the guard said coldly, "Don't worry, your turn will come."

Knowing that the trial was imminent, Press became increasingly nervous. Damn it, he had always been looking forward to this day when there were no results, but now that it was coming, he was scared. He thought irritably. Yet his body shook uncontrollably, and every few breaths, he couldn't help but lift his head to glance at the door, just like the first time he faced the imminent birth of his child, with a mix of hope and panic.

Fortunately, the wait wasn't long; after about a quarter of an hour, the guard responsible for the escort came back, "Press Dias, it's your turn."

He stood up in a panic, but his feet got entangled in the blanket on the floor. Luckily, Finley was quick to react and stepped forward to steady him.



"Thank you... thank you." He felt his throat was terribly dry.

"It's nothing." The other person's voice was calm and strong, which greatly eased Prince's tense mood.

He nodded to Phyllis and followed the guard out of the cell.

The guide was a young lad, probably around seventeen years old, dressed in dark brown leather armor and boots, holding a short spear in his hands.

"Do you not need to tie my hands?" Prince asked.

"You were searched before you were locked up, you have no weapons, what could you do?"

"Where are you taking me?"

"To His Highness's castle."

"What about the man before? The knight called Carter, how is he?"



The other party shrugged and did not answer.

Well, perhaps he didn't know, or maybe he just didn't want to tell himself. Pries closed his mouth.

The escort gave him a very strange feeling, dressed and looking like an ordinary civilian, yet he spoke to the knights without a hint of fear, not even using the basic terms of respect. It was as if he didn't know that, under normal circumstances, these people could easily decide his life or death.

And then there was the look in the other's eyes—Pries had seen many civilians who trudged through life for survival, dull and indifferent, like soulless walking corpses, but in the eyes of this short man, he saw pride and self-respect, as if a commoner possessed the demeanor akin to a knight full of honor. This extreme dissonance puzzled Pries.

What kind of environment could have produced such a person?

He looked around. Although he had never been to Border Town before, he had heard about this barren and remote place. However, the vitality on display in the town now was a far cry from the frontier outpost he had imagined. The streets were bustling with people moving quickly, as if they all had endless tasks to do. From time to time, people would greet the short man escorting him. Everyone's faces were ruddy and spirited, not at all like they had just endured the hardships of the Evil Months.

As they neared the castle district, he saw a clearing where over a hundred people seemed to be constructing residences—and judging by the scale, it was more than just one building. The materials for the houses were piled up nearby, all made of fired bricks. Usually, only nobles would choose such relatively expensive materials, but if these were meant for nobles, the houses were too small. The completed houses in front of the clearing were only a bit larger than his own parlor at home. Besides, the houses were too similar to each other, almost as if they were cast from the same mold; which noble would like such houses?

With all these questions in mind, Pries stepped into the lord's castle.
