## Celebration (Part 2)
Six fully preserved oxen were carted to the bonfire—if it weren't for the escort of the militia, Roland suspected that the oxen would be completely divided up by the enthusiastic crowd as the cart passed through.



This was also all the stock in his castle's basement. Thinking that he wouldn't have any steak to eat before the next merchant ship arrived, Roland felt as if he were crying inside. To make this celebration a success, he had really emptied out his coffers.



The royal chefs brought from the capital were only responsible for seasoning and monitoring the cooking temperature; the task of barbecuing was given to six strong men from the militia. An iron rod was inserted into the ox from the mouth, and placed on the brick platform by the fire. The flames blazed, and even from two or three meters away, one could feel the heat wave hitting their face. Soon, the skin of the ox began to sizzle, and the fat oozed from the pores, emitting an enticing aroma.



Of course, while the meat was roasting, Roland didn't want people to wait around doing nothing. At his signal, Iron Axe appeared on the scene with a team of militia members.



The gorgeous and complex court dances were not suitable for such an occasion. Without long periods of training, it was unlikely that people would even remember the steps, let alone display graceful dance moves. If they wanted to ensure simplicity and a full expression of oneself, the dances of the Sand People were obviously more in line with the tastes of the common folk.



Iron Axe and his team members placed their hands on their hips, with one hand passing through the arm of the person on the right, forming a chain of linked arms around the fire pit. They arranged themselves in two circles. As the accompaniment—consisting of several high and low pitch horns—started to sound, they began to move clockwise. With each step they took, they kicked the other foot forward while shouting "Ha, hey!"



"Is this what you call leading the dance?" Carter's eyes widened. "Is this even a dance?"



"Of course, it is. And it's simple and easy to remember. The militia only practiced for a quarter of an hour last night and they've got the steps down," said Roland with a smile. "Would you like to give it a try?"



Carter shook his head, declining the offer. Inside, he felt as though something had shattered with a clang—farewell, the beautiful girl that moved one's heart; farewell, those slightly melancholic memories of youth.



The other militia members began clapping, following the dancer's steps with a clap for every kick. The rhythmic beat energized the crowd, who began to imitate the movements with their hands. As the clapping grew faster, Iron Axe and the team spun with increasing speed, and the circle of people began to break apart. Before long, one of the members fell, causing a domino effect with a group collapsing, bringing the rotation to an abrupt halt. The crowd was stunned, but the militia's applause did not cease; if anything, it became more intense, like a sudden downpour.



Iron Axe helped the fallen member up and shouted to the crowd, "Did everyone see that? Who wants to give it a try? If you fall, that counts as one round! Anyone who joins the dance will get a piece of delicious honey roast meat, and the longer you stay in, the more meat you'll get!"



If it had been an invitation from the nobility or wealthy families, the townspeople might not have been so eager to participate—they subconsciously viewed such people as superior, who often took the peasants for granted and frequently went back on their promises. But seeing the militia members, who were familiar neighbors and fellow villagers, beckoning and encouraging them, one after another couldn't hold back any longer.



With one person taking the lead, it was not long before a second and third joined in. A new round of dancing began, only this time, most of the dancers were from the crowd. Despite the simplicity of the moves, everyone enjoyed themselves, and with honey roast meat as a reward, the participants gave their best performances.



This was exactly the scene Roland had hoped to see.



In addition to roast meat, bread, fish cakes, and barley beer were also distributed after the beef, with the celebration continuing into the night. However, Roland would not stay there the whole time. He had Carter in charge of on-site security and the Assistant Minister to give the closing speech before he left.



He had a private victory banquet to attend, located in the castle's backyard garden.



As evening fell, the backyard remained brightly lit.



Like the town square, a bonfire was lit here as well. The difference was that the chicken meat for roasting was all cut into pieces. The spices and oil were also self-prepared, completely emulating the style of outdoor barbecues. This novel self-service method was irresistible to the witches, and of course, in Roland's eyes, it was equally a rare and wonderful sight—for instance, Anna would coat the chicken pieces with spices and then wrap them in green flames, instantly producing a fragrant piece of chicken. Nightingale demonstrated her incredible knife skills, with the dining knife appearing and disappearing in her hands, flipping over and around the chicken, and after peeling, the bones would fall off neatly.



Of course, there was also wine. These bottled wines brought over from Willow Town were obviously more suited to the taste of women than ale. Lightning had drunk half a bottle by herself. Although Roland wanted to say that underage drinking was prohibited, she was floating in mid-air with the wine bottle, making it difficult to dissuade her. After some thought, he let it be.



Halfway through the barbecue, Roland began to feel slightly intoxicated. He leaned back in his chair, looking at the group of cheerful and laughing girls before him, and felt immensely comforted. This is the life a prince should have, he thought, and the same goes for the witches. With their extraordinary abilities and looks, they should not be hunted but rather be the dazzling center of attention wherever they would go if it were the era before he was transported to this world. All he could do now was to provide a small sanctuary where they could live like normal people.



Just then, Lightning floated down and sat directly on Roland's lap, planting a kiss on his cheek before he could react.



Despite the swift action, the other witches caught it.



She flew away with a giggle, seeing the astonished looks on Anna, Nightingale, and Wendy's faces, she waved her hand to explain, "According to the customs of the Fjords, during a victory celebration, a woman can take the initiative to kiss the leader. My dad always lets me kiss him. Doesn't Graycastle have this tradition?"



"Of course not," Roland's tipsiness cleared up significantly, "Er... *cough* Lightning, you're drunk. Go back and sleep it off now!"



"How could that be," protested Lightning, "I often compete in drinking with everyone when sailing, and I've never lost."



Roland had no choice but to look to the witches for help. He looked at Wendy, who nodded and conjured a downward gust of wind, blowing Lightning down. Just before she hit the ground, Wendy stepped forward and caught the girl, ignoring her protests as she carried her straight towards the castle.



"Don't mind her, she's just drunk. You all keep eating, there's dessert coming later." Roland suddenly felt the atmosphere turn awkward, especially with the way Anna was looking at him, which sent a chill up his spine. The only one unaffected was Nana, who was still focused on grilling her chicken wings, as if nothing had happened.



As the bonfire gradually extinguished, Roland asked Nightingale to escort Nana home, while he himself went to the well to splash his face with cold water, also preparing to return to his room to sleep. This minor incident wasn't something Roland dwelled on; in his view, Lightning was still just a minor.



However, when he reached the door of his bedroom on the third floor, the prince's heart gave a sudden leap.



He saw Anna leaning against the door.
