## Ashes (Part 1)
The people who had come were all witches, Theo had not lied. Ashes could feel the magic power nurtured inside of them, and could roughly distinguish their strength—especially so for the leader in front of her, whose magic power was like a sharp dagger, causing a faint pain just by focusing on feeling it.



"My name is Ashes, I'm glad to meet you, sisters of the Witch Cooperation Association." She placed her greatsword aside and stepped forward to embrace each of the four witches... No, she thought, there should be five. Ashes raised her head, gazing at the black dot circling in the sky, "Isn't she coming down?"



"She's guiding us," the leader said with a smile, "I am Nightingale," then she pointed to the other three witches, "Scroll, Leaf, and Echo." Lastly, she pursed her lips towards the sky, "That little girl is Lightning."



Ashes looked at Scroll and paused, the magic power inside of her was very weak, spreading throughout her body like mist, which greatly surprised her, "An Extraordinary?"



Nightingale also looked somewhat surprised, "You can see magic power?"



"Not see, but feel," Ashes explained, "Extraordinaries can perceive the form and flow of magic power because their bodies have been transformed by it. I think this sister must have the same sensation."



Scroll nodded with a smile, "Indeed, it has helped me find many companions in the vast sea of people."



"Are Extraordinaries very rare?" Nightingale asked.



The other party was first concerned about the number, not 'what is an Extraordinary'... Ashes thought secretly, could it be that the Witch Cooperation Association had also heard of the existence of Extraordinary witches? This is a closely guarded secret by the Church, because the abilities of Extraordinary witches act directly upon themselves, unrestrained by the God's Punishment Stones, and any exposed Extraordinary is the Church's number one enemy.



"Among thousands of witches, only one extraordinary person would appear," she thought to herself, her expression remaining unchanged, "So far, among my fellow witches I have met, including Scroll, there are only three." Ashes paused for a moment, "Right, I remember the leader of the Witch Cooperation Association seems to be called Cara, is she doing well?"



"She's dead," Nightingale shook her head, "She died on the way to find the Holy Mountain."



"...That's regrettable news," Ashes lowered her voice, but what made her somewhat concerned was that the other party did not show too much sorrow when discussing this issue, "Then who is your new leader now?"



"Let's go back to Border Town and talk about it slowly," she smiled, "You will meet him soon."



...



After entering the town, Ashes noticed something amiss. These Witch Cooperation Association witches were actually holding torches, walking openly in the streets. Moreover, even after nightfall, the town was not dead silent; many houses' paper windows revealed faint light from fires, and if one listened carefully, there were also bursts of children's reading voices.



Candles, although not too expensive, are sparingly used by commoners due to limited savings and are not easily lit unless necessary. The fact that so many households in the town were lighting candles at night was an unbelievable sight, and with the reading voices pronouncing words one by one, could it be that they were teaching children to read?



But since the other party didn't mention it, she didn't bother to ask either. After all, this place was not for a long stay, what she needed to do was to quickly lead everyone away.



Passing through the crisscrossing streets, the group was getting closer to the castle district, and Ashes could already see the dark walls and the guards standing watch in the night. "Where are we going?" she couldn't help but ask.



"Border Town Castle, we're almost there," Nightingale answered her.



"Wait," she couldn't help slowing down her pace, "that's where the lord resides, isn't it?"



"Yes, and it's also the home of the witches."



"Did you reach an agreement with the lord?" Ashes frowned. Even if the Witch Cooperation Association had strong local forces, it would be difficult to confront the lord with God's Punishment Stones and the Church head-on. Therefore, the only possibility was cooperation — which was also one of the survival paths some witches had explored. Unfortunately, faced with the disadvantaged witch community, most lords were unwilling to sit down and discuss terms fairly. Instead, they constantly exploited and demanded more, and so this path was quickly blocked.



"Sort of," Nightingale's tone didn't carry much of the bitterness of oppression, but rather seemed to enjoy it, "At least we have all signed contracts with His Highness."



Ashes, however, could not feel happy for them. Contracts, those things written on paper, were hardly binding. When the lords got tired of giving or wanted to terminate the equal relationship, they just needed to crumple it up and throw it into the fireplace. No one would speak up for the witches. Their status was like a lone boat in the sea, always at risk of capsizing.



Fortunately, she had come. She thought of taking them away from here, to the other side of the sea. There, the witches had built their own haven, far from the threat of the Church and the secular world.



As they passed through the castle gate, the guards indeed seemed accustomed to the presence of witches and even greeted each other.



Compared to the palace in the royal capital, the lord's castle here was no doubt much smaller and darker. Only a few lonely torches hung on the walls of the corridor, and their flickering light couldn't cover the entire stone floor, which made walking through feel somewhat oppressive. It wasn't until they entered the reception hall that the light suddenly brightened.



In the hall, Ashes saw more witches who seemed to have been waiting there for a long time. Upon her arrival, they all applauded to welcome her. Nightingale stepped forward to make a brief introduction when suddenly, a witch rushed over.



"Wendy!" someone called out.



Ashes noticed the other's approach but did not take any countermeasures—she could feel the other's surprise and joy, but no hostility. Soon, a warm body embraced her.



"You actually survived," the other's voice was full of excitement, "Thank you for saving me back then."



Ashes was taken aback, "You are..."



"My name is Wendy," she released her arms, looking directly into Ashes' eyes, "the little girl from the choir. Do you remember me?"



...

In the bedroom on the second floor, only Ashes and Wendy were left.



She did not expect to encounter a companion from the convent here.



"Partner might be a bit of a stretch. If it hadn't been for that night, I would never have crossed paths with Wendy. In fact, I didn't even notice that in the underground room where I was forcibly taken, there was another unfortunate soul just like me. I would never have imagined that she, too, would end up becoming a witch."



"After I fled the monastery, I settled down in the Fjords," Wendy finally spoke after a long silence. "Later, I heard that there seemed to have been a big fire at the monastery that day, and the whereabouts of the children inside were unknown."



"A fire?" Ashes shook her head. "That was the doing of the church itself, to cover up the scandal. I killed some of the managers and the Judgment Army that tried to stop me, until... the God's Punishment Army arrived. The scar on my eye is what they left behind. If I hadn't made the split-second decision to run away, by the time the rest of the God's Punishment Army showed up, I'm afraid I would have died there."



"God's Punishment Army..." Wendy repeated, her eyes widening. "What is that?"
