## Ashes (Part 1)
The people who came were all witches, Tassa hadn't lied, Ashes could feel the magic nurtured within them, and she could roughly distinguish their strengths—the leader in front of her especially so, her magic was like a sharp dagger, focusing on it alone would make one feel a faint pain.

"My name is Ashes, it's a pleasure to meet you, sisters of the Union," she placed her greatsword aside and stepped forward to hug each of the four witches... no, she thought, there should be five. Ashes lifted her head, staring at the black dot circling in the sky, "Isn't she coming down?"

"She is guiding us," the leader said with a smile, "I am Nightingale," then she pointed to the other three witches, "Scroll, Leaf, and Echo." Lastly, she pursed her lips towards the sky, "That little girl is Lightning."

Ashes was taken aback as she looked at Scroll, the touch of magic within her was extremely faint, spread throughout her body like mist, this sensation surprised her, "Extraordinary?"

Nightingale's expression also seemed somewhat surprised, "You can see magic?"

"Not see, feel," Ashes explained, "Extraordinaries can perceive the shape and flow of magic because their bodies have been transformed by it, I think this sister must share the same sensation."

Scroll nodded with a smile, "Indeed, it has helped me find many companions in the vast sea of people."

"Are Extraordinaries rare?" Nightingale asked.

The other party first focused on the number, not 'what is an Extraordinary'... Ashes thought to herself, could it be that the Union had also heard of the existence of extraordinary witches? This was a secret strictly forbidden by the Church, as the abilities of extraordinary witches act directly upon themselves, unrestrained by the Divine Stone of Judgement, any exposed Extraordinary was a prime enemy of the Church.

"Only one extraordinary witch might appear among thousands," she mused while maintaining her composure, "and including Scroll, I've only met three among my kin." Ashes paused for a moment, "Right, I remember the leader of the Witch Union was called Cara, is she doing well?"

"She's dead," Nightingale shook her head, "She died on the journey to find the Holy Mountain."

"...That is regrettable news," Ashes said in a low voice, but what caught her attention was that the other party did not seem too sentimental when discussing the matter, "Then who is the new leader of your group now?"

"We'll talk more once we get back to Border Town," she smiled, "You'll meet him soon enough."

...

Upon entering the town, Ashes noticed that something was amiss. These Witch Union members were boldly walking down the streets with torches in hand. Moreover, even after nightfall, the town was not dead silent; the faint light of fire twinkled through the windows of many houses, and if one listened carefully, there were bursts of children's reading voices.

Candles, though not extremely expensive, were a luxury that commoners with limited savings would not use lightly. The fact that so many households had lit candles at night was an unbelievable sight, and the sound of reading word by word—could it be that they were teaching children to read?

However, since the other party did not bring it up, she did not bother to ask. After all, this was not a place to stay for long. What she needed to do was to quickly lead everyone away.

As they passed through the crisscrossing streets, the group approached the castle area, and Ashes could already see the dark walls and the guards on duty under the night sky. "Where are we going?" she couldn't help but ask.

"Border Town Castle, we're almost there," Nightingale replied to her.
"Wait," she couldn't help but slow her steps, "that's where the lord lives, right?"
"Yes, it's also home for the witches."
"Did you reach an agreement with the lord?" Ashes frowned. Even if the Witch Cooperation Association had strong local influence, it was difficult to confront a lord with a Divine Stone of Judgement and the church head-on. Therefore, the only possibility was collaboration — a path some witches explored to survive. Unfortunately, facing the disadvantaged witch community, most lords were unwilling to sit down and negotiate on fair terms. Instead, they would endlessly exploit and demand, quickly blocking that path.
"Sort of," Nightingale said without a hint of oppression in her tone, seemingly enjoying the situation, "at least we all have contracts with His Highness."
Ashes, however, could not feel happy for them. Contracts, those written on paper, had no binding force. When the lord grew tired of fulfilling his obligations or wanted to end the equal relationship, he could simply crumple it up and throw it into the fireplace. No one would stand up for the witches; their status was like a lone boat in the ocean, always at risk of capsizing.
Fortunately, I am here, she thought, planning to take them away from here, across the sea. There was a homeland built by witches themselves, far from the threat of the church and the secular world.
Passing through the castle gate, the guards seemed quite accustomed to the presence of witches and even exchanged greetings.
Compared to the palace in the capital, the lord's castle here was undoubtedly smaller and darker. Only a few lonely torches hung on the walls of the corridor, and the flickering light couldn't cover the entire stone floor, making the atmosphere somewhat oppressive. It wasn't until they entered the parlor that the light suddenly brightened.

In the hall, Ashes saw more witches who seemed to have been waiting there for a long time. Upon her arrival, they all started clapping to welcome her. Nightingale stepped forward to make introductions, but before she could start, a witch suddenly rushed over.

"Wendy!" someone called out.

Ashes noticed the other's actions but did not take any countermeasures—she could feel the other's surprise and joy, but there was no hostility. Soon, a warm body embraced her.

"You actually survived," the other's voice was full of excitement, "Thank you for saving me back then."

Ashes was taken aback, "You are..."

"My name is Wendy," she released her arms, looking directly into Ashes' eyes, "the little girl from the choir. Do you remember me?"

...

In the bedroom on the second floor, only Ashes and Wendy were left.

She never expected to encounter a companion from the convent here.

Saying that we were partners would be somewhat of a stretch. If it hadn't been for that night, I would never have come into contact with Wendy. In fact, at that time, I didn't even notice that there was another unfortunate soul, like me, who had been forcefully taken into that underground room. I would have never imagined that she would end up becoming a witch as well.
"After I escaped from the monastery, I settled down in Sea Breeze County," Wendy finally spoke after a long silence. "Later, I learned that there seemed to be a big fire at the monastery that day, and the whereabouts of the children there became unknown."
"A fire?" Ashes shook her head. "That was done by the Church themselves to cover up the scandal. I killed some of the administrators and the Judgement Army who tried to stop me, until... the God's Punishment Army arrived. The scar on my eye was left by them. If I hadn't made the split-second decision to run away, I would have probably died there when the rest of the God's Punishment Army arrived."
"The God's Punishment Army..." Wendy repeated, her eyes widening. "What is that?"
