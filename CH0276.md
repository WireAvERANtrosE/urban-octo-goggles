## New Cannon Development
Lucia carried the ore to see His Highness the Prince, and the words of Nightingale still echoed in her ears.



She had to admit, she was shaken by the frankness Nightingale had shown.



Although she didn't quite understand matters of the heart, a witch and a prince... couldn't possibly end up together, right? Shouldn't she keep her feelings hidden carefully within her heart, so as not to let the other person know?



And why did she, even just as a listener, feel her face flush and feel extremely embarrassed?



Standing in front of the office door, she took a deep breath and pushed the door open.



"Your Highness, I've brought the ore."



"Let's have a look," Roland yawned.



The ruler of Border Town looked just as usual, sleepy-eyed which probably meant he had just woken up from a nap not long ago. He leaned back in his chair, his demeanor natural, his tone easygoing, nothing like the sharpness of other nobles.



Lucia's inexplicably nervous mood also relaxed considerably. She took out the ore particles that had been discovered in the North Slope Mine from her pouch and placed them one by one on the office desk.



After the ability decomposition, these particles all looked more or less the same, either silvery-white or grayish-white in color. Perhaps only the erudite His Highness could discern what kind of ore this was.



The Prince furrowed his brow and examined them for a while, weighing each in his palm, then scrutinizing them against the sunlight from behind, and finally waved his hand, "Cough cough, I'll entrust these ores to Mr. Steuer for identification. You continue practicing your abilities in the backyard of the northern slope, and if you don't understand something, consult Anna."



"..." Eh, even His Highness doesn't recognize them? Lucia quickly bowed her head and said, "Yes."



As she was about to leave the office, Roland called out to her.



"By the way, you did well on the test this time, scoring sixty-eight points and ranking ninth. It's not easy to achieve such performance after only a month of studying with everyone; you should keep it up. Also..." he paused, "next time, I hope that Bell can participate in the test with everyone."



"Yes!" Lucia responded excitedly.



...



Watching the young girl leave the office with a happy bow, Roland sighed while looking at the metal particles on the table.



He was still too naive, having fully expected that after decomposing them into elements, he might be able to grasp which veins were embedded in the northern slope mine. However, reality made him realize the huge chasm between mechanical engineering and geology—these stones would ultimately differentiate into three to four types of metals, with the most abundant pile considered to be the ore of that metal. But they were almost indistinguishable in color and shape. For example, iron, aluminum, magnesium, and potassium are all silvery-white metals when in a high state of purity, and trying to identify them by sight was overly difficult.



Let's leave this problem to the Chief Alchemist to solve. After all, verifying the properties of materials through chemical reactions is much more reliable than guessing blindly.



After dealing with this matter, Roland took out a piece of paper and began planning how to cope with this year's Evil Months.



With summer coming to an end, the three months of autumn would be his last preparation time. In addition to defending against the demonic beasts invading from the west, he also had to be vigilant of Timothy and the Church to the east. Unlike the previous year when he was stretched thin, now the population and income under his rule had both increased significantly, iron-smelting output was gradually climbing, and the number of witches had increased by more than a dozen. He was fully confident in turning the Western Territory into an impregnable wall of copper and iron.



Based on last year's combat experience, the biggest threat to the city walls was undoubtedly the hybrid demonic beasts, especially when the enemy possessed thick carapaces impervious to bullets. One either had to get close to use explosive packs or send witches out of the city to fight. Regardless of the strategy, the risks would be greatly increased.



Additionally, most of his human enemies consisted of cavalry and infantry, and they had yet to witness the siege weapons of this era. If the enemy were able to set up torsion catapults or even more advanced counterweight trebuchets, he would likely encounter significant trouble—after all, muzzle-loading cannons were very inconvenient to fire downward, as they needed to be raised for each reload, and the cannonballs could easily roll out of the barrel.



Developing a more powerful cannon was imperative.



Roland pondered, listing the specifications he needed on the paper.



Firstly, it should have enough range and power to penetrate the carapaces of hybrid demonic beasts from a kilometer away. Secondly, it must use breech-loading ammunition, allowing for the freedom to adjust the firing angle, and possess the capability for rapid firing. Lastly, to reduce the time spent on repeated research and development, the design should consider multiple uses—one could use it as a fixed battery to suppress the enemy or directly mount it on a ship to serve as the main weapon for future shallow-water heavy gunboats.



Therefore, it should be a large-caliber, long-barreled heavy cannon.



Roland first thought of those massive fifteen or sixteen-inch guns on battleships, with ranges of tens of kilometers, a single shot capable of blasting several meters deep into the ground. But he quickly dismissed this impractical idea. While there were no issues with the manufacturing process, with the current material level of Border Town, at least nine out of ten cannons would burst upon firing. Even if the barrel walls were thickened to over a meter, the resulting weapon would be impractical due to its immobility.



For now, he could only produce high-purity pig iron and ordinary steel, so it was best to keep the plans conservative.



Roland eventually settled on the "sacred number" of one hundred fifty-two millimeters for the caliber.



The cannon would use a vertical sliding wedge breech, similar to a door that could slide up and down. When lowered, it exposed the bore for loading shells, and when raised back into place, it locked, channeling the burning powder gases forward. Compared to the screw and horizontal sliding wedge breeches, this one had the fastest firing rate and the principle behind it was quite simple; its mechanical structure was something he was thoroughly familiar with.



However, to achieve rapid firing, the cannon also needed a recoil and recuperator mechanism. Simply put, it was like two bicycle pumps, one filled with oil and the other with a recuperator spring or gas. When the cannon recoiled, it pulled the connecting rods of both cylinders, compressing both the oil and the recuperator mechanism. The oil was used to cushion the recoil, while the recuperator spring stored energy to push the barrel back into place after firing.



Then came the shells.



Since they were using the Sacred Gun, they could no longer be satisfied with mere solid iron balls and paper cartridge buckshot—out of caution, Roland decided to develop two types of fixed ammunition. One was an enlarged version of a bullet, with a solid metal head; the other was an explosive head with a triggering fuse, which was the howitzer shell of later times. Since the latter presented certain technical difficulties, requiring repeated testing of the fuse's reliability, there was no guarantee it could be equipped to the troops before the Evil Months. Therefore, it was necessary to first produce the former to address the issue of availability. Even with solid heads, it was easy to deal with slow-moving armored demonic beasts and stationary siege equipment.



Of course, both types of shells would require a large amount of smokeless powder. Without large-scale production of double-base powder, the new artillery could only be used as a special weapon, and it was impossible to achieve a satisfying barrage of cannon fire.



Just then, a personal guard entered through the door.



"Your Highness, there is a secret letter from the capital."

Roland put down the quill and opened the envelope. The letter was unsigned and the handwriting was unfamiliar, but the content, consisting of just one sentence, undoubtedly indicated that it was sent by Theo.

"A troop of about a thousand men left the capital today, heading towards the Western Territory."
