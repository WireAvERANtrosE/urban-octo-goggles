## New Firearm Development
Lucia, carrying the ore on her way to see His Highness the prince, still had Nightingale's words echoing in her ears.

She had to admit that she was shocked by the straightforward attitude that the other party had revealed.

Although she didn't quite understand the matter of feelings, a witch and a prince... surely they couldn't possibly be together, right? In that case, shouldn't one keep their thoughts carefully hidden in their heart, so as not to let the other person know?

And why did she, even as a listener, feel her face burning and utterly embarrassed?

Standing at the door of the office, Lucia took a deep breath and pushed the door open.

"Your Highness, I have brought the ore."

"Let me have a look," Roland yawned.

The ruler of Border Town looked just as usual, his sleepy eyes probably indicating that he had just woken up from a nap not long ago. He leaned back in his chair with a casual demeanor and a relaxed tone, nothing like the sharpness of other nobles.

Lucia's inexplicably tense mood also relaxed quite a bit, and she took out the ore particles found in the North Slope Mine from her pouch and laid them out one by one on the office desk.



After the ability analysis, these particles all looked quite similar, either silvery-white or grayish-white in color. Perhaps only the erudite Prince could discern what kind of ore these actually were.

The Prince frowned and examined them for a long time, weighing each in his palm and scrutinizing them against the sunlight behind him. Finally, he waved his hand and said, "Cough cough, I will have Mr. Scroll identify these ores. You continue practicing your abilities in the backyard of the North Slope, and if you don't understand something, ask Anna for help."

"..." Eh, even His Highness doesn't recognize them? Lucia quickly bowed her head and said, "Yes."

Just as she was about to leave the office, Roland called out to her again.

"By the way, you did well on the test this time, scoring sixty-eight and ranking ninth. It's not easy to achieve such a performance after only a month of studying with everyone. You must keep it up. Also..." He paused, "Next time, I hope that Bell can also participate in the test with everyone."

"Yes!" Lucia responded excitedly.

...

Watching the little girl bow happily and leave, Roland sighed as he looked at the metal particles on the table.

He had been too naive, thinking that after breaking them down into elements, he might be able to figure out exactly which ore veins were contained within the North Slope mine. However, reality made him realize the immense gap between mechanical engineering and geology—these stones would ultimately differentiate into three to four types of metals, with the most abundant pile considered the ore for that metal. However, in terms of color and shape, they were almost indistinguishable. For example, iron, aluminum, magnesium, and potassium are all silvery-white metals in a high state of purity, making it exceedingly difficult to identify them by sight alone.



Still, it's better to leave this problem to the Chief Alchemist to solve. After all, verifying material properties through chemical reactions is much more reliable than guessing on my own.

After dealing with this matter, Roland took out a piece of paper and began planning how to deal with this year's Evil Months.

With summer coming to an end, the three months of autumn were his last preparation time. In addition to defending against the demonic beasts invading from the west, he also had to be mindful of Timothy and the Church to the east. Unlike the previous year when resources were stretched thin, the population and income under his rule had grown significantly, iron smelting output was gradually increasing, and the number of witches had grown by over a dozen. He was fully confident in turning the Western Territory into an insurmountable wall of bronze and iron.

Based on last year's combat experience, the biggest threat to the city walls was undoubtedly the mixed-breed demonic beasts, especially when the enemy possessed thick shells that bullets could not penetrate. The options were either to approach and use explosive packs or to send witches out of the city to fight. Both strategies significantly increased the risk.

Additionally, the human enemies he faced were mostly cavalry and infantry, and he had yet to see siege weapons from this era. If the enemy could set up torsion trebuchets, or even more advanced counterweight trebuchets, he might run into serious trouble—after all, it was very inconvenient to fire downward with muzzle-loading cannons, which required raising the barrel after each loading, and the cannonballs were prone to rolling out of the bore.

It was imperative to develop a more powerful cannon.

Roland pondered and listed the necessary specifications on the paper.

Firstly, it should have enough range and power to penetrate the shells of mixed-breed demonic beasts from a thousand meters away. Secondly, it must be a breech-loading weapon, capable of freely adjusting the elevation angle and possessing the ability to fire rapidly. Lastly, to reduce the time spent on repeated research and development, it should be considered for multiple uses in the design—both as a fixed battery to suppress the enemy and as a main weapon that can be directly mounted on ships for future gunboats in shallow waters.

Therefore, it should be a large-caliber, long-barreled heavy cannon.



Roland first thought of those colossal fifteen or sixteen-inch battleship guns with ranges spanning tens of kilometers, capable of creating several-meter-deep craters with a single shot. However, he quickly dismissed this impractical idea. Although there were no issues with processing, with the current material capabilities of Border Town, at least nine out of ten cannons would explode upon firing. Even if he were to thicken the barrel walls to over a meter, the resulting weapon would be rendered impractical due to its immovability.



At present, he could only produce high-purity pig iron and steel of average quality, so it was better to be conservative in his approach.



Roland eventually settled on the "sacred number" of 152 millimeters for the caliber.



The cannon would use a sliding-wedge breech, similar to a vertically moving door that, when lowered, would expose the bore for loading the shell. Once raised back into place, it would lock, channeling the explosive force of the gunpowder gas forward. Compared to screw breeches and horizontal sliding wedges, its firing speed was the fastest, and the principle was quite simple; its mechanical structure was already well known to him.



However, to achieve rapid firing, the cannon also needed a recoil and counter-recoil system, which was essentially like two pumps: one filled with hydraulic fluid and the other with a return spring or gas. When the cannon recoiled, it would pull the connecting rods of both cylinders, compressing both the fluid and the return mechanism. The hydraulic fluid served to cushion the recoil, while the return spring stored energy to push the barrel back into position after firing.



Then there was the matter of the shells.



Having adopted the Sacred Church's cannon, Roland could not be satisfied with crude solid iron balls or paper shrapnel shots. For prudence, he decided to develop two types of fixed ammunition. One was an enlarged version of a bullet with a solid metal head; the other was an explosive shell with a trigger fuse, akin to the later howitzer shells. Since the latter presented certain technical difficulties and required repeated testing of the fuse's reliability, it was not guaranteed to be equipped with troops before the Evil Months, making it essential to produce the former first to address the immediate need. Even with solid heads, it was easy to deal with slow-moving, heavily armored demonic beasts and fixed siege engines.



Of course, regardless of the type of shell, a large amount of smokeless powder would be needed. Until nitro compounds were produced on a large scale, the new cannons could only serve as special weapons, and achieving a satisfying barrage of cannon fire was not possible.



It was at this moment that a personal guard entered through the door.



"Your Highness, there is a secret letter from the capital."

Roland set down his quill and opened the envelope. There was no signature on the letter from beginning to end, and the handwriting was very unfamiliar, but the content of just one sentence made it clear that this letter was undoubtedly sent by Tassa.

"A troop of around a thousand men left the capital today, heading towards the Western Territory."
