## Under the Night Curtain
The newcomers numbered about fifty, all clad in armor that shone brightly under the sun. Among the four flags in the troop, three bore the symbol of the Greycastle royal family, the double-spear high tower flag, and there was also a high tower with a horse's head flag. After pondering for a moment, he recognized it as the emblem of the Northern Honeysuckle Family.



One of the knights stepped forward and shouted, "I am Rayman Honeysuckle, an envoy of King Timothy. I have brought the royal decree from the capital. Please lower the drawbridge."



"Your proof?" Peter leaned out and called loudly.



The other party took off the bow and arrow from his back, tied a scroll to the arrow, and shot it straight up to the battlements.



The guard by his side immediately picked up the arrow for him. Peter unrolled the parchment to see that beneath the text, there were interwoven threads of gold, and in the bottom right corner was the seal of the Wimbledon royal family. It was indeed the new king's envoy, no mistake about it.



"Lower the bridge, open the gate," Peter took a deep breath, having already guessed the content of the so-called royal decree—it most likely had to do with Roland Wimbledon. Since the other party was not an imposter, he had no reason to turn away the new king's envoy. Otherwise, it would be tantamount to making an enemy of the Greycastle capital. Once this news spread, the other major families would undoubtedly point their spears at the Honeysuckle territory without hesitation, and the undercurrents that had been suppressed within the city would rebound in an instant.



However, the fact that Timothy had sent only a fifty-man envoy to inquire about the situation also confirmed the Fourth Prince's words—the new king might not have the time to manage the Western Territory right now.



Since His Highness the Prince could repel an alliance army of more than a thousand soldiers, these fifty men would probably also return without success.



Of course, this news still needed to be communicated to Prince Roland as soon as possible.



Thinking of this, he called over the knight from before, "Westron, take three short-tailed horses with you, change mounts along the way, and deliver this message to the Lord of Border Town as fast as possible. Tell him that Timothy's forces have arrived."

"Understood," Westron nodded.

Watching the knight turn and leave, Peter sighed, "Let's go down to greet the new king's envoy."

...

It was only when he stood at the city gate that he noticed, apart from the ten or so people at the front of the group who seemed spirited, the rest of the knights looked somewhat listless, hunched over on their horses as if they could fall down at any moment.

"Hello, Sir Rayman," Peter nodded in greeting, "I am the administrator of the stronghold, Peter·Helmann of the Honeysuckle family."

The term 'stronghold administrator' left a bitter taste in his mouth. If he truly were the duke in charge of the Western Region, the stronghold's duke, he would not have to salute the envoy, nor would he need to greet him at the gate. He could just stay in the lord's castle and wait for the other party to seek an audience.

"I have heard your name back at Coldwind Ridge, 'Acting Duke'," Rayman dismounted and walked over with a smile, "Your Western Region really is a peculiar place, Duke Lion amassed a large army yet failed to take down a small town, and instead lost his own life. Such a thing is not common in Greycastle. Of course, this might be good news for the Honeysuckles."

Peter automatically ignored the sarcasm in his words, "How are your men? They seem a bit... uncomfortable."



"Don't worry about them," Raymond glanced back, "They're probably just exhausted from the journey and not accustomed to the local climate. They'll recover after some rest. To be honest, this place is too hot."



"It's the North that's too cold," Since the other party didn't care, Peter also didn't bother to continue on the topic, "I'm very curious why His Majesty's envoy would set out from Coldwind Ridge, instead of coming from the capital."



"Because His Majesty Timothy is currently in the Northern Territory," he said frankly, "Duke Ryan took advantage of the moment when the Border Guards were at their weakest to create an uprising in the North, suspected of rebellion, and the King had no choice but to send troops to suppress it."



Rebellion? Peter frowned, this didn't make sense. The Border Guards consisted of knights and mercenaries from all over Greycastle, but the majority were still Duke Ryan's own men. Why would there be a rebellion when his own forces had suffered heavy losses? Recalling the letter from Duke Lion, who had planned to take advantage of the situation to annex the North, a bad premonition rose in his heart... Could it be that Timothy Wimbledon harbored the same intentions?



"So what is the capital's decision?"



"A recall order," Raymond said, "His Majesty sent me here precisely because he doesn't want to see the Western Territory fall into chaos as well. If I recall correctly, as early as the Evil Months, His Majesty had already sent a recall order to Roland Wimbledon, but he still hasn't returned to the capital."



"The document should have arrived at the stronghold about five months ago, but unlike the other lords in previous years, Prince Roland did not return to the stronghold to take refuge before the Evil Months," Peter paused, "At that time, he was in Border Town leading his people to resist the demonic beasts' invasion and couldn't immediately start his journey back to the capital."



"Now that the Evil Months have been over for nearly three months," Raymond said incontrovertibly, "the King has sent me to escort him back to the capital."



"When do you plan to head to Border Town?"



"Set off first thing tomorrow morning."

Under normal circumstances, it would take three days to reach the town, but the knights dispatched by himself could deliver the message in a day and a night if they rode without stopping. This way, Prince Roland should be able to make the necessary preparations. Peter thought that this was all he could do.



Bringing the delegation to the stronghold camp, he stopped and said, "This place used to be the station for the Duke's Knight Order. You all should rest here for the night, and dinner will be delivered to you. As for you, Sir Messenger," he turned to Rayman Huss, "the castle will host a grand dinner for you, please be sure to attend."



"Thank you for your generosity, Sir Peter," the latter replied with a smile.



...



After the dinner, Rayman returned to the camp and entered the central large tent, where several of his subordinates immediately surrounded him.



"What's the situation?" he asked.



"There are people watching us from all around, and there's a troop of nearly a hundred men stationed at the exit. However, most of them don't have full armor. They seem to be the city patrol," one reported. "It seems that the lord does not trust us."



"At least the information is correct. The news I gathered from the banquet also confirms this," Rayman said in a low voice. "After the defeat of the Duke, most of the knights were captured and taken to Border Town, and there aren't many elite soldiers left in the stronghold that can be used for combat."



Before arriving here, he had already thoroughly understood the situation of Longsong Stronghold. The task given to him by His Majesty Timothy was quite simple: to find out the reasons behind the Duke's failure and then take corresponding measures to seize control of the Western Territory as soon as possible.

"How are those who have taken the medicine... their condition?"

"They're almost at their limit," another person replied, "Now, as long as they are given the pills, they are willing to do anything."

The envoy group was merely a front, a team of fifty people, with only thirteen true knights among them; the rest were mercenaries disguised as knights. Under the influence of the Church's pills, they were now more obedient than hounds and more ferocious than demonic beasts. This was key to Raymond's plan to take over the city gates. According to the plan, another militia force of fifteen hundred was slowly approaching the stronghold. As soon as the city gates were opened, the city would fall into their hands.

"Distribute the pills, leave ten to deal with the patrol team, and the rest head towards the east gate," he ordered.
