## Means of Transportation
Roland leaned back in his office chair, carefully examining the statistical report prepared by Barov.

It had taken the city hall three full days to sort through all the more than six thousand refugees. The proportion of craftsmen was low, and in the end, only one hundred and eighty-six were approved. Of course, this was related to the strictness of the review—since it involved the allocation of housing and the issuance of identity cards.

In Roland's view, in the future, only residents with identity cards would be considered his official subjects. Therefore, it was crucial to maintain strict checks and cultivate the town's core supporters while the population was still manageable. As the population grew, he would use the power of the people to assimilate other newcomers—after all, humans are social animals. As long as the environment was conducive, more and more people would agree with his philosophy, and he indeed could offer his subjects a better life.

"Then leave the housing arrangements for these craftsmen to you. Whether they are single or have families, each should be allocated at least one separate suite," Roland instructed.

"Yes," Barov replied, "Your Highness, are these houses to be distributed as gifts?"

"Consider it as a rental," he shook his head, "The native residents get the new community houses for free because most of them already have old homes—it's like exchanging old houses for new ones. But if we also give these houses to the newcomers, it won't be conducive to getting them to leave their homes and actively throw themselves into their work. Of course, the rent can be set at a lower rate, and tell them that as long as they work hard and save up enough gold royals, they can buy the houses outright."

"I understand."

After a moment of silence, Roland suddenly asked, "How many deserters have there been since the knighting ceremony?"

"Up to today, not a single one among the original residents, seven among the serfs," Barov paused, "There are more from the refugees from the Eastern Region, a total of one hundred and fifteen people."



"Is that so." He sighed softly, knowing the moment he decided to bring the witch to the forefront, such a situation would occur. To assess public reaction and prevent accidents, Roland had specifically arranged for a squad of musketeers to be stationed a few miles away from the town, intercepting these escapees while tallying their numbers to gauge everyone's acceptance of witches.

And the answer, while not perfect, was at least very good—the natives had completely accepted the witches, which was close to what he had predicted. The number of serfs who fled was less than estimated, suggesting that the drama performances close to the grassroots level were effective. However, it was the refugees from the Eastern Region who, despite having been treated by witches and being in a situation where their homes were destroyed and they had nowhere to go, still saw over a hundred people choosing to leave, which slightly surprised Roland.



"Your Highness, I suggest that they all be executed," Barov said calmly, "Those who are determined to leave under such circumstances must be deeply influenced by the Church. It's foreseeable that they will not stand with the royal authority in the future; they will most likely turn into followers of the Church, and there's no need for mercy towards them."



"Not necessarily..." the prince closed his eyes and said, "Those who are truly devout to the Church are likely the more than three hundred refugees who were unwilling to leave the capital even in the face of the demonic plague. Perhaps these people are simply unable to change their own beliefs, stubbornly considering witches to be evil, and wish to escape from this place."



"Even so, they are still your potential enemies," Barov insisted.



If he encountered these people on the battlefield, Roland would crush them without hesitation, but to wield the sword and kill a group of civilians simply because of backward thinking and ideological differences was a huge psychological barrier for him. After hesitating for a moment, he ultimately rejected the proposal, "I will have Nightingale go and interrogate these escapees. If there are any spies or scouts hidden among them, capture and hang them; the rest can be expelled from the Western Region."



Barov's eyes flickered as he lowered his head, replying only after a delay, "As you command, Your Highness."



"Is there anything else to report?"



"Not at the moment, Your Highness," he coughed twice, "I will go and deal with the housing allocation now."



"Not in a hurry, these troublesome matters can be dealt with slowly," Roland opened his eyes and stood up, "First, follow me to take a few photos, to relax a bit."

"Pho...tos?" Barov was taken aback.

"You will know soon enough," the prince said with a smile.

In the castle's front courtyard, he called over Carter, Iron Axe, and Soraya as well. In one corner of the garden, several wooden boards, each four to five meters in length and width, were placed, with a canvas covering the ground.

"Border Town is still not very large, but once the lands to the south are developed and connected to Longsong Stronghold, the scale will be dozens of times larger than it is now. If we rely solely on walking, it would take a day or two to travel from east to west, so we must have something that can travel quickly between places. Raising horses is expensive, and it is also impractical to expect every citizen to spend a lot of time learning how to ride," Roland said as he pulled back the canvas, "I plan to promote this mode of transportation in the town. It's simple to use, and much cheaper than a horse."

"What is this...?" Carter was immediately attracted to the novel object before him, "It has two wheels, a metal frame, is it a pushcart?"

"With wheels side by side, it would be difficult to maintain balance even if it were a cart," Barov shook his head, "I can't see how it could replace horses."

Only Iron Axe remained silent, quietly waiting for the prince to explain.

Roland smiled, "This is called a bicycle. I'll demonstrate it for you and you'll understand." He placed his feet on the pedals, adopting a standard starting position, and with a push of one foot, he began riding the bicycle around the cobblestone paths of the garden.



With Anna's precision processing and Soraya's coating technology, manually manufacturing a bicycle was not difficult. Its principles and structure posed no challenge. The parts that required rubber, such as the inner tubes, were simply drawn directly onto a roll of paper tubing—for which Roland had even specially made a simple air pump. The outer tires and brakes used a harder coating of cowhide, the frame was made from hollow iron pipes, the brake cables were made of anti-corrosion copper wire, and the only trouble was the chain, which could only be shaped and linked by Anna, one segment at a time. As for those classic bicycles with pedals mounted directly on the wheels, he didn't care for them at all.



After a lap, Roland pressed the brakes, easily dismounted with a leap, and looked at the row of his stunned subordinates with immense pride in his heart. This was the kind of fine mount a transmigrator should have; compared to horses that required both taming and feeding, bicycles were a lot more enjoyable.



"I plan to open a new bicycle factory in the industrial zone to produce this means of transportation. We'll need to recruit workers and also need to do some advertising to promote it throughout the territory as soon as possible," Roland explained simply. "That's why I've called you here. You need to learn how to ride bicycles first, and then let Miss Soraya paint your images on wood boards while you're cycling. I want all the citizens to see that for just one or two Gold Royals, they can have the same mount as the lord, the commander of the First Army, the chief knight, and the city hall manager."
