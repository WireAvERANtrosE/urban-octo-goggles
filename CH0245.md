## means of transportation
Roland leaned back in his office chair, carefully examining the statistical report prepared by Barov.



It had taken three whole days for the City Hall to sort through the more than six thousand refugees, among which the proportion of craftsmen was relatively low, with only one hundred eighty-six passing the audit. Of course, this was related to the intensity of the audit—since it involved the allocation of housing and the issuance of identity cards.



In Roland's view, only residents with identity cards could be considered his formal subjects in the future. Therefore, it was crucial to strictly control this process while the numbers were still manageable and cultivate core supporters for the town early on. As the population grew, he planned to use the power of the people to assimilate other newcomers—after all, humans are social animals. As long as the general environment was like this, more and more people would identify with his philosophy, and he indeed could provide his subjects with a better life.



"Then the allocation of housing for these craftsmen will be up to you. Whether they are single or have families, each should be given at least one separate suite," Roland instructed.



"Yes," responded Barov, "Your Highness, are these houses to be given as gifts?"



"No, consider it as renting," he shook his head, "The original residents get new community houses for free because most of them have old houses, so it's like exchanging old homes for new ones. However, giving these people houses for free wouldn't encourage them to leave their homes and actively engage in work. Of course, the rent can be set at a lower rate, and tell them that as long as they work hard and save enough gold royals, they can buy the houses outright."



"I understand."



After a moment of silence, Roland suddenly asked, "How many people fled after the knighting ceremony?"



"As of today, not a single original resident, seven from among the serfs," Barov paused, "There are quite a few more from the refugees of the Eastern Region, a total of one hundred fifteen people."



"Is that so." He sighed softly, knowing the moment he decided to bring the witches to the forefront, there would be such a situation. To assess the public's reaction and to prevent accidents, Roland had specially arranged for a squad of musketeers to be stationed a few miles away from the town, intercepting the escapees while also counting their numbers to gauge the level of acceptance towards the witches.



And the answer was not perfect, but at least it was very good—the original residents had fully accepted the witches, which was close to his expectations; the number of serfs who had fled was less than estimated, it seemed that the theater performances close to the grassroots level were effective; however, regarding the refugees from the Eastern Region who had received the witches' treatment and were in a situation with their homes destroyed and no place to go, it was somewhat surprising to Roland that still over a hundred chose to leave.



"Your Highness, I suggest that we execute them all," Barov said calmly, "Those who are determined to leave under these circumstances must be deeply influenced by the Church. It's foreseeable that they will not stand on the side of royal power in the future, and will most likely turn into followers of the Church. There's no need to show them the slightest mercy."



"Not necessarily..." the Prince closed his eyes and said, "Those who are truly devout to the Church should be the more than three hundred refugees who refused to leave the King's City even when faced with the demonic plague. These people might just be unable to change their own views, stubbornly believing that witches are evil and just want to flee from this place."



"Even so, they are still potential enemies to you," Barov insisted.



If it were on the battlefield, Roland would have no hesitation in crushing these people, but to wield the sword of slaughter against a group of civilians just because of backward thinking and ideological differences was a huge psychological barrier for him. After hesitating for a moment, he finally rejected the proposal, "I will have Nightingale go and interrogate these escapees. If there are spies or scouts among them, capture and hang them. The rest can be expelled from the Western Region."



Barov's eyes flickered as he bowed his head and it took a while before he replied, "As you command, Your Highness."



"Is there anything else to report?"



"Not at the moment, Your Highness," he coughed twice, "I will go and handle the housing allocation now."



"No need to rush, these annoying matters can be dealt with slowly," Roland opened his eyes and stood up, "First, follow me to take a few pictures, to relax your mind a bit."

"Pic...tures?" Barov was taken aback.

"You'll know soon enough," the prince said with a smile.

In the castle's front courtyard, he called over Carter, Iron Axe, and Soraya as well. In one corner of the garden, there were several wooden boards, four to five meters in length and width, and a piece of canvas was laid out on the ground.

"Border Town is not very big at the moment, but after the southern lands have been developed and connected to the Longsong Stronghold, the scale will be dozens of times larger than it is now. If we rely solely on walking, it would take a day or two to go from east to west, so we must have something that can travel quickly between places. Raising horses is expensive, and it's not feasible for every subject to spend a lot of time learning how to ride," Roland said as he pulled back the canvas, "I plan to promote this mode of transportation in town, it's simple to use, and the price is much lower than that of a horse."

"What is this...?" Carter was immediately attracted by the novel gadget before him, "Two wheels, and a metal frame, is it a cart?"

"With two wheels side by side, it would be difficult to maintain balance even if it were a cart," Barov shook his head, "I can't see how it could replace a horse."

Only Iron Axe remained silent, quietly waiting for the prince to explain.

Roland smiled, "This thing is called a bicycle, I'll demonstrate how to use it, and you'll understand." He stood with his feet on the pedals, assumed a standard starting position, pushed off with one foot, and began to ride around the garden's stone path.



With Anna's precision processing and Soraya's coating technology, hand-manufacturing a bicycle was not difficult. Its principles and structure presented no challenges, and the parts that required rubber were replaced with coatings—for instance, the inner tube was simply drawn directly onto a roll of paper tubing, for which Roland even specially made a simple pump. The outer tire and brake pads used a harder leather coating, the frame was made of hollow iron tubing, the brake cables were made of rust-resistant copper wires, and the only troublesome part was the chain, which could only be shaped and linked together into a long strand by Anna. As for the classical bicycle that had pedals mounted directly on the wheel, he did not think highly of it at all.



After a lap, Roland pressed the brake, easily dismounted with a leap, and looked at the row of his stunned subordinates, feeling immensely proud. This was the kind of exquisite mount a transmigrator should have—far more exhilarating than horses that required both taming and feeding.



"I plan to open a new bicycle factory in the industrial area to produce this means of transportation. We will need not only to recruit workers but also to do proper promotion, aiming to spread it throughout the territory as soon as possible," Roland explained briefly, "That is why I have called you here. You all need to learn how to ride a bicycle first, and then have Miss Soraya paint your likeness riding on a wooden board. I want all the citizens to see that, for the cost of one to two Gold royals, they can have the same mount as the Lord, the First Army Commander, the Chief Knight, and the Manager of the City Hall."
