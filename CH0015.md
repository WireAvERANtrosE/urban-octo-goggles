## Believing oneself to be
Seeing the knight take his leave, Roland returned to the table. "You can heal small animals, so why do you still think witches are evil?"



"My teacher said that witches can do things that ordinary people can't, and sometimes it doesn't seem bad, but that is a trap set by the devil to lure more people..." The girl's voice lowered, "I, I really have never seen the devil, I swear."



"Of course, you haven't seen it; that's just a lie of the Church, and your teacher is one of those who have been deceived," Roland consoled.



"The Church lies?" Nana's mouth hung open in surprise. "Why?"



Roland shook his head, not explaining. Even if he told them, they would not understand. When a civilization has not developed to a certain extent, such peculiar things always happen. People automatically attribute natural disasters, human calamities, or phenomena they cannot understand to an imagined mastermind behind the scenes—and historically, this blame has mostly fallen on women.



In this world, after witches acquired tangible powers of unknown origin, they became easier targets for the Church. Just think about it, the Church would never ignore such anomalies. They either had to sanctify all witches, claiming it to be God's blessing, or hunt the witches, labeling them as the devil's spokespersons. However, if they chose the former, the authority of their monotheistic religion would be greatly undermined—because the appearance of witches had nothing to do with the Church. What if other churches that worship different gods also made witches into saints? If everyone is chosen by God, then which god is the one true God?



The premise of polytheism coexisting is that the gods truly exist and can restrain each other. Since gods do not exist and are all made up by human fabrication, why should they share this world? Therefore, every monotheistic religion will claim that the god they believe in is the true God. For heretics, there is only one path: physical annihilation. Similarly, they can only choose the latter, to relentlessly strike down witches.



It's not about preference; it's simply for the sake of interest.



Live chickens were kept in the castle's kitchen, and when the knight came carrying one by its wings, it was still flapping and kicking wildly.



The following event left Nana dumbstruck. Roland took out a small silver knife from his waist and instructed the knight to hold the chicken firmly before he stabbed it. After the deed, he asked Nana to heal it, and then repeated the process in different ways. After the chicken that had been tormented for half the day finally died, Roland had a rough understanding of Nana's abilities.



She could restore damaged parts, including cuts, fractures, and bruises. If a part was completely missing, for example, if a chicken's claw was cut off, she could not make a new claw grow. However, if the severed claw was reattached before using her ability, the break would heal as if it had never been damaged. Lastly, she couldn't reverse life and death; once the chicken died, her healing became ineffective.



Throughout the healing process, Roland did not see the "sticky water" she described. She simply placed her hand over the chicken's wound, and the wound would heal at a visible speed. After a series of tests, Nana's physical exertion was not significant, at least not as much as Anna's when she was training, not breaking a sweat.



The only one who was dissatisfied was Nana herself; she felt that the treatment of the chicken was too harsh, and she pouted and glared at Roland until the experiment was over.



"Alright, stop glaring, come have something to eat," Roland suggested, deciding to use the "summon afternoon tea" tactic to divert her attention. This move had never failed with Anna, and he believed that girls of their age group could hardly resist the temptation of delicious desserts. And indeed, Nana's reaction to the exquisite pastries was not much different from Anna's.



After finishing the pastries, Roland had someone escort Nana away. Anna asked in confusion, "Why didn't you keep her here? She's a witch just like me, isn't she?"



"She still has family, and her family has not yet discovered she's a witch."



Anna said softly, "It's only a matter of time."



"Yes, it's just a matter of time," Roland sighed, "so the later it can be, the better. Do you... miss your father?"

She shook her head, her eyes as calm as a lake's surface, without a ripple. It seemed that being betrayed by her own father had left her utterly disillusioned. But without relatives, she still had friends.

"Nana will come by often. In fact, I plan to have her come here every two days to practice her abilities."

Hearing this, she blinked rapidly and nodded.

"Do you want to, like her, return to Teacher Karl's academy to study with the other children?"

Anna did not answer, but he felt he heard her heart's voice.

"This situation won't last too long... As long as I am here, you will eventually be able to live like normal people, and no one will capture you and send you to the gallows wherever you go. That day will come," Roland said, emphasizing every word, "I promise."

...

Since Karl Barton took over the project, Prince Roland suddenly had a lot of free time.



Every afternoon, he stayed in the castle garden, accompanying Anna or Nana in their practice. Nowadays, Anna no longer needed to prepare extra clothing when training; even with flames dancing on each of her fingertips, she could skillfully control them without accidentally setting her witch's hat on fire like before.



Nana had also changed into a set of witch's uniforms and, although she was reluctant to practice, she dutifully did so for the sake of the afternoon tea. Watching the two witches bustling about in the yard, Roland felt a great sense of amusement.



Occasionally, he would also go to the foot of Northern Slope Mountain to check on the progress of the construction. After more than two weeks of building, the wall had grown to about a hundred meters. In an era without theodolites for measuring distances, Karl directed the craftsmen to use a wooden pole to determine the distance and straightness based on the shadow cast by the sun at the same time every day. Watchtowers were placed every ten poles to stabilize the wall.



Such large-scale use of labor naturally caught the attention of the nobles in town, but aside from asking Barov for information, they did nothing else, acting as if it had nothing to do with them. Roland didn't mind at all; these people's properties were all in Longsong Stronghold, and they certainly would not stay to help him guard Border Town. He could even imagine them gathering in private, scoffing at his overreaching efforts.



Not just the nobles, but the merchants felt the same. The traveling merchants who used to buy animal pelts in Border Town, seeing that there was nothing to purchase this time, had begun to set out back to the stronghold. Their dissatisfaction at returning empty-handed, naturally, was directed at the ruler Roland. The notion that Greycastle's fourth prince, Roland Wimbledon, was foolishly and ignorantly undertaking construction right before the Evil Months had already spread along the Redwater River.



At this point, probably no one believed he could hold onto the town, and most people didn't even consider this possibility. After all, the impression that the fourth prince had left on everyone did not include being brave in battle. No matter what he was up to, in the end, he would have to obediently return to the stronghold for refuge.



And so, amid the buzz of discussions, Roland welcomed his first winter since crossing over.
