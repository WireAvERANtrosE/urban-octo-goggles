Watching the knight take his leave, Roland returned to the table. "You can heal small animals, so why do you still believe witches are evil?"

"The teacher said witches can do things ordinary people can't, and sometimes it doesn't seem bad, but that's a trap the devil sets to lure more people..." the girl's voice trailed off, "I, I really haven't seen the devil, I swear."

"Of course you haven't; that's just a lie of the church. Your teacher is also one of the deceived," Roland soothed.

"The church lies?" Nana's mouth fell open in shock. "Why?"

Roland shook his head, offering no explanation. Even if he did, they wouldn't understand. When civilization has not developed to a certain point, these bizarre occurrences always happen. Even without the drive of self-interest, people would attribute natural disasters, human calamities, or phenomena they couldn't understand to some imagined force behind the scenes—historically, this blame has often fallen on women.

In this world, after witches gained real power from unknown origins, they became even easier targets for the church. Just think about it, the church would never leave such anomalies unchecked. They would either declare all witches as saints, claiming it as a gift from God, or they would hunt witches, branding them as spokespersons for the devil. However, if they chose the former, the authority of monotheism would be greatly undermined—because the existence of witches has nothing to do with the church. What if other churches that worship different gods also declared witches as saints? If everyone is chosen by a god, then which god is the only true god?

The premise for the coexistence of polytheism is that the gods truly exist and can restrain each other. Since gods do not exist and are merely figments created by rhetoric, why should they share this world? Therefore, any monotheistic religion claims their god is the true god; for heretics, there is only one path: physical annihilation. Likewise, they could only choose the latter, striking witches relentlessly.

It's not about preference; it's purely for self-interest.

The castle kitchen was stocked with live chickens, and when the knight came in holding one by the wings, it was still flapping wildly.

What happened next left Nana dumbfounded. Roland pulled out a small silver knife from his waist and had the knight hold the chicken firmly as he stabbed it. After the stabbing, he had Nana heal it, then continued in different ways... repeating the process.

By the time the chicken that had been tormented for half a day finally died, Roland had gained a rough understanding of Nana's abilities.

She could repair damaged parts, including cuts, fractures, and bruises. If a part was completely missing, like cutting off a chicken's claw, she could not make it grow a new one. However, if the severed claw was reattached before she used her power, she could heal the cut completely. Lastly, she could not reverse life and death; once the chicken died, her healing was ineffective.

Throughout the healing process, Roland did not see the "sticky water" she described. She simply placed her hand on the chicken's wound and it would heal at a visible rate. After a series of experiments, Nana's physical exertion was not significant, at least not as much as Anna's when she trained to the point of sweating profusely.

The only dissatisfied person was Nana herself. She felt that treating the chicken this way was too much, so much so that she pouted and glared at Roland until the end of the experiment.

"Alright, stop glaring. Come and have something to eat," Roland said, resorting to the "summoning afternoon tea" tactic to divert her attention. This strategy had never failed with Anna, and he believed that few girls of that age could resist the temptation of delicious desserts. As it turned out, Nana was no less affected by the exquisite pastries than her predecessor.

After finishing the pastries, Roland had someone escort Nana away. Anna, puzzled, asked, "Why didn't you keep her here? She's a witch like me, isn't she?"

"She still has family, and her family hasn't yet discovered that she's a witch," Anna said softly, "but it's only a matter of time."

"Yes, just a matter of time," Roland sighed, "so delaying it even a little is worth it. Do you... miss your father?"

She shook her head, her eyes as calm as the surface of a lake, without a ripple of disturbance. It seemed that the betrayal by her own father had led her to complete disillusionment. But without relatives, she would still have friends.

"Nana will come by often. In fact, I plan to have her practice her abilities here every two days."

Hearing this, she blinked rapidly and nodded vigorously.

"Do you want to go back to Teacher Karl's academy and study with the other children like her?"

Anna did not answer, but he felt he could hear her heart's response.

"This situation won't last too long... as long as I am here, you will eventually be able to live like ordinary people, without anyone arresting you and sending you to the gallows. That day will come," Roland said, emphasizing every word, "I promise."

...

Ever since Karl Barton took over the project, Prince Roland suddenly found himself with more free time.

He spent every afternoon in the castle garden, accompanying Anna or Nana in their practice. Now Anna no longer needed to prepare additional clothing for her training. Even with flames dancing on every fingertip, she could manipulate them skillfully without accidentally setting her witch's hat on fire like before.

Nana had also changed into the same style of witch's uniform. She was reluctant to practice, but for the sake of the afternoon tea, she pouted and obediently did so. Watching the two witches moving around in the yard gave Roland a great sense of wicked satisfaction.

Occasionally, he would also go to the foot of the North Slope Mountain to check on the progress of the construction. After more than two weeks of building, the wall had been extended by about a hundred meters. In an era without theodolites for measuring distances, Karl directed the craftsmen to use a wooden pole to determine the distance and straightness based on the shadow cast by the sun at the same time each day. Every ten poles, a watchtower was set up to stabilize the wall.

Such a large-scale employment naturally attracted the attention of the nobles in the town, but other than asking Barov for information, they made no further moves, as if the matter had nothing to do with them. Roland did not mind at all; the properties of these nobles were all in Longsong Stronghold, and they would certainly not stay to help him defend Border Town. He could even imagine these people gathering privately and scoffing at his overestimation of his own abilities.

Not only the nobles, but the merchants as well. The traders who used to come to Border Town to buy animal furs, seeing that there was nothing to buy this time, had begun to set off back to the stronghold. Their dissatisfaction with returning empty-handed was naturally vented on the ruler Roland. The notion that Prince Roland of Greycastle was foolishly and ignorantly undertaking construction before the arrival of the demonic month had already spread along the Redwater River.

At this moment, probably no one believed he could hold onto this small town, and most people didn't even consider this possibility. After all, the impression the Fourth Prince had left on everyone did not include a willingness to fight. No matter what he was up to, in the end, he would always obediently return to the fortress for refuge.

Thus, amidst the buzz of discussions, Roland welcomed his first winter since crossing over.
