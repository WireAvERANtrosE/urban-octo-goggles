## Alchemy and Chemistry
The principles and structure of a direct current generator are very simple. Roland had dismantled over a dozen four-wheel drive car motors as a child, ranging from the ordinary whiteboard motors to the legendary Golden Super Tyrant, and had even hand-wound the copper wire on the rotors himself. These motors are typical direct current machines.



There is no structural difference between a direct current generator and a direct current motor; essentially, they are the same device and their functions are interchangeable. As long as another machine drives the rotation of the motor's rotor, causing the wire to continuously cut through the magnetic flux, it will generate a steady induction current.



With the help of Miya and Anna, Roland was able to assemble a simple direct current motor in just half a day. The stator part was made entirely of wood, which was then magnetized by Miya. The commutator at the end of the rotor was embedded in a piece of round wood, with a hole in the center to connect to the steam engine's drive shaft. This design was not only convenient to manufacture but also ensured insulation between the commutators.



As for the new model steam engine, it became a spectacle for him and Miya to watch Anna demonstrate her superb machining skills. When large parts needed to be made, she would cause Blackfire to spread out, wrapping a pile of iron ingots like cloth, melting them before retracting the Blackfire to compress into plates that met the size requirements, and finally cutting them into shape.



The next day, as Roland was preparing to head to the backyard of the calcination room to test the generator, the guards brought him some very pleasing news: the Chief Alchemist of the Redwater City Alchemy Workshop had arrived in Border Town, and he was not alone.



...

Kyle Sichi made a decisive move, and that very afternoon, he took his family and over a dozen disciples aboard a merchant ship bound for Border Town. Regrettably, Chemist had hesitated and ultimately declined his invitation.



He did not reveal the contents of this letter to the other alchemists; the more people who knew, the later they would depart. Kyle was worried that news of the successful production of crystal glass would soon reach the ears of the Duke, and by then, it would not be so easy to leave—as for such high-profit luxury goods, the Duke would certainly want to keep a tight hold on them.



He had already written down the glass formula and the burning method on parchment and placed it in the formula cabinet of the refining room, which could be considered a payback for the Duke's substantial investment in the construction of the alchemy workshop. However, in the face of the truth of alchemy, neither crystal glass nor the alchemy workshop was worth mentioning.



Five days later, Kyle finally met the person who had written the letter—Lord of Border Town, Roland Wimbledon.



In the castle's reception room, just as he had finished his bows and was about to sit down, he couldn't wait to speak, "Your Highness, I wish to have a thorough discussion with your alchemist."



"My alchemist?" The other party smiled, "Before you arrived, Border Town didn't have an alchemist. But now, you are my alchemist."



"You mean to say... all those alchemical formulas were written by you?" Kyle ignored the second half of his sentence, his face turning somewhat pale. A sudden thought occurred to him, the other was a prince, whose knowledge all came from the teachings of court tutors. If he knew all this, wouldn't it mean that the King's City Alchemist Association had long understood the essence of alchemical transformation? And here he was, foolishly thinking he could surpass them, the idea was simply laughable.



"Not entirely," Roland said, "These formulas are from ancient texts over four hundred years old, which I discovered by chance. It seems that hundreds of years ago, they called alchemy 'chemistry.'"



"Chem...istry?" Kyle felt much better hearing that the formulas didn't come from the King's City Alchemist Association, but the answer given by the prince still shocked him. Alchemical books from over four hundred years ago? The King's City Alchemist Association itself had less than two hundred years of history, could it be that the later generations were not as advanced as their predecessors?



"That's right, in those books, the scholars proposed a hypothesis, which is the conservation of mass. The substances that make up everything in the world do not disappear or increase; they simply change from one form to another. For example, this pastry," Roland pointed to the cake on the long table, "after you eat it, part of it is absorbed by you, and part of it is expelled from your body. If you add together the absorbed part and the expelled part, their mass should be equal."



"Wait a moment... Your Highness," Kyle pondered, "If I burn a piece of wood to ash, no matter how I weigh it, the ash is always lighter than the wood. If matter is conserved, then where does the missing part of the wood go?"



"This is also explained in the books," Roland said with a smile, "It turns into gas and water. And the water is evaporated by the fire, so in the end, you only see the residue that is left behind."



"Gases?" Kyle felt something stirring in his heart, "Does air also have weight?"

"Of course, all matter has mass," the prince nodded, "It's quite simple to verify this. Fill a bottle with a bunch of sawdust, cover the opening and place it on a scale until it's balanced, then ignite the sawdust. In the end, you will find that the weight of the bottle does not change. Because the gases released by burning cannot escape, they are still in the bottle."

"Is this... also written in the ancient texts?" Kyle asked eagerly, "May I see that book?"

"If you can agree to a few conditions," Roland spread his hands.

"Please speak."

"Firstly, you must work for me, and your salary will be calculated according to what you earned at the alchemy workshop in Redwater City. Second, once you take this job, you must abide by the confidentiality rules, which means you cannot disclose the content of your work to other alchemists. Third, if you agree, we will sign a contract. This contract will last for five years, after which you can choose to stay or leave, and the alchemical results will no longer be restricted by confidentiality rules, and you may show them to other alchemists or alchemy guilds. In return, if you accept these three conditions, Border Town will provide you with housing and a chemical laboratory. I will also lend you the book 'Elementary Chemistry' to read, and if there are things you do not understand, you can come to me."

It didn't sound like a harsh condition to Kyle. Although terms like confidentiality rules and chemical laboratories were somewhat mouthful, he could still grasp the general meaning. A five-year contract was not too long; he had thought the lord would demand that he stays in Border Town forever.

Moreover... even if the conditions were more demanding, he wanted to witness that book which recorded the essence of alchemy for himself.

With these thoughts in mind, Kyle stood up and bowed slightly: "I am willing to serve you, Your Highness."



"Very well, then it's settled," the prince seemed not to care much about formalities, "Your workplace will be by the Redwater River. After signing the contract, I will take you to familiarize yourself with the laboratory, and by the way, introduce the uses and operating procedures of those glass vessels."



What made the Chief Alchemist feel somewhat uneasy was why His Highness the Prince spoke of alchemy so proficiently, even giving the impression of being fully confident? Wasn't he just an ordinary noble who had happened upon some ancient alchemical texts? But these were all minor details, he suppressed his doubts and asked, "May I know what Your Highness wishes for me to concoct?"



"High-concentration acid, the more the better," the prince replied.
