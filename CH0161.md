## Alchemy and Chemistry
The principle and structure of a direct current generator are very simple. When Roland was a child, he had dismantled over ten motors from four-wheel drive toy cars, ranging from ordinary whiteboard motors to the legendary Golden Super Tyrant, and he had even hand-wound the copper wire on the rotors himself. These motors were all typical direct current motors.



There is no difference in structure between a direct current generator and a direct current motor; essentially, they are the same device and their functions can be interchanged. As long as another machine drives the motor's rotor to rotate, continuously cutting through the magnetic flux lines, it can generate a steady flow of induced current.



With the help of Miya and Anna, Roland was able to assemble a simple direct current motor in just half a day. The stator was entirely made of wood, which Miya then magnetized. The commutator segments at the end of the rotor were embedded in a section of round wood, with a hole in the center to connect to the steam engine's shaft. This design was not only easy to manufacture but also ensured insulation between the commutator segments.



As for the new steam engine, it became a show of Anna's amazing machining skills that he and Miya watched from the sidelines. When large parts needed to be made, she would wrap a pile of iron ingots with her Blackfire as if it were cloth, melt them, and then contract the Blackfire to press the metal into sheets that met the size requirements before cutting them into shape.



The next day, as Roland was preparing to go to the backyard of the calcination workshop to test the generator, a guard brought him some delightful news. The chief alchemist from the Redwater City Alchemy Workshop had arrived in Border Town, and he was not alone.



...

Kyle Sichi made his decision with determination, and that very afternoon, he took his family and more than a dozen disciples on a merchant ship bound for Border Town. Regrettably, Chemist hesitated and ultimately refused his invitation.



He did not reveal the contents of the letter to the other alchemists; the more people knew, the later they would depart. Kyle was worried that news of the successful production of crystal glass would soon reach the Duke's ears. By then, it would not be so easy to leave—as for such a high-profit luxury item, the Duke would surely want to keep it firmly in his own hands.



He had already written down the glass formula and the method of firing it on parchment and stored it in the formula cabinet in the refining room as a form of repayment to the Duke for investing a hefty sum of money in building the alchemy workshop. However, in the face of the truth of alchemy, neither the crystal glass nor the alchemy workshop was worth mentioning.



Five days later, Kaim finally met the author of the letter—the Lord of Border Town, Roland Wimbledon.

In the castle's reception room, just as he finished his greeting and had barely taken his seat, he couldn't wait to speak, "Your Highness, I would like to have a serious talk with your alchemist."

"My alchemist?" The other party smiled, "Before you came, Border Town didn't have an alchemist. But now, you are my alchemist."

"You mean... those alchemical formulas were all written by you?" Kaim ignored the latter part of his sentence, his face turning somewhat pale. A new possibility occurred to him—the other party was a prince, educated by the court tutors. If he knew all this, didn't that mean the Alchemy Association of the capital had long understood the essence of alchemical transformation? And here he was, foolishly thinking he could surpass them, how ridiculous that seemed.

"Not entirely," Roland said, "These formulas come from ancient texts more than four hundred years old, which I discovered by chance. It seems that hundreds of years ago, they called alchemy 'chemistry'."

"Che...mistry?" Kaim felt relieved upon hearing that the formulas did not come from the capital's Alchemy Association, but the prince's answer still surprised him. Alchemical books from more than four hundred years ago? The Alchemy Association of the capital was not even two hundred years old. Could it be that the predecessors were more knowledgeable than the people of today?

"Correct. In the book, those scholars mentioned a hypothesis—the conservation of mass. The material that makes up everything in the world does not vanish or increase; they simply change from one form to another. For example, this pastry," Roland pointed to a cake on the long table, "after you eat it, part of it is absorbed by you, and part of it is excreted. If you add up the absorbed part and the excreted part, their mass should be equal."

"Wait... Your Highness," Kaim pondered, "If I burn a piece of wood to ashes, no matter how I weigh it, the ashes are lighter than the wood. If matter is conserved, where did the missing part go?"

"This is also explained in the book," Roland smiled, "It turns into gas and water. And the water is evaporated by the fire, so in the end, all you see is the remaining residue."



"Gas?" Camilla felt something stirring inside, "Does air also have weight?"

"Of course, all matter has mass," the prince nodded. "It's quite simple to verify this. Fill a bottle with wood shavings, cover the opening, and place it on a scale to balance it. After setting the wood shavings alight, you'll find that the weight of the bottle does not change. Because the gases released from the combustion cannot escape, they remain inside the bottle."

"Is... is this also written in the ancient texts?" Camilla asked eagerly, "May I see that book?"

"If you can agree to a few conditions," Roland spread his hands.

"Please go on."

"Firstly, you will work for me, and your salary will be calculated based on what you earned at the Redwater City Alchemy Workshop. Second, once you accept this job, you must abide by confidentiality regulations. That is, you are not to divulge any work content to other alchemists. Third, if you agree, we will sign a contract. This contract will last for five years, after which you are free to choose whether to stay or go, and the alchemical results will no longer be restricted by the confidentiality regulations, and you can show them to other alchemists or alchemy guilds. Correspondingly, if you accept these three conditions, Border Town will provide housing and a chemical laboratory. I will also lend you the book 'Elementary Chemistry' to read, and if there are things you do not understand, you can come and ask me."

The conditions did not seem too harsh to Camilla. Although terms like confidentiality regulations and chemical laboratories sounded a bit complicated, he could still grasp the general idea. A five-year contract was not too long; he had thought the lord would demand that he stay in Border Town forever.

And besides... even if the conditions were more severe, he wanted to see for himself that book which documented the essence of alchemy.

With this in mind, Camilla stood up and bowed slightly: "I am willing to serve you, Your Highness."



"Very well, then it's settled," the prince seemed not to care much for formalities, "Your workplace will be by the Redwater River. After signing the contract, I will take you to familiarize yourself with the laboratory and introduce you to the use and operation procedures of those glass vessels."



What made the Chief Alchemist feel somewhat uneasy was why the prince spoke of alchemy with such proficiency, even giving the impression of being fully confident? Wasn't he just an ordinary nobleman who had chanced upon some ancient alchemical texts? But these were all trivial details. He suppressed his doubts and asked, "May I know what you require me to concoct, Your Highness?"



"A high concentration of acid, as much as possible," the prince replied.
