## Ancient Books and Ruins (Part 1)
Just as Wendy had said, the next morning after the witches had been called by the maids to have breakfast on the first floor, the prince handed each of them a beautifully made piece of sheepskin paper. Considering that some witches couldn't read, Scroll repeated the contents for everyone. Then came the signing and the pressing of fingerprints.



Roland knew that it would be difficult for them to truly understand the meaning of every line on the contract, but that was okay; they would understand in time. He also knew that even if it were a contract of indenture, they would sign their names at this moment. Roland didn't feel that providing a relatively generous contract was a losing deal for himself, since he had chosen this path, he had to look further ahead. What he was doing now was to establish a good cycle, a win-win structure that could be implemented for a long time.



After securing the contracts, Roland proceeded with the training tasks for each person according to the plan he had made the previous night, then called Leaves, Scroll, and Soraya to follow him back to his office.



After closing the door, Nightingale revealed her figure and winked at her sisters.



"I've been thinking about what Wendy told me yesterday," Roland pulled back the curtains to let the bright sunshine into the room, "She said you encountered terrifying monsters, and in the end, only seven people survived. Even the Mentor of the Witch Cooperation Association, Cara, died in the Barbarian Land. I want to know, what exactly did you encounter? Were they mixed demonic beasts?"



Leaves was the first to speak: "They weren't demonic beasts, they were devils from the Gates of Hell, with tall statures, capable of commanding demonic beasts and possessing magical power, just like..." She hesitated, "Just like us."



"Devils?" Roland frowned and looked towards Soraya, "Were you there at the time?"



She nodded.



"Can you draw the scene from that time?" Roland handed her a piece of paper.



Soraya closed her eyes, appearing somewhat pained, but she still took the paper and walked over to the table.

As her ability was deployed, the quill pen that always seemed to flicker in and out of existence appeared in her hand, its tip swirling with rainbow light. Then, it flew out of her hand, rapidly moving across the paper. A lifelike image gradually emerged on the paper, while Soraya never once opened her eyes.

Roland approached the table and saw that the pattern on the paper was incredibly realistic—no, he told himself, this was not a drawing, but a real-time capture of the scene that had occurred in the Barbarian Land. Her ability was like a camera, reproducing the massacre from a first-person perspective.

When the drawing was complete, Soraya's forehead was covered with sweat beads, clearly, the memory was like a nightmare to her.

Nightingale also leaned in at this time, "Is this the devil?"

"That's them," Leaf pointed to the one closest to the viewpoint, "This devil wearing metal gloves, he can summon lightning to attack and is immensely strong, more than half a dozen sisters died at his hands. The devil in the distance can throw spears several times faster than a crossbow bolt. However, their special attacks can't be used in quick succession, and that's when I took the opportunity to kill them."

"By yourself?" Roland asked.

"The tube under the evil beast's helmet is the devil's weakness," Leaf pointed to the neck of the Ironhand Devil, "Cara's Magic Snake bit off his tube, and ultimately she perished together with him. I used the same method, relying on a hand crossbow to kill another one. It seems that some kind of red gas was stored in the tubes, and only after the gas leaked out, would they die."

Well, no matter how you looked at it, this thing seemed like an oxygen tank, how could such a creature exist in the wasteland? Roland was puzzled. But if they were to say they were aliens, that clearly wasn't the case either. Look at that tube full of patches, and the clothes made of beast hide, their level of civilization could only be said to be on par with his own.



Whether through technology or magic, the ability to actively travel to other planets in itself demonstrates their strength—humans on Earth are still staggering when it comes to landing on the moon. Of course, one cannot rule out some civilizations with oddly allocated talents. Roland thought, in any case, the "Devils" were not an invincible enemy; they too could be killed.



"Besides the Devils, we also saw a city floating in the sky," Leaf added, "No matter how far we walked towards it, it remained ahead of us. Lightning mentioned it in her adventure stories; it seems to be a mirage."



"Can you draw it?" Roland asked Scroll.



She nodded, summoned the magic pen once again, and sketched the floating city as described by Leaf onto paper.



Roland examined the image carefully. There wasn't much information in the blurred image, but if the city was indeed a mirage, then at least it suggested that its real location was somewhere in the Barbarian Land. The blood mist that filled the sky above the city was the gas that the Devils breathed. This explanation was much more reliable than the alien theory, after all, the vast continent west of the Impassable Mountain Range was an unexplored mysterious area, and the existence of other races there would not be surprising.



Now only one last question remained, "I heard from Nightingale and Wendy that Cara decided to search for the Holy Mountain because of an ancient book," Roland asked, "Scroll, have you seen that book?"



Scroll hesitated for a moment, "Cara does not allow anyone to see that book, but... I have sneaked a peek at it. The text recorded inside is chaotic and... unbelievable."



"Can you make a copy of it? Let me have a look."



"All of that is not true, Your Highness, the non-existence of the Holy Mountain has proven this point," she sighed and raised her right hand, "I hope you won't be misled by the content of the books."



A book with gold-trimmed edges appeared in mid-air, its covers opening outward as the pages rapidly flipped before closing with a thud, landing in her hand. "Your Highness, I hope you are the only one to see this. I do not wish to see any other sisters turn out like Cara."



Roland took the book, "I understand."



After the witches left the office, Nightingale quietly reappeared beside the sofa. As usual, she lifted her robe, propped her feet on the low table, and started chewing on the dried fish.



"Don't you want to take a look?" Roland asked with a smile.



Nightingale snorted, "I'm not interested in things that lunatics love to read."



He shook his head, sat back at the desk, and carefully flipped through the book as if it truly possessed magic.



Just as the scroll had stated, most of the content was obscure and difficult to understand, and it seemed that the style of writing and grammar were not the common form used today. The text mentioned a bleeding red moon, huge stone gates, but the words "Holy Mountain" were conspicuously absent. In fact, apart from the occasional few words whose meanings were clear, the rest of the content was unreadable—the summary being: I recognize every word, but when put together, they make no sense at all. It was unclear whether this was because the content was missing due to the scroll's hurried peeking, or if the book itself was recorded in this manner.



Roland skipped the lengthy paragraphs and went straight to the back. A rather thick book, it had content only on the first few pages, and the rest was blank. Starting from the last page, the handwriting suddenly changed, from neat writing to a sloppy scrawl, as if jotted down in haste, but the content became clear and understandable.



The very first line of the handwriting was "We have failed. Mortals cannot defeat the devils."
