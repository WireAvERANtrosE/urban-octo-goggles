## New Castle Facilities
"What is this?" Andrea asked while chewing on dried fish.

"His Highness, the Prince of Greycastle, is toying with something new again," she observed. He was connecting pieces of copper pipes together, then let Anna melt and join the ends, after which Soraya would wrap them with a layer of soft magical creations. At first glance, they looked like the plumbing installed in bathrooms, only much larger in size—each pipe was almost as thick as her own thigh. Without the weight reduction from the Hummingbird, one person would not be able to lift them.



Moreover, these copper pipes were not just in one or two rooms but extended horizontally across the entire castle and the Witch Building, entering from one corner of a room, running along the base of the wall to a strange metal shutter, and then passing to the next room. Only at the end would they connect to the vertical pipes.



This grand project attracted many witches to watch, both from Sleeping Island and the Witch Union, all showing great curiosity.



"Why don't you all take a guess?" he said with a mysterious smile. "If you guess right, I'll add an extra serving of ice cream bread to your dinner."



Andrea's interest was piqued instantly—ice cream bread! That was the most magical delicacy in this place, two slices of bread toasted to perfection with a layer of sweet ice cream filling in between. Such a thing had never even been heard of in the Kingdom of Dawn. She fell in love with it the moment she first tasted it, and despite being teased repeatedly by Ashes, she would eat it with a flushed face. Just looking at it on the plate felt like torture if she didn't eat it.



"Is this for running water into the rooms?" Ashes frowned.



Such a short-sighted comment, Andrea thought to herself, pursing her lips. Copper was not a cheap metal, and if the small pipes in the bathroom could carry water, why make them so big?



However, considering that lately every time she opened her mouth to object, she would be countered with "Who said that food tastes best in its original flavor?"—and that statement had been made in front of Lady Tilly, making it inconvenient to deny—she decided to ignore the superficial remark.



"Myopic vision; who would need such large pipes for water?" someone said from behind. "His Highness would never engage in such thankless, strenuous tasks."

Spot on! It was exactly what Andrea had been thinking. Her spirits lifted as she realized that the only other person who would dare to speak to an extraordinary witch like that, aside from herself, was Miss Nightingale from the Witch Union. Turning around, Andrea indeed saw the other woman looking disdainfully at Ashes, with her chin tilted at just the right angle.

That's the expression a noble should have!

Andrea inwardly praised her. Since arriving in Border Town, the witch she had felt the closest to was this elusive woman. Nightingale had shown impressive skills during the rescue of the relic witches and shared the same noble lineage as herself, even their hair colors were strikingly similar! During the several sniper battles against the mixed demonic beasts on the city walls, the other had recognized her capabilities, and even shared dried fish with her, showing a certain noble flair.

Most importantly, she also had a strong dislike for Ashes.

Even though Andrea didn't know what Ashes did to offend her the first time she came to Border Town, but... the enemy of my enemy is my friend, isn't it? Besides, her personality was so in sync with her own.

"You speak as if you know the answer," Ashes shrugged.

"Of course, I know," Nightingale quirked her lips, "I was in the office the whole time His Highness was drafting the design. I saw every blueprint he drew."

"That's not fair!" Miya muttered.



"She's not taking part in the guessing game," the prince's words made Nightingale's smug expression stiffen, "Here's a hint for you all, these pipes are just a part of the system. You might want to look around other places, it could make guessing the answer easier."

"Cooh!" Maggie immediately flew out of the room with Lightning, and the other witches were not far behind, each following the direction of the pipes to different locations. Andrea deliberately stayed behind everyone else, and after they left, she gestured to Nightingale to step outside the door.

"What exactly is this?" Andrea asked in a low voice, "If I guess it right, I'll share half of my bread with you for dinner."

"I don't know either," Nightingale's response slightly surprised her.

"Didn't you say you've seen all the blueprints?"

"Yes, just like 'The Basics of Natural Science Theory,' you recognize all the words, don't you? But can you understand what they mean when they are put together?"

"Uh—" Andrea opened her mouth, but found that Nightingale was making complete sense. She herself had flipped through that book, and indeed, it might as well have been written in an alien script.

"If just looking at the blueprints could reveal His Highness's intentions, probably only Anna in the Witch Union would have such ability," Nightingale hinted, "If you ask her, she will definitely be able to tell you the answer."

After she left, Andrea hesitated for a long time, but in the end, she still didn't call Anna out of the room. It wasn't out of pride or embarrassment, but rather... reverence. She had never feared vicious criminals or the ruthless Judgment Army, but she felt a genuine sense of awe towards this girl who was not even twenty years old.



She remembered once passing by the prince's office by chance and overhearing Anna conversing with His Highness. The content of their discussion, even thinking about it now, gave her goosebumps. Something about high angle calculations, incorporating impact point parameters to correct trajectories, and the conversion of kinetic energy in an ideal state, made her stand rooted to the spot in shock. Why could another witch, speaking such incomprehensible words, express herself so fluently? From that moment on, Andrea developed a kind of reverence towards Anna, feeling that she was not of the same kind as herself, but rather on the same level as Lady Tilly.



Since she couldn't get the answer, she had to rely on herself. Following the prince's hints, Andrea went from room to room — she found that in the completed rooms, the copper pipes were isolated with a right-angled iron fence, as if afraid of someone touching them. If it weren't for savages like Ashes, touching the copper pipes wouldn't matter, right? Remembering what Nightingale had said, "His Highness never does something that's both tiresome and thankless," it seemed that these iron fences clearly had their own purpose.



When she arrived at the first floor of the Witch Building, she made another discovery; there was a new bungalow between the castle and the Witch Building, and the copper pipes leading to both buildings extended from there.



Inside the house was a huge iron box, the lower half hollow, with a large chimney on top... It looked quite like a stove used for cooking. Moreover, she saw a pipe directly connected to the well in the courtyard, resembling a water tower's supply device.



Wait a minute... Could this be used to heat water?



But if the pipes were for transporting hot water, there was no need for them to be so large, right?



Andrea was puzzled and could not figure it out in the end.



Before dinner, His Highness gathered all the witches in the hall and said with a smile, "Starting today, the castle's heating system is officially in operation."



"Heating?" Ashes asked, puzzled.



"Yes, after the water is boiled in the boiler, the high-temperature steam flows through the pipes into the room, raising the temperature through the radiator. As long as the doors and windows are closed, the entire room will quickly warm up," the prince explained. "Compared to fire barrels that are not only inconvenient to move but also require opening windows for ventilation to prevent carbon monoxide poisoning, the new heating equipment doesn't have these concerns. You can even enjoy the warmth of spring when sleeping. After the debugging is over, the residential areas will gradually adopt this heating equipment."



"So, the winners of tonight's ice cream bread, besides Anna, who participated in the installation of the heating system, Soraya, and Hummingbird, there is only one correct guesser, and that is—Tilly!"



During dinner, Andrea gazed longingly at Lady Tilly enjoying the delicious treat, completely forgetting her noble composure.
