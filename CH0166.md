## Eve of the Decisive Battle
On the fifth day as agreed, Roland finally prepared all the ingredients needed to make nitrocellulose.



During the electrolysis of the salt water, he made a serious oversight by using the copper strips leftover from Anna's bullet cutting as electrodes, which resulted in the electrodes dissolving and wasting a whole basin of salt water—because to prevent chlorine gas from dissolving in the water during electrolysis, the electrolyte is generally saturated brine, and salt was not cheap in this era. Thus, when pouring away the waste salt water that had copper ions and impurity precipitates dissolved in it, Roland felt as if he had thrown away several Gold Royals. The problem was finally solved after switching to carbon rods as electrodes.



After using caustic soda and boiling water to remove grease, obtaining degreased cotton gauze, he took the remaining caustic soda to the chemical laboratory.



The esterification of nitrocellulose is the most important step in the production process, the principle of which he was not clear about, only knowing that the gauze needed to be soaked in a mixture of acid solution, and once nitration was complete, it could be taken out. He did not know the ratios of the solution or the reaction time. Roland had Kyle divide into several teams to experiment, using an hourglass to control the time. The small pieces of gauze that had been soaked were repeatedly washed with water and then soaked in a sodium hydroxide solution to react away the excess acid. The damp finished product was transported back to the castle and given to Wendy to air dry.



Since a high concentration of fuming nitric acid was used during esterification, most of the trial products could be ignited quickly, and the nitrocellulose soaked with one part nitric acid to two parts sulfuric acid had the best effect. After obtaining a rough formula, the laboratory started mass production—the nitrocellulose that had completed soaking and washing was immediately taken away by the soldiers of the First Army, and even the Chief Alchemist did not know what the purpose of the products they were making was.



The air-dried gauze was cut by the maids into nail-sized squares, packed in boxes, and sent to the North Slope Mountain, where they were finally filled in the back yard of the firing room. Without machinery for fixed loading, this process could only be completed by manpower. The personal guards sat scattered, gently poking the glue-coated nitrocellulose gauze into the bottom of the cartridge case with a wooden stick, sealing the ignition hole, then pouring granular black powder into the cartridge case with a funnel, compacting it layer by layer, trying to keep the loading amount as consistent as possible for each one.



The last step was to press the bullet head on. The bullet heads processed by Anna fit the cartridge cases very well, and after pushing them in by hand, a few light taps with a hammer would suffice.



The process might be inefficient, but they could still produce around a hundred bullets a day. By the sixth day, Carter finally got to use the fully assembled new weapon. As the Chief Knight with excellent physical qualities, his accuracy had greatly improved after several days of repetitive practice, a stark difference from Roland's marksmanship during military training.



After switching to the flintlock fixed ammunition, Carter no longer had to adopt the strange shooting posture of holding his musket with his wrist drooping. As long as the nitrocellulose at the muzzle did not burst, the chamber would remain clean. Moreover, its sensitivity to sparks was several times higher than that of black powder, which also ensured a reliable firing rate.



Taking advantage of the last day, Roland had Carter Lannis practice quick-draw and dual-wielding shooting—a 12mm caliber pistol still has considerable recoil even when using black powder, and it's difficult to ensure accuracy with a second shot using one hand. However, in Roland's plan, this was a desperate counterattack for when one carelessly allowed an Ashes to close in.



Carter would carry two guns into battle. In a drawn-out fight, ten bullets would be enough to determine the winner, and if he was closed in on shortly after the battle started, he could quickly draw the other gun to counterattack. Furthermore, considering that the opponent's weapon had a certain defensive capability, Roland had specially chosen steel bullets that were hard to deform, increasing their penetrative power while reducing the hollow-point damage. With the limitations of the smelting technology of the time, Ashes' greatsword was likely cast from pig iron—its exaggerated shape did not equate to improved quality. On the contrary, such a large iron weapon, without sufficient forging, would have an even more uneven internal stress distribution, hardly making for a good shield. In Roland's view, a greatsword was at best a blunt weapon, and the likelihood of a ricochet was very low unless one was particularly unlucky.



For Ashes to defeat Carter, she first needed to get close to the knight, which was the innate disadvantage of cold weapons against firearms. Unless one could visually track the trajectory of bullets and dodge them in a blink, this distance was an insurmountable chasm.



...



It was not until the evening that Ashes waited for Maggie to fly back to the room.



"Why are you coming back later each day?" she asked as she closed the window.



"Lightning took me to catch birds," Maggie transformed back into her human form and took out a roasted bird leg from her waist pouch, instantly filling the room with its tempting aroma. "I saved it especially for you."



"I've already eaten," Ashes shook her head, "Is Lightning a witch from the Witch Union?"



"Mhm," she nodded vigorously, "Her ability is the same as mine, flight, but it's much more convenient to use." After pausing for a moment, she continued, "Ashes, do you really have to fight this battle? I feel... they won't go with you, and besides, they seem to be living quite well here."



Ashes was momentarily stunned, offering no reply.



"Because even I want to stay here," Maggie plopped down onto the bed, talking to herself, "The beds are soft, and the food is plentiful. I saw at lunchtime, the lord had specially arranged the dining table in the backyard, dining with the witches who had finished practicing. Everyone was talking and laughing, and he would occasionally join in the conversation, completely different from the detestable demeanor of other nobles. In the afternoon, Lightning even dragged me to play Gwent. It's a game where two people draw ten cards and compete against each other, and the one with the highest score wins. It's extremely interesting. They even gave me two sets of decks. Ashes, do you want to play a round? I'll teach you."



"No, thank you..." Ashes shook her head, taking a deep breath. She had noticed the changes in Maggie these days, but it wasn't until this moment that she suddenly realized she might have been thinking about it all wrong.



Most witches lived their lives in fear and trepidation, striving for a stable and comfortable place to call home. Take Maggie, for example, who, before being accepted by Tilly, always hid in the straw huts of the capital's slums, curling up in the narrow gaps between the roof beams like a real bird, spending each night. Even when Tilly decided to cross the sea to the east, Maggie traveled everywhere, connecting with witches hidden among the civilians, never resting for half a year. Such a peaceful and comfortable life was probably her first.



Wasn't it the same for herself? It wasn't until she met Tilly that she began to lead a life beyond her wildest dreams. Accustomed to the relatively calm life in the royal palace, she had overlooked the significance of this town to the witches—a sense of belonging. The attraction of a destination was incomparable in the eyes of witches. Their desire to stay here, to protect this territory, was probably just like her own desire to protect Tilly...



If Roland Wimbledon could truly hold off the crazed God's Punishment Army as he claimed, this place would undoubtedly be a better choice than the Fjords—establishing a witches' nation on a completely unfamiliar land sounded alluring, but no one could predict the hardships that would come with it.



But if he couldn't hold off the onslaught, should the witches leave?



Ashes's mood suddenly calmed down.



Thinking about it from another perspective, if Tilly couldn't establish a foothold in the Fjords, she would probably choose to stand by her side and protect her to the last moment. As the person who had given her a place to belong, she had no reason to leave first.



"This place is constantly under the threat of the Church, and if it can't withstand the God's Punishment Army, the fall of Border Town is only a matter of time."

There was indeed no need for this contest... but she still decided to complete it, as a warning or perhaps to prove something.

"What if they can hold back?" Maggie muttered.

"I hope so too, which is why I will help them verify this," Ashes said solemnly.

She closed her eyes, ready to give it her all.
