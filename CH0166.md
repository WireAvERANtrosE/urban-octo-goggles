## Eve of the Decisive Battle
On the fifth day as agreed, Roland finally prepared all the ingredients needed for making guncotton.



He made a serious mistake during the electrolysis of saltwater by using the leftover copper strips from Anna's bullet cutting as electrodes, which led to the electrodes dissolving and wasting a whole basin of saltwater—since the electrolyte for avoiding the dissolution of chlorine gas into water is generally saturated saltwater, and salt is not cheap in this era. When pouring away the waste saltwater with copper ion contaminants and sediment, Roland felt like he was throwing away several gold royals for nothing. The problem was eventually solved by switching to carbon rods as electrodes.



After boiling the cotton gauze with caustic soda to remove grease and obtain degreased cotton, he took the remaining caustic soda to the chemistry laboratory.



The esterification of guncotton is the most important step in the manufacturing process. He wasn't clear on the principle but knew that the gauze had to be soaked in a mixture of acids and taken out once nitration was complete. He was clueless about the solution ratio and reaction time. Roland had Kyle divide the work into several groups for experimentation, controlling the time with an hourglass. The small pieces of gauze that had been soaked were repeatedly washed with water and then reacted with a solution of sodium hydroxide to remove any excess acid. The damp product was transported back to the castle and handed over to Wendy to air dry.



Since a high concentration of fuming nitric acid was used for esterification, most of the trial products could be quickly ignited, with the guncotton soaked in a solution of one part nitric acid to two parts sulfuric acid yielding the best results. After obtaining a rough formula, the laboratory started mass production—the guncotton that had been soaked and washed was immediately taken away by soldiers of the First Army, and even the Chief Alchemist didn't know what use their creations would serve.



The air-dried gauze was cut into fingernail-sized squares by the maids, boxed, and sent to North Slope Mountain, where they were finally filled in the backyard of the firing room. In the absence of machine loading, this process could only be completed by hand. The guards sat scattered around, gently pushing the glue-touched guncotton squares into the bottom of the cartridge cases with a stick, sealing the ignition hole, then pouring the granular gunpowder into the cartridge cases with a funnel, compressing it layer by layer, trying to keep the loading amount as consistent as possible.



The last step was to press the bullet head in place. The bullet heads processed by Anna fit extremely well with the cartridge cases, and after being pushed in by hand, a few light taps with a hammer were all that was needed.



The efficiency was a bit low, but they could still produce a hundred or so bullets a day. By the sixth day, Carter finally got to use the fully assembled new weapon. As the Chief Knight with excellent physical attributes, his accuracy improved greatly after several days of repeated practice, a world apart from Roland's shooting performance during military training.



After switching to flintlock fixed ammunition, Carter no longer had to hold the musket in a strange shooting position with his wrist drooping. As long as the guncotton at the seal did not burst, the chamber would stay clean, and its sensitivity to sparks was several times that of black powder, ensuring a reliable firing rate.



Taking advantage of the last day, Roland had Carter Lannis practice quick draws and dual-wielding shooting—the recoil of the 12mm caliber handgun was considerable even with black powder, and it was difficult to ensure accuracy with the second shot when firing with one hand. However, in Roland's plan, this was a desperate counterattack in case Ashes closed in unexpectedly.

Carter would enter the battle with two guns. In a protracted fight, ten bullets were enough to determine the winner. If he was closed in on shortly after the start, he could quickly draw his other gun for a counterattack. Moreover, considering the defensive capabilities of the opponent's weapon, Roland had specially chosen steel bullets that were less likely to deform, increasing their penetration while reducing their cavity damage. With the limitations of the smelting technology of the time, Ashes' greatsword was probably made of cast iron—its exaggerated design did not equate to improved quality. On the contrary, the large iron weapon not properly forged meant the internal stress distribution was even less uniform, not making for a good shield. From Roland's point of view, the greatsword was at best a bare weapon, and there was a very low chance of ricocheting if luck wasn't particularly bad.

For Ashes to defeat Carter, she would first have to close in on the knight, which was the inherent disadvantage of cold weapons against firearms. Unless one could visually track the trajectory of bullets or instantly dodge them, this distance was an insurmountable gulf.

...

It wasn't until dusk that Ashes finally waited for Maggie to fly back to the room.

"Why have you been coming back later and later each day?" she asked as she closed the window.

"Lightning took me bird hunting," Maggie transformed back into human form and took out a roasted bird leg from her waist pouch, instantly filling the room with its tempting aroma, "I saved it especially for you."

"I've already eaten," Ashes shook her head, "Is Lightning a witch from the Witch Union?"

"Yes," she nodded vigorously, "Her ability is the same as mine, flying, but it's much more convenient to use." After a pause, she continued, "Ashes, do you really have to fight this battle? I think... they won't follow you, and besides, they live quite well here."



Ashes hesitated for a moment, but did not answer.



"Because even I want to stay here," Maggie plopped down on the bed and continued on her own, "The bed is soft, and the food is plentiful. I saw at lunchtime, the Lord set up the dining table in the backyard and dined with the witches who had finished practicing. Everyone was talking and laughing; he would occasionally chip in, completely different from the detestable demeanor of other nobles. In the afternoon, Lightning dragged me to play Gwent. It's a game where two people draw ten cards and compete against each other, and the one with the higher points wins. It's extremely interesting. They even gave me two sets of decks, Sister Ashes, do you want to play a round? I'll teach you."



"No, thanks…" Ashes shook her head and took a deep breath. She had noticed the changes in Maggie these days, but it wasn't until this moment that she suddenly realized that her own thoughts seemed to have fallen into a misconception.



Most witches live in fear and trepidation, scraping by day by day, and a stable and comfortable residence is all they pursue. Like Maggie, before being accepted by Tilly, she always hid in the thatched cottages of the capital's slums, curling up in the gaps of the roof beams like a real bird, spending each night. Even when Tilly decided to cross the sea to the east, Maggie traveled everywhere, connecting with the witches hidden among the common folk, without a moment's rest for half a year. Such an easy and peaceful life, she was probably experiencing it for the first time.



Wasn't it the same for herself? It was only after meeting Tilly that she began to live a life beyond what she had dared to dream of before. Accustomed to the relatively peaceful life in the palace, she overlooked the significance of the town to these witches—the allure of a home is incomparable in the eyes of witches. Their desire to stay here, to protect this land, was probably the same as her own desire to protect Tilly…



If Roland Wimbledon could truly hold back the frenzied God's Punishment Army as he said, this place was undoubtedly a better choice than the Fjords—establishing a witches' nation on a completely unfamiliar land sounded alluring, but in reality, who could predict the hardships involved?



But if he couldn't hold them back, should the witches leave?



Ashes's mood suddenly calmed down.



Thinking from another perspective, if Tilly could not make a stand in the Fjords, she would likely choose to stand by her side, protecting her to the last moment. As the one who gave her a home, she had no reason to leave first.



"The place is under the constant threat of the Church, and if Border Town cannot withstand the Divine Will army, its destruction is only a matter of time."

There really was no need for this competition... but she still decided to see it through, as a warning, or perhaps as proof.

"What if they can hold back?" Maggie muttered.

"I hope so too, which is why I'll help them verify that," Ashes said solemnly.

She closed her eyes, ready to give it her all.
