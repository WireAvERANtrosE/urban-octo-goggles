## Patch the leaks and fill the gaps.
"Do you think he will agree?" After Petro left, Nightingale asked in his ear.



"I don't know, and his agreement alone is not enough; we still need to convince Earl Hurlam," Roland took a sip of hot tea, "If he still intends to be a noble of his domain, then we can only express our regret."



"You'll miss him, won't you?" she teased.



"Of course, I will," Roland pursed his lips, "Among the nobles, he is neither pedantic nor opportunistic, and he is very adept at managing trade. Just let him train at Longsong Stronghold for a year or so, and he will definitely become an excellent official capable of governing a territory on his own."



"If he convinces Earl Hurlam, do you really plan to entrust him with managing the capital?"



"If I unify Greycastle, naturally the capital will have to be relocated... Moreover, cities too far from the Western Region are best managed by people dispatched from the Western Region, so the conditions I offered are not empty promises." At the end of the conversation, Roland revealed to Petro that from now on, he would not appoint any more nobles, and after integrating Greycastle, the entire kingdom would adopt the same laws and policies as in Border Town, all power centralized under the Crown. If he decided to stay, Longsong Stronghold was far from his final destination in politics. Managing a great city or becoming the chief bureaucrat of the Central Administration were both possibilities.



As for how far he could go, that would depend on his own abilities.



Roland hoped the other party would understand the expectations contained in his words.



"Alright, I can't figure these things out anyway," Nightingale patted his shoulder, "But the new witch is coming soon, so it's better for you to leave for a while."

"Are you going to question her alone?"

"I'll call Wendy over," the voice beside him chuckled, "She's better at this than I am."



For safety reasons (mainly proposed by Scroll), the Witch Union has to have Nightingale confirm the identity of any new witches. Since recognizing lies in her Mist state requires her to remove the Divine Stone of Judgement, Roland cannot be present in case the other party suddenly becomes hostile and causes an accident.



Scroll even came up with ten universal questions to identify witches, like "Where are you from," "What is your real name," "Do you know the prince," "Do you harbor hostility towards the prince," and so on. Considering that Nightingale can only judge the truthfulness of things she is certain about and can't see through lies that are believed without a doubt, these questions are designed to probe from every angle, leaving almost no room for deception. Even if one or two questions could be evaded, it would not be possible to answer them all perfectly.



Roland himself found this somewhat amusing but also helpless, considering that the witches were doing this out of good intentions, he just went along with them.



...



Leaving the reception room, he returned to his office and immediately summoned Barov, the Chief Administrator of the City Hall.



The report of the discovery of a new witch in the Longsong Stronghold made him realize his oversight. Although he had presented Nana on the platform of honors, formally declaring the existence of witches in the town, there had never been a decree directly stating the treatment and status of the witches. Therefore, the same situation that happened at the stronghold could occur in Border Townâ€”knowing one has awakened as a witch but still choosing to hide one's identity instead of stepping forward.



Barov had just entered the door when Roland ordered, "I want to issue a long-term recruitment notice, just follow the content written on this draft paper."

He took the draft document and quickly read through it, "You... want to recruit witches at a salary of one Gold royal per month?"

"That's right," Roland nodded, "This is also the standard salary of the Witch Union." A monthly salary of one Gold royal was definitely a top-paying job in this era. The salary level in the town was generally higher than other cities, with the starting salary of the highest-paid acid factory workers having climbed to twenty Silver royals, while that of witches was five times this amount. This recruitment not only clarified the treatment of witches but also affirmed their status.

"Why don't you mobilize the people to find them if you want to attract more witches?" Barov asked, "Just like before when you had the citizens denounce spies, they are the most sensitive eyes."

Now even the chief officer had learned the tactic of 'the vast sea of people's war,' the prince suppressed a laugh in his heart and waved his hand, "And then I should give them a bonus? Wouldn't that be exactly like what the Church does?"

"But... you are doing this to recruit witches, not to hang them."

"True as that may be, witches who are denounced by the public might think I am forcing them. You must know that the new witches in this area have not experienced persecution this year, which is incomparable to the situation of witches from outside," Roland said noncommittally, "I hope they will voluntarily step forward and contribute their strength to Border Town."

Besides the personal will of the witches, he was more worried that if the decree claimed that rewards would be given to those who find witches, and that rewards would be given for birthing witches, it might lead to a new round of "denunciations," or turn the birth of witches into a "business." Hard work not as good as giving birth to a witch, although it could significantly reverse the status of witches in the short term, in the long run, this policy would have an adverse effect on the 'hard work brings wealth' slogan promoted by Border Town. Therefore, a recruitment targeted solely at witches could effectively avoid this situation.

Barov had just bowed and retreated when Wendy followed in, handing over the results of her inquiry to the table, "Your Highness, the identity has been confirmed, and it matches what the eldest son of Golden Dragonflower said, there are no issues."



"Look," Roland said with a smile, "you are being too cautious."

"But this caution is necessary," Wendy insisted, "ensuring your personal safety is our top priority."

"Alright," his heart was suddenly touched, and he took a deep breath, "then bring her in."

The girl was about fifteen or sixteen years old, with dirty, dark brown hair and eyes filled with timidity and panic. It was probably her first time entering a carpeted room, and she didn't know where to place her hands and feet.

According to the results recorded on paper, she claimed to be called Blank Paper and was born on the outskirts of Longsong Stronghold. She became an orphan after a heavy snowfall three years ago, an experience probably similar to that of most wandering children in the Western Region. They either die fighting for food or join the Rat Gang, becoming thieves, enforcers, or scapegoats.

"You..." Roland didn't know what to say for a moment. She lacked Agatha's strong adaptability and was far from as mentally resolute as Anna. Even similar to Miya and Lily, they had the companionship of their sisters from the Mutual Aid Society. As a little girl in a strange place, she was probably still in a state of panic, and it would likely take her a long time to adapt to her new life. Moreover, from Petrov's report, her ability to quickly melt snow seemed to be related to temperature.

Anyway, testing her ability was not urgent, and he could slowly learn more through their interactions. With that thought, he looked at Wendy, "The long journey must have exhausted her, take her to have a bath and rest well for a while. Arrange her accommodation in the Witch Building, and as for the precautions related to magic power, I'll leave that to you to teach, is that okay?"

"Of course," she smiled, "as you wish."
