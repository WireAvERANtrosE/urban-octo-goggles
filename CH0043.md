"Where's Sister Anna?" 

Nana heard footsteps coming down the stairs and hurried to the door to look out, but was disappointed to find that it was Prince Roland.

"She's still at work, she'll probably come over later."

"Work?" Nana had recently often heard this word from the prince, "You mean burning that gray clay powder?"

"For now, yes."

Nana pouted and returned to the table. I have a job too, she thought, staying here, treating those who were injured in defence of the town.

"What, is it boring without Anna?" Roland laughed, pulled out a chair and sat down by the fireplace.

"Mhm." Nana propped up her chin and honestly replied. It wasn't that she didn't want to heal the injured, it's just... it's just too scary.

She still remembered the first time she treated Brian—the man's body was as if it had been soaked in blood, with red-brown clots congealed on his chest, his mouth opening and closing like a dehydrated fish, spitting out a mixture of red and white foam. Then... she fainted.



"What a disgrace."

Nana raised her head, sneakily glancing at Roland, only to find that he had already fallen asleep in his chair. It seemed that the prince was also tired, she thought. Building city walls, training soldiers, and protecting the town from demonic beasts were also his duties.

When he had asked her to come here, she hesitated for a long time, but she didn't refuse in the end.

"You will also encounter some things that make you want to survive, even if it means struggling to do so." — Nana didn't quite understand the meaning of these words, but when she closed her eyes, the image of Anna would appear in her mind — those deep blue eyes were like a lake, slowly surrounding her. This was also the reason why she agreed to Roland's request.

She wanted to become as strong as Sister Anna.

Suddenly, there were footsteps downstairs again. Nana jumped off her chair, wanting to see if Anna had returned, but an invisible hand stopped her.

"Wait, there's more than one person."

Nana patted her chest, complaining, "You scared me, Sister Nightingale."

The door was quickly pushed open, it was Brian who was responsible for guarding the first floor, "Miss Pine, please come down, someone has been scalded."



"It's time to work, isn't it?" Nana took a deep breath, "I understand." 



She went downstairs where two guards were busy lifting a man who was continuously screaming in pain onto a bed. There was a small figure beside them, his face full of anxiety. Brian stepped forward and quickly tied the patient's hands and feet to the bed. The guards then hoisted the small figure out of the room and casually pulled the curtain to act as a partition.



"What happened?" Roland asked as he rubbed his eyes and came downstairs.



"Your Highness, a seriously injured person was brought in from the Northern Slope Mine. It looks like he was scalded by something."



The prince walked over and took a look. "It's a steam burn. I hope there's no issue with Engine No.1. Where's the person who brought him?"



"In the hall." Brian pointed towards the direction of the main door.



"I'll go and inquire about the situation. You handle things here." With that, Roland headed towards the exit.



Nana slowly moved over to the injured man, stealing a glance at him. His facial features were all blurred into a mess, his skin, which should have been red, had turned a pale white as if dehydrated. Strands of it hung on his face like torn cloth. His neck was full of blisters, some of which had already burst, and the sticky fluid that was oozing out mixed with the blood, soaking a part of the pillow. Under the flickering light of the fire, he looked even more terrifying than a devil in a nightmare.



She took two steps back, closed her eyes, and when she opened them again, her father was looking at her with concern.

"Are you alright?"

Nana nodded, thinking of what Roland had told her—'Treat the wounded as if you were treating a small animal.' She went back to the bedside and extended her hands.

An incredible feeling surged from within her, slowly gathering in her palms. She saw a strand of liquid emitting a faint green glow flowing from her hand, dropping onto the injured person's face. Despite the obvious glow, others looked but did not see it. Then, the wound changed. The burned skin continuously peeled off, and new skin grew at a visible rate.

The injured person's painful moan gradually ceased, and their breathing became steady, as if they had fallen into a deep sleep.

Nana let out a breath. Her performance this time was a lot better than the last, wasn't it?

"My goodness, is this the healing ability His Highness mentioned? This is my first time seeing it," Titus Pine exclaimed, "My dear daughter, you're truly amazing!"

"It's simply the power of a deity," Brian also expressed his admiration, "Miss Nana, you were the one who helped me when I was injured. I'm truly grateful."

Ah, this fool, Nana covered her face. Didn't he know that it was Sister Nightingale who had snuck her out that day?



"When did that happen?" Titus asked in surprise, "Why didn't I know?"

"Cough... Her power has nothing to do with the gods, it belongs to the witch herself," Roland pulled back the curtain and returned to the room, coughing twice to change the subject, "How is the condition of the person who was brought in?"

"Basically healed," Brian said excitedly, "As if he wasn't injured at all! Your Highness, with Miss Nana's help, everyone has a chance to survive in the battles during the Evil Months!"

"As long as you don't die on the spot, it's not a problem to stay alive," the prince nodded, indicating Brian to wake the man up, "Your name is Ironhead, right?"

The man known as Ironhead sat up with a bewildered face, "Am I... am I dreaming?"

"Not at all," Roland said, "You are still alive."

"You are...! I've seen you in the square!" The man seemed to suddenly realize something, rolled off the bed, and knelt on the ground, "Fourth Prince, did you save me?"

"It's Miss Pine who saved you, she is a witch with healing abilities."

Nana felt a tightening in her heart, is it okay to say so directly that she is a witch? Sure enough, the other party's gaze towards her changed, "A...witch? Your Highness, they are not devils..."



"What nonsense are you spouting!" Titus stood up, grumbling discontentedly, "My daughter has nothing to do with the devil, she's the one who saved your life. Do you think a devil would lend you a hand?"



"No, no! Please forgive my rudeness," Ironhead immediately bowed his head deeply, "Thank you for saving my life, Miss Pine."

Nana suddenly felt inexplicably distressed, she wanted to rush out of the room, but a voice kept reminding her in her heart, 'be strong'.

After Ironhead was sent away, Titus asked worriedly, "Is this really okay, Your Highness? With this, I'm afraid my daughter won't be able to lead a normal life."

"Think on the bright side, Mr. Pine," the prince comforted, "Only by breaking the deadlock at this time, can Nana possibly gain real freedom in the future. Otherwise, as she grows older, she will be exposed one day, and I'm afraid she will have to live a life isolated from the world."

Real...freedom? Nana didn't know, she felt free now, but if what the prince said could be realized, could Sister Anna also leave the castle like her and return to Teacher Karl's academy?
