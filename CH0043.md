## Resolute
"Where is Sister Anna?"

Nana, hearing the thudding footsteps from the stairs, hurried to the door to look out, only to be disappointed to find that it was His Highness the Prince who had arrived.

"She's still working. She'll probably come over later."

"Working?" Nana had recently heard this word often from the Prince, "Do you mean burning that grey clay powder?"

"For now, that's what it means."

Nana pouted and returned to the table. I have work too, she thought, staying here, treating those who were injured defending the town.

"What, bored without Anna here?" Roland smiled, pulled up a chair and sat down by the fireplace.

"Mhm." Nana propped up her chin and honestly replied. It wasn't that she didn't want to heal the injured, it was just... just that it was too scary.

She still remembered the first time she treated Brian, his body drenched in blood like he had been soaked in it, with clumps of reddish-brown blood coagulated on his chest, his mouth like a dehydrated fish, opening and closing, spitting out a mix of red and white foam. And then... she fainted.



It's utterly embarrassing.

Nana lifted her head and stole a glance at Roland, only to find him already leaning back in his chair, snoring away. It seems that the prince is also tired, she thought. Building walls, training soldiers, protecting the town from demonic beasts, these must be his duties too.



When he had asked her to come here, although she hesitated for a long time, she ultimately did not refuse.

"You will also encounter things that make you want to live, even if it means struggling to survive." — Nana didn't quite understand the meaning of this sentence, but when she closed her eyes, the image of Anna would appear in her mind—those deep blue eyes like a lake, slowly enveloping her. That was also the reason she agreed to Roland's request.



She wanted to become as strong as Sister Anna.



Suddenly, footsteps were heard again from downstairs. Nana hopped off her chair, wanting to see if it was Anna coming back, but she was stopped by an invisible hand.

"Wait, there's more than one person."



Nana patted her chest, complaining, "You scared me, Sister Nightingale."



The door was quickly pushed open; it was Brian, who was responsible for guarding the first floor. "Miss Pine, please come down for a moment, someone has been scalded."



"This means work, doesn't it?"

Nana took a deep breath. "I understand."

She walked downstairs, where two guards were busy lifting a person who kept wailing onto a bed. There was also a short figure standing by, their face filled with anxiety. Brian stepped forward and swiftly tied the patient's hands and feet to the sides of the bed. The guards then escorted the short figure out of the room and also pulled the curtain that served as a divider.

"What happened?" Roland asked, rubbing his eyes as he came downstairs.

"Your Highness, a severely injured person has been sent from the North Slope Mine. It looks like some kind of scalding injury."

The prince glanced over. "It's a steam burn. I hope there's nothing wrong with the First Army's steam engine. Where is the person who brought him?"

"In the hall," Brian pointed towards the direction of the main door.

"I'll go and find out what happened. I'll leave this to you," Roland said and then headed towards the exit.

Nana slowly moved next to the person and glanced out of the corner of her eye. The features on his face were all blurred together, the skin that should have been red was now a ghastly pale white from dehydration, hanging off his face like tattered cloth. His neck was covered in blisters the size of bowls, some of which had already burst, the oozing fluid mixed with streaks of blood soaking a patch of the pillow. Under the flickering glow of the fire, his appearance was more horrifying than any devil from a nightmare.



She took two steps back, closed her eyes, and when she opened them again, her father was looking at her with concern.

"Are you alright?"

Nana nodded, recalling the words Roland had told her—"Just treat the wounded like you're treating small animals"—and moved back to the bedside, extending her hands.



An incredible sensation welled up inside her, gathering bit by bit in her palms. She saw a stream of liquid emitting a pale green glow flow from her hands, dripping onto the patient's face. Although the glow was so apparent, it went unnoticed by others. Then, the wound began to change—the burnt skin peeled away, and new skin grew at a visibly rapid pace.



The patient's pained moans gradually ceased, his breathing steadied, as if he had fallen into deep sleep.



Nana exhaled, feeling that her performance this time had probably improved a lot from the last.



"My goodness, is this the healing power His Highness spoke of? This is my first time witnessing it," Titus Pine exclaimed in amazement, "My dear daughter, you're truly amazing!"



"It's like the power of a god," Brian was equally moved, "When I was injured, it was also Miss Nana who lent a hand. I am so very grateful to you."



Ah, this fool, Nana covered her face, doesn't he know that it was Sister Nightingale who sneaked me out that day?



"When did this happen?" Titus asked in surprise. "How come I didn't know about it?"

"Cough... Her power has nothing to do with the divine. It belongs solely to the witch herself," Roland said as he pulled back the curtain and returned to the room, coughing twice to change the subject. "How is the condition of the person who was brought here?"

"He's almost fully recovered," Brian said excitedly. "It's as if he was never injured! Your Highness, with Miss Nana's help, everyone has a chance to survive the battles during the Evil Months!"

"As long as one doesn't die on the spot, their life can mostly be saved," the prince nodded, signaling Brian to wake the man up. "You're called Ironhead, right?"

The man known as Ironhead sat up, looking confused. "Am I... dreaming?"

"No," Roland said. "You're still alive."

"You are...! I've seen you in the square!" the man suddenly realized, flipping out of bed and kneeling on the ground. "Your Highness, the Fourth Prince, did you save me?"

"It was the young Miss of the Pine family who saved you. She is a witch with healing abilities."

Nana tensed up, wondering if it was really okay to reveal she was a witch so directly. As expected, the man's gaze towards her changed. "Witch... Your Highness, aren't they devils..."



"What nonsense are you spouting!" Titus stood up, protesting discontentedly, "My daughter has nothing to do with the devil; she is the one who saved your life. Do you think a devil would lend you a hand?"



"No, no! Please forgive my rudeness," Ironhead immediately bowed his head deeply, "Thank you for saving my life, Miss Pine."



Nana suddenly felt inexplicably uncomfortable; she really wanted to rush out of the room, but a voice inside her kept reminding her to 'be strong.'



After Ironhead was sent away, Titus asked with concern, "Is this really okay, Your Highness? In this way, my daughter may not be able to lead a normal life."



"Look on the bright side, Mr. Pine," the prince consoled, "Only by breaking the deadlock at this time can Nana possibly gain true freedom in the future. Otherwise, as she grows older, she will inevitably be exposed, and by that time, she may only be able to live a life in isolation."



True... freedom? Nana didn't know; she felt free now, but if what His Highness said could be realized, Sister Anna could also leave the castle like herself and return to Teacher Karl's academy, right?
