## Castle's bathhouse
The drama performance was a huge success.

Within two weeks, three performances of "Cinderella" were held, with many of the subjects watching more than once. If the premiere was attended by so many people due to publicity and announcements, the following two shows were entirely spontaneous. Some subjects even went to the City Hall to inquire when the fourth performance would be held.

Such a reaction was beyond Roland's expectations; everyone was completely captivated by the story, and almost no one raised objections about why a witch was helping Cinderella. By the time "The Crowing at Midnight" was performed next month, it was almost exclusively for the poor commoners, and it was uncertain what the serfs would think about the witches who helped them in the play.

Another cause for joy was that the troupe had settled down in the town and had come to accept the existence of witches—after three performances, Irene took the initiative to find Roland and asked him about the sudden "accompaniment" during the show, and Roland introduced her to Echo.

Under Nightingale's secret observation, although Irene was greatly surprised, she showed no signs of aversion or disgust. After regaining her composure, she became very curious, bombarding Echo with questions and asking her to demonstrate her sound illusion ability several times. As a result, Echo joined the troupe, becoming the master of music hidden behind the scenes—to avoid accidents, Irene only rehearsed with Echo when there was a need for sound effects, and the rest of the troupe was none the wiser. Unquestionably, the next drama would reach a new height in terms of richness of sound effects.

Another cause for celebration was that the castle was about to enter the era of running water.

The towering water tower stood in the castle's backyard; its frame was welded from iron in a triangular shape, with a two-meter diameter, three-meter high iron bucket at the top, featuring a float valve for extremely convenient control of the water level. The iron tower was welded by Anna, coated with a rust-proof layer by Soraya, and then, with the help of Hummingbird, most of its weight was removed to facilitate its erection on the pre-cast concrete base.

Due to the height of the castle, the water tower in the backyard was taller than the one by the Redwater River, nearing twelve meters, almost level with the top of the castle. To prevent it from collapsing, Roland also added tie rods to the tower, integrating it with the castle.

The steam engine was set up outside the backyard to supply water to the tower, with the source being the well in the castle's backyard. Upon closer inspection, this was already the third generation of the steam engine, with the major improvement being a significant reduction in noise pollution.



Each connection point on the steam engine was fitted with a gasket—this light blue gasket was the exact color of the sky depicted by Soraya, very soft and resilient, which greatly reduced the vibration and noise when the machine was operating. The interior of the cylinder and edges of the piston were covered in grassland hues, reducing air leakage while increasing work efficiency. Parts that were prone to tremors, such as the exhaust pipes, were all replaced with coated flexible hoses.



To protect the steam engine from the elements and further insulate against noise, Roland also specially built a small shed around it. The interior walls of the shed were painted by Soraya with a layer of honeycomb coating, acting as porous sound-absorbing material. Actual tests showed that even when running at night, the noise from the machine would not awaken those sleeping in the castle.



However, Roland's attempt to make the steam engine automatically feed itself ultimately failed. He had initially envisioned using the centrifugal governor's spinning balls to control the wooden box's trapdoor, so when the steam pressure dropped and the balls converged, the trapdoor would open, allowing the firewood inside the box to roll into the furnace. But this meant the governor had to be made very large; otherwise, the weight of the balls could not move the trapdoor. After much consideration, Roland decided to abandon the idea. The wooden box could at most be filled once with firewood, and after it was exhausted, it still required manual refilling. It seemed better to arrange for the water tank to be filled with water at regular intervals every day.



The final step was the household water piping—including the installation of taps, showers, pipes, and corresponding drainage.



Since the castle was not like the newly built brick houses in a residential area with reserved holes, the stone ceilings and walls made the renovation quite troublesome. This step alone took nearly a week. For the sake of a better and happier life, Roland personally directed Karl to transform one room on both the second and third floors into bathrooms.



Soraya's new abilities played a key role once again. After the drainage pipes were laid and the ground was coated with cement, she painted a thin layer of grassland on it. Not only did it have waterproofing effects, but stepping into the bathroom also felt like walking on the prairie. Inspired by this, Roland simply had her paint the entire room. The ceiling was the open blue sky with clouds, the four walls showed distant valleys and greenery, and the bathtub walls were crystal clear, like gemstones.



On the day the water system began operating, the prince called all the witches to the bathroom to experience this great achievement.



The water tank in the backyard was already filled with water, and when he turned on the tap, water gushed out through the pipes.



"From today onwards, there's no need to draw water from the well anymore," Roland declared proudly, "and there's no need to heat bath water every three days. Just stand under the shower and flip this switch."



"Eh? Where is this water coming from?" Lightning stuck out her tongue and licked the continuous droplets, "It's quite sweet."

Maggie poked her head out from beneath Lightning, imitating her, "Quite sweet, coo!"

Roland pressed down on the third person trying to lean in, Nana, "Anyone who wants to drink water must boil it first. The water flowing here is only for washing hands and bathing."

"Is this... the siphon principle, right?" Anna looked towards Roland, her lake-blue eyes sparkling.

"What's that?" Hummingbird raised her hand to ask.

Under the tutelage of the teacher Scroll, the witches in class had now developed the habit of raising their hands to ask questions.

"Elementary Physics says that when the liquid levels in two containers are different and the liquids are connected by a tube, regardless of the shape of the tube, under the action of the liquid's own gravity, there will always be a trend to maintain the levels even," Anna recalled and explained, "Our location is lower than the water tower, so the water keeps flowing here."

"Absolutely correct," Roland praised. Being able to connect the knowledge learned with practical situations, she truly was a genius.

"And what about this?" Nightingale asked curiously, pointing at the showerhead hanging above, "Why does it have so many small holes at the bottom?"



Roland turned the valve, allowing the fine droplets of water to spray out, "For the convenience of bathing. Just by standing under the shower, one can easily wash themselves."



"So you're saying, you've been fussing around in the castle for a week, just to make bathing more comfortable?" Lily pursed her lips, muttering softly, "True to the form of a noble who loves luxury and comfort."



"Lily!" Scroll frowned.



"It's fine," Roland waved his hand, indicating that he didn't mind, "The pursuit of pleasure is one of the driving forces of human progress, and I am certainly no exception."
