## Castle's bathroom
The theatrical performance was a great success.

Within two weeks, three shows of "Cinderella" were performed, with many serfs watching it more than once. If the first show attracted many viewers due to publicity and announcements, the following two shows were completely spontaneous. Some serfs even went to the City Hall to inquire when the fourth performance would take place.

Such a response delighted Roland beyond expectation. Everyone was completely captivated by the story, and almost no one raised objections about why a witch was helping Cinderella. By the time "The Cock Crows at Midnight" was performed next month, it was almost exclusively for the poor commoners, and it was uncertain what the serfs would think of the witches who helped them in the play.

Another cause for celebration was that the troupe had settled down in the town and accepted the existence of witches—after three performances, Irene took the initiative to ask Roland why there was a sudden "accompaniment" during the show, and Roland introduced her to Echo.

Under Nightingale's covert observation, although Irene was greatly surprised, she did not show any aversion or disgust. After recovering from her surprise, she became very curious, bombarding Echo with questions and asking her to demonstrate her sound illusion ability several times. Thus, Echo also joined the troupe, becoming the hidden master of music behind the scenes—to avoid accidents, Irene only rehearsed with Echo when sound effects were needed, and the rest of the troupe knew nothing about this. Without a doubt, the next play would reach a new pinnacle in terms of the richness of sound effects.

Another pleasing development was that the castle was about to enter the era of running water.

The towering water tower stood in the castle's backyard, with a structure welded from iron frames in a triangular shape, and the top connected to an iron barrel two meters in diameter and three meters high. The barrel had a float valve, which made it extremely convenient to control the water level. The iron tower was welded by Anna and then coated with an anti-rust layer by Soraya, and finally, with the help of the Hummingbird, most of its weight was removed, making it easier to erect and install on the pre-cast concrete base.

Due to the height of the castle, the water tower in the backyard was taller than the one beside the Redwater River, nearly reaching twelve meters, almost level with the top of the castle. To prevent it from collapsing, Roland also added connecting brackets to the tower, making the water tower and the castle one solid structure.

The steam engine was set up outside the backyard to supply water to the tower, with the water source being the well in the backyard of the castle. After careful consideration, this was already the third generation of the steam engine, with the most significant improvement being the substantial reduction of noise pollution.



At every joint of the steam engine, a gasket was added—this light blue gasket was the color of the sky drawn by Soraya, very soft and resilient, greatly reducing the vibration and noise when the machine was in operation. The cylinder interiors and the edges of the pistons were covered in the color of grassland, reducing leakage while improving efficiency. Parts prone to trembling, such as the exhaust pipes, were all replaced with coated hoses.



To protect the steam engine from sun and rain and further isolate noise, Roland built a small house around it, with the walls inside painted by Soraya with a honeycomb coating, serving as a porous sound-absorbing material. Practical tests showed that even when running at night, the noise of the machine would not wake the sleeping people inside the castle.



However, Roland's attempt to make the steam engine feed itself automatically ultimately failed. He had originally envisioned using the governor's flyballs to control the wooden box's trapdoor, opening the trapdoor when the steam pressure dropped and the flyballs contracted, allowing the firewood inside the box to roll into the furnace. But for this to work, the governor had to be very large, otherwise the weight of the flyballs could not move the trapdoor. After much thought, Roland decided to give up the idea. At most, the wood box could be filled once with firewood, and after it was exhausted, it still required manual refilling. It was better to arrange for someone to fill the water tank at regular intervals every day.



The final step was the installation of indoor plumbing—including faucets, showers, pipes, and the corresponding drainage pipes.



Since the castle was not like the newly built brick houses in a residential area with reserved holes, the stone ceilings and walls made the renovation quite troublesome. This step took nearly a week. For a better and happier life, Roland personally directed Karl to transform a room on both the second and third floors into bathrooms.



Soraya's new ability played a key role once again. After the drainage pipes were laid and the floor was coated with cement, a thin layer of grassland was drawn on it. Not only did it serve a waterproof function, but it also felt like walking on the prairie when entering the bathroom. Inspired by this, Roland simply let her paint the entire room. The ceiling was the vast blue sky with clouds, the four walls showed distant valleys and greenery, and the walls around the bathtub were crystal clear, like gemstones.



On the day the water system began operation, the prince summoned all the witches to the bathroom to experience this great achievement.



The water tank in the backyard was already filled with water, and when he turned on the tap, water gushed through the pipes.



"From today on, there's no need to draw water from the well," Roland declared proudly. "Bath water doesn't need to be changed every three days; just stand under the shower and pull this switch."



"Eh? Where is this water coming from?" Lightning stuck out her tongue and licked the continuously flowing droplets, "It's quite sweet."

Maggie poked her head out from beneath Lightning, imitating her, "Quite sweet, coo!"

Roland pressed down on the third head that wanted to come over, Nana, "Anyone who wants to drink water must boil it first. The water flowing from here can only be used for handwashing and bathing."

"Is this... the siphon principle, right?" Anna looked towards Roland, her lake-blue eyes sparkling.

"What's that?" Hummingbird raised her hand to ask.

Under the tutelage of Teacher Scroll, the witches now all had the habit of raising their hands to ask questions during class.

"Elementary Physics states that when two containers have different liquid levels, and you connect the liquids with a tube, regardless of the shape of the tube, due to the gravity acting on the liquid itself, there's always a tendency for the liquid levels to equalize," Anna explained while recalling, "Our position here is lower than the water tower, so the water will keep flowing to this spot."

"Absolutely correct," Roland praised. Being able to connect the knowledge learned with practical applications, she truly was a genius.

"What about this then?" Nightingale curiously pointed at the showerhead hanging high up, "Why does it have so many small holes at the bottom?"



Roland turned the valve, allowing the fine droplets of water to spray out, "For the convenience of bathing. Just by standing under the shower, one can easily wash themselves."



"So, you've been fussing around in the castle for a week just to make bathing more comfortable?" Lily pouted, murmuring under her breath, "As expected of a noble who indulges in luxury."



"Lily!" Scroll frowned.



"It's alright," Roland waved his hand, indicating he didn't mind, "The pursuit of pleasure is one of the driving forces of human progress, and I'm certainly no exception."
