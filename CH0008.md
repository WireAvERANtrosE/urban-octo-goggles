## Demon Moon (Part 1)
To develop well, one must take root here. If the land is poor, one can reclaim wasteland; if the territory is too small, one can expand outward; but if people leave, everything is just empty talk.

If a territory can be abandoned at any time, then who would want to settle there, and who would want to produce in peace?

After the assistant minister retired, Roland called for Carter Lannis, his Chief Knight.

"Take your men and find me some local guards, hunters, or farmers who have stayed in this place for over five years and have experienced the Months of Demons. It would be best if they have fought against demonic beasts."

The knight took his leave, and Roland rubbed his forehead, continuing to look through the summarized materials.

The main outputs of Border Town were minerals and animal pelts, with food being the major import, all of which were transported via the Redwater River directly to Longsong Stronghold or Willow Town. The minerals included all kinds of ores: iron, copper, sulfur, crystal, ruby, sapphire... This had completely surpassed the concept of associated minerals. He also remembered Anna once saying that the north slope mine was rumored to have been the lair of an unnamed underground monster, and even now, the bottom of the mine tunnels had not been fully explored.

Turning to the section on food, Roland frowned. Most of these minerals were sold to Longsong Stronghold, but the payment was not made with the kingdom's Gold Royals but with food. In theory, items like gems should be considered luxury goods, but after several years of trading, Border Town had not saved much surplus food, nor was its financial income well-off.

In other words, the annual output of Border Town's mining industry only exchanged for one year's rations for two thousand residents. Considering that the lord of this place before the prince's arrival was from the Longsong Duke's lineage, self-production and self-sale were somewhat understandable. After all, in their view, storing too much food in this place would only benefit those demonic beasts.

The fur trade, on the other hand, belonged to the local people themselves. They would venture west into the Misty Forest to hunt birds and beasts, either selling to buyers from Longsong Stronghold or to the residents of Willow Town. Border Town did not impose taxes on this trade, as it was essentially impossible to monitor.

Roland thought for a moment. Since he had come, the mineral output could no longer be offset with food. The branches of the Redwater River almost ran through the entire kingdom, and transportation was not considered blocked. With this transportation artery, even if Longsong Stronghold no longer provided food, he could purchase it from other places.

The premise was that he could hold back those damned monsters here, in Border Town.

Carter was quick to act, and by the next day, he had found two guards and a local hunter. "These two are the captains of the Border Town patrol, and they are responsible for lighting the beacon fires every year. This hunter claims he has fought against demonic beasts and has personally beheaded one."

The three of them bowed and saluted in unison.

Roland nodded and asked them to step aside, calling them up one by one.

"Your... Your Highness, the respected prince," the first guard called up was so nervous he could hardly speak clearly, "Brian and I... we are both from here, uh... when it snows, we... we will go to the beacon tower in the north slope mine. From there, we can see the movements of the demonic beasts at the earliest time. If they cross the Misty Forest, we will... light the beacon, retreat through the small path, and leave on the fast boats prepared beforehand."

"Since you are together, call your partner up to answer," Roland said, covering his face and shaking his head, "What do the demonic beasts look like, and can they be killed?"



Another guard, though also nervous, at least did not stammer, "Your Highness, it should be possible. They were originally just ordinary animals in the forest, but after being infected by the hellish aura, they became irritable and ferocious. However, they can still be killed. After the Months of Demons each year, the Longsong Stronghold would send out cavalry troops to clear the remaining demonic beasts on the road from the stronghold to Border Town."

"How long do the Months of Demons last?"

"Usually two to three months, varying... it specifically depends on the sun," Brian said.

"Depends on the sun?" Roland asked, puzzled.

"Yes," the guard explained, "Your Highness, you've only recently come to these parts, so you don't know. Once it starts snowing in Border Town, it won't stop until the sun regains its radiance and the snow melts."

"So the Months of Demons aren't over until the snow melts?" Roland reflected that the snow in Greycastle wasn't like that; it generally melted the next day and there didn't seem to be any change in the sun.

"Exactly, the longest Months of Demons I've experienced was two years ago, which lasted nearly four months, and many people didn't make it through."

"Why, doesn't the Longsong Stronghold have even a month's reserve of food?" Roland asked.

Brian's face turned somewhat grim, "They do. But at the time, the municipal officer responsible for supplies, Fereyno, said that the ore we produced in the autumn was only enough to buy three months' worth of food. The food for the fourth month had to wait until a new batch of ore arrived before it could be distributed. But the Months of Demons weren't over yet, and we couldn't leave the stronghold."

"I see... I understand now."

What a bunch of fools, cutting themselves off from the people. If the Longsong Stronghold treated these border residents with warmth, like a spring breeze, it wouldn't be easy for me to keep them here. But it seems that the bunch huddled behind the city walls are no good either. Roland motioned for the last person to come forward to speak, his face expressionless, but he made a note of the name in his heart.



The third person was strong and stood nearly six feet tall, which felt quite imposing to Roland. Thankfully, he knelt on one knee as soon as he stepped forward.

"You say you've killed demonic beasts before?"

"Yes, Your Highness," his voice was deep and hoarse, "One of the boar kind, one of the wolf kind."

"'Kind'?" Roland repeated, "What does that mean?"

"That's what the hunters call the demonic beasts, Your Highness. The more ferocious the animal before mutation, the more difficult it is to deal with after the mutation. And they greatly amplify their body's original advantages. For example, the boar kind, its back fur is extremely tough, and a crossbow can hardly penetrate it from fifty meters away. The wolf kind is even more cunning, with astonishing speed, and to kill it one needs to set traps in advance."



"The strong are stronger, the fast are faster," Roland nodded and said, "but they are still animals."

"That's right, they are not the most terrifying enemies," the hunter said, swallowing, "the most fearsome are the hybrids."

"They are the incarnations of devils, only hell could create such horrifying demonic beasts. I've seen one of the hybrids; it not only had the powerful limbs of a fierce beast but also a huge pair of wings on its back, allowing it to fly short distances. And it seemed to know where I was, no matter where I hid, it could always flush me out. It wasn't hunting, Your Highness, it was toying with its prey." The hunter lifted his clothes to reveal a huge scar extending from his abdomen to his chest, "I jumped into the Redwater River before I passed out, and that's how I survived."

"To think there are such monsters," Roland felt that this world was becoming more and more fantastical. A solid wall could block all the ordinary demonic beasts, but what about the ones that could fly? "Hybrids must be quite rare, right?"
