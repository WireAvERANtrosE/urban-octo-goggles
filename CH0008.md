## Demon Moon (Part 1)
To develop properly, one must take root in this land. If the land is poor, one can reclaim wasteland; if the territory is too small, one can expand outward, but if the people leave, all talk is empty.



If a territory might be abandoned at any time, who would be willing to invest in property there, and who would be willing to produce goods in peace?



After the ministerial assistant retired, Roland summoned Carter Lannis, his Chief Knight.



"Take your men and find me some local guards, hunters, or farmers who have lived here for over five years and have experienced the Evil Months. It would be best if they have fought against demonic beasts."



The knight took his leave, and Roland rubbed his forehead, continuing to review the compiled information.



The main outputs of Border Town were minerals and animal furs, with grain being the major import. All transportation was done via the Redwater River, reaching directly to Longsong Stronghold or Willow Town. The minerals included various oresâ€”iron, copper, sulfur, crystal, rubies, sapphires... This had completely surpassed the concept of associated minerals. He was reminded of Anna once saying that the northern mining area was rumored to have been the lair of some unknown underground creatures and that even now, the bottom levels of the mine shafts had not been fully explored.



Turning to the section on grain, Roland frowned. Most of these minerals were sold to Longsong Stronghold, but the stronghold did not pay with gold royals but instead used grain to offset the cost. Logically speaking, gems and the like could be considered luxury goods, yet after several years of trade, Border Town had neither accumulated much surplus grain nor had a healthy fiscal income.



In other words, the annual output of the mining industry in Border Town only amounted to one year of food for two thousand residents. Considering that before the prince's arrival, the lord of the area was from the Duke of Lion's lineage himself, it made sense to keep the business within. After all, in their eyes, any surplus grain would only serve to feed the demonic beasts.



The fur trade, on the other hand, belonged to the local people's own income. They would venture west into the Misty Forest, hunt various birds and beasts, and sell them either to the buyers from Longsong Stronghold or to the residents of Willow Town. Border Town did not tax this trade, as it was simply impossible to monitor.



Roland pondered for a moment. Since he had come here, the output of ores could no longer be offset with food. The branches of the Redwater River almost ran through the entire kingdom, and transportation was not considered blocked. With this transportation artery, even if Longsong Stronghold no longer provided food, he could still purchase it from other places.

The premise was that he could hold back those damned beasts here, in Border Town.

Carter acted quickly, and by the next day, he had found two guards and a local hunter, "These two are the captains of the patrol team in Border Town. They are responsible for lighting the beacon fires every year. This hunter claims he has fought against the demonic beasts and has personally decapitated one."

The three of them bowed in unison.

Roland nodded, gesturing for them to step aside and come forward one by one to speak.

"Your... Your Highness," the first guard called forward was so nervous he couldn't even speak clearly, "Brian and I are... are locals, uh... After it snows, we... we will head to the beacon tower in the northern slope mining area. There, we can... can observe the movements of the demonic beasts for the first time. If they cross the Misty Forest, we will... will light the beacon fire, retreat through the... the small path, and escape on the fast boats prepared beforehand."

"Since you're together, have your partner come up and answer," Roland said, shaking his head, "What do the demonic beasts look like, and can they be killed?"

The other guard was also very nervous but at least he didn't stutter, "Your Highness, it should be possible. They were originally just ordinary animals from the forest, though they have become irritable and ferocious due to being infected by the hellish miasma, but they can still be killed. After the Evil Months pass each year, Longsong Stronghold would dispatch a cavalry troop to clear any remaining demonic beasts on the land route from the stronghold to Border Town."

"How long do the Evil Months last?"



"It generally varies from two to three months... It specifically depends on the sun," Brian said.



"The sun?" Roland asked, puzzled.



"Yes," the guard explained, "Your Highness, you have just arrived here recently, so you are not aware. Once it starts snowing in Border Town, it will not stop until the sun regains its brilliance, and only then will the snow melt."



"So the end of the Evil Months is when the snow melts?" Roland recalled that at least in Greycastle the snow wasn't like that; it generally melted the next day, and he hadn't noticed any changes in the sun.



"That's exactly right. The longest Evil Months I've experienced was two years ago. It lasted nearly four months, and many people did not survive it."



"Why, doesn't Longsong Stronghold have more than a month's worth of food reserves?" Roland asked.



Brian's complexion turned somewhat sour, "They do. But at that time, the city official in charge of supplies, Fereyno, said that the ore we produced in the autumn was only enough to purchase food for three months, and the food for the fourth month had to wait until the new batch of ore arrived before it could be distributed. But the Evil Months had not yet passed, and we simply couldn't leave the stronghold."



"I see... I understand now."



Such fools who cut themselves off from their people. If Longsong Stronghold treated Border Town's residents with warm hospitality, it would not be easy for me to keep them here. But now it seems that the bunch of cowards hiding behind those stronghold walls are no good either. Roland summoned the last person to answer without showing any expression on his face, but he took note of this name in his heart.



The third person was strong and muscular, standing close to six feet tall, which imposed a great pressure on Roland. Fortunately, as soon as he approached, he knelt down on one knee.



"You say you've killed demonic beasts before?"



"Yes, Your Highness," his voice was deep and hoarse, "a boar kind, a wolf kind."



"'Kind'?" Roland repeated, "What do you mean?"



"It is the term hunters use for demonic beasts, Your Highness. The more ferocious the animal before mutation, the more difficult it is to deal with after. Moreover, they amplify their body's original advantages many times over. For example, the boar kind has extremely tough fur on its back, so tough that even a crossbow has difficulty penetrating it from fifty meters away. The wolf kind is even more cunning, with astonishing running speed, and setting traps in advance is necessary to kill it."



"The strong get stronger, the fast get faster," Roland nodded, "but they are still animals."



"Exactly, they are not the most terrifying enemies," the hunter swallowed and continued, "the most fearsome are the mixed kinds."



"They are the incarnations of devils, only hell could create such terrifying monsters. I've seen one of the mixed kinds; it not only had the strong limbs of a fierce beast but also a pair of huge wings on its back, capable of short-distance flight. And it seemed to know where I was, no matter how I hid, it could always drive me out. It wasn't hunting, Your Highness, it was just toying with its prey." The hunter lifted his shirt, revealing a huge scar stretching from his abdomen to his chest, "I survived by jumping into the Redwater River before I passed out."



"There are such monsters as well," Roland felt that this world was becoming more and more fantastical, a solid town wall could block all ordinary kinds of demonic beasts, but what about those that could fly? "Mixed kinds must be very rare, right?"
