## King's City Royal Court Council
Timothy Wimbledon sat on the throne, holding the ruby scepter in his hand, looking down at the ministers in the hall. 

This is the feeling I want, he thought, not squatting in the city of Valencia, entangled with merchants over trivial profits. 

He tapped the scepter, the pure gold handle making a crisp sound as it collided with the polished marble floor. Seeing everyone's gaze focus on him, he nodded, "Let's begin." 

"Your Majesty, I have an important matter to report," Sir Weimar, nicknamed 'Steel Heart Knight', responsible for the defense of the King's City, was the first to speak. 

"Speak." 

"Can the witch hunt be temporarily suspended? Your Majesty, the recent hunt has been growing out of hand. Yesterday, I heard that some commoners' daughters were arrested, insulted in the dungeons, and one died in her cell. It was later proven that they were not witches. The entire outer district is now in a state of panic. If this continues, I fear a mass exodus may occur." 

Timothy frowned. The witch hunt was his directive. The death of Wimbledon III had yet to be solved, but he never believed his father would commit suicide, especially not with that eerie smile before his death, which gave him the creeps. His father wore the highest quality God's Punishment Stone, and the church had also confirmed that the stone had not been tampered with or failed. Yet, none of these proved that witches were not involved. 

If it came to eeriness, no one was better than those witches. 

He turned his gaze to Barov, the man in charge of the hunt, also a henchman he had cultivated. The latter immediately stepped forward and said, "Your respected Majesty, it was just an accident, I have already punished the related personnel," he counted on his fingers, "the warden, the head jailer, the guards, all have been sentenced to ten lashes and a fine of twenty-five Silver Royals."



"One person died, three suffered cruel torture, and the villains just get a few whips and a fine?" Sir Weimar said coldly. "Moreover, who gave you the authority to adjudicate? Was it His Majesty's Prime Minister, Lord Barov, or the Minister of Justice, Sir Paholo?"



"Your Majesty! In these extraordinary times, I had to take extraordinary measures," replied Barov, kneeling on one knee and pleading, "Overlooking some insignificant setbacks, the witch hunt has been a great success. We have caught at least fifteen witches lurking in the King's City, who are currently under severe torture. We will soon find out if they are plotting anything against—you know, your father—no, I mean, if they are up to something."



Timothy glared at him, this fool almost let slip his intentions. Although most of the ministers standing in the hall could guess the true purpose of his actions, the official narrative had to remain that it was the Crown Prince, Herman, who killed the king, and this point was not to be disputed.



"Fifteen witches?" scoffed the Iron Heart Knight with a disdainful tone. "Very well, so the capital has become a grand haven for witches. In the previous years, the Church only captured six members of the Mutual Aid Society in the eastern forests of the kingdom. It seems that your lackeys are even more effective than the Church's Judgement Army."



"You...!"



"Enough!" Barov was a fool, and so were his underlings, Timothy thought angrily. If it weren't for the lack of available hands at the beginning of his reign, he would never have promoted such idiots. Even if one wanted to claim credit, it shouldn't be done by fabricating numbers. He feared that most of these fifteen were just like the unfortunate civilian women. He did not want the Church involved in this matter, but now he had no other choice. "Go to the church and summon Priest Farry. Have him verify the identities of these fifteen people. Stop all interrogations. Henceforth, every person you catch must be verified by the priest! If I hear again that your men cannot control themselves, I will throw you into the moat of King's City to feed the fish!"



"Uh, yes, Your Majesty."



"Do it now!"



After sending Barov out of the hall, Timothy turned to the Minister of Finance, "If any of these people have been wronged, including the previous three, issue compensation of two Gold Royals. For the one who died in prison, give it to their family." He paused, "Issue one more."



"As you wish," the Minister of Finance nodded.



"Your Majesty is merciful," Sir Weimar also paid his respects.



"Next topic," Timothy exhaled a breath of stale air, and seeing that no minister below spoke up, he took the initiative, "Since no one has new issues to discuss, I will speak." He looked towards the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Sir "Umbrella" Brint, "The recall order has been issued for over a month, and yet not a single person has returned to the King's City. Tell me, what is the situation now?"



Sir Brint, from the Felin family, had held his position for thirty years. His hair was graying, and his face aged, one foot already in the grave. He cleared his throat, "Your Majesty, there has been no news from your third sister, Grace Wimbledon. As for your fourth brother, Roland Wimbledon, there has been a reply. The letter states that once the Evil Months are over and his subjects are safe and sound, he will consider returning to the King's City. However..."



"However what?"



"He addressed you as 'Your Highness' on the envelope, not as 'Your Majesty' or 'King.'"



Timothy could not help but scoff. Still as ignorant as before, my hopeless brother. He thought, if you plan to return, then properly acknowledge me as your king, and I might grant you a fine position, to live in comfort as a prince. But if you don't return, then prepare for your last desperate struggle. Look at what you've done, indecisive in your moves, wanting to come back yet unwilling to submit? What good is it to earn a quick wit?



"Let him be," Timothy waved his hand, "What about the fifth sister?"



"Your Majesty, she... has disappeared."



"What? Gone? What do you mean by that?"

"She first agreed to the envoy I sent, but a week later, Her Highness disappeared from the palace, along with her butler and two maids. I've arranged for people to search for her, but to this day, there's no news of her whereabouts."

What is this outcome? One by one, do they all so unwilling to believe in me? Timothy felt as if his heart was blocked. He had great expectations for his sister, hoping she could assist him. After all, Tilly had always been exceptionally bright since she was young, even outshining him. The only thing she lost to him was that she was a girl.

Timothy was very confident in her, and from the arrangements made by their father, he did not intend to involve Tilly in this turmoil. The territory given to her was Silver City, not far from the capital. The trade there was mediocre, without the foundation to support an army. Who would have thought that his fifth sister would run away?

Is this the choice of a smart person?

"Since she has run away, let the former lord continue to take charge of managing Silver City. The search must also continue; I cannot allow a royal bloodline to wander among the common folk." He gritted his teeth, suppressing the irritation in his heart, "So now, only my third sister refuses to comply, right?"

"Yes, Your Majesty."

"Given her stubbornness, I have no choice but to take more forceful measures," Timothy looked towards the Prime Minister, Marquis Wick, whose agreement was necessary to issue a war order, as both the king and prime minister's consent were needed. He was his biggest supporter, so there should be no problem, "I plan to have Duke Ryan of the Southern Border dispatch troops to force Grace to give up Clearwater Harbor and escort her back to the capital."

As expected, Marquis Wick responded, "This matter should not be delayed. Please issue the war order at your earliest convenience, and let the Foreign Minister take care of the handover."



Timothy nodded with satisfaction, ready to summon the secretary to draft the document, when suddenly the sound of urgent hooves came from outside the hall. After a burst of commotion, a knight clad in a blue-striped cloak pushed open the doors and strode into the hall.



Timothy recognized him, the renowned "Coldwind Knight," Mayne Moore. He walked directly to the center of the hall and knelt on one knee. "Your Majesty, I have just received news from the south," he panted, his voice anxious. "Your sister, Garcia Wimbledon, defeated Duke Ryan Koll five days ago and took over the City of the Hawk! And... she has declared herself Queen of Clearwater, with many lords responding to her call. The entire southern territory has now declared independence!"
