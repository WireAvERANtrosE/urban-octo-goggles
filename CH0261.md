## Gift
After dinner, Nightingale returned to the bedroom with the box in hand. Before she could even open it, Lightning, Maggie, Lily, and Miya also bounded in, their eyes gleaming as they stared at the cardboard box in her hands.



"What's the matter?" Wendy couldn't help but laugh. "Want to see what it is?"



Everyone nodded except for Lily.



"His Highness is playing favorites!" Lightning grumbled. "It's bad enough that we're not allowed to drink, but why don't we get gifts either?"



"He said it's only for adult witches," Lily sighed. "Just ask him for a present when you come of age. Besides, I don't care at all about what's inside. Why did you drag me over here?"



"Eh," Miya looked confused. "I only called out to you, I didn't pull you here."



"I—"



"Stop, that's not the point!" Lightning interrupted. "Miya is an adult, Maggie is an adult too, but they didn't get anything either!"



"That's right, coo," Maggie brushed aside the white hair covering her face and lifted her chin in protest. "I didn't get anything, coo!"



"This... His Highness must have his own considerations," Nightingale also felt somewhat puzzled. Previously, Roland never treated anyone differently, so why were the gifts selectively given this time? "Let's take a look at what's inside first."



Opening the box, they saw a strange 'garment' come into view—it looked like a few strips of cloth and a pouch put together, feeling very soft to the touch. It was clearly made of high-quality satin, but it didn't seem like a piece of clothing at all because it was just too small.



"There's a piece of paper underneath," Lightning called out.



Nightingale spread out the paper and found that it contained an introduction to the gift and instructions for use, with illustrations beside them.



"Uh..." Wendy also started to open her own box, "Is this thing called a brassiere?"



"...It can alleviate the weight on the chest, promote blood circulation, stabilize posture, while also reducing the discomfort of friction." Nightingale's voice grew lower and lower, feeling her cheeks suddenly becoming hot. Was this thing really for supporting the chest? She couldn't help but look towards Wendy, only to realize that all the other witches had also turned their gaze on her, showing an expression of sudden realization.



"Pfft," Lily couldn't help but laugh, "Now you know why you didn't receive a gift, right? Tsk tsk, I take back what I said before, even after Lightning grows up, she might not get this gift."



"As if you'd get one," Miya glared at her.



"I wouldn't want it anyway," the latter retorted with a roll of her eyes.



"Is this like a corset?" Only Lightning was completely unmoved, her eyes filled with curiosity and envy, "Can you wear it for me to see?"



"Of course not!" Wendy rarely showed an embarrassed expression, and after driving the four of them out, she finally breathed a sigh of relief, "Why would His Highness suddenly... give us these?"



Nightingale also felt a bit embarrassed; giving undergarments was one thing, as everyone's clothing and supplies usually came from the castle, and no one had ever felt awkward about it. But this clearly needed to be fitted for different people's sizes, meaning that Roland had been carefully observing each person's... measurements before this? The thought made her blush and she couldn't help but want to hide in the mist.



Right, what would Anna do?



"I'll be back in a moment," Nightingale said as she unfolded the mist, walked through the wall, and hesitated at the door to Anna's bedroom before deciding to knock and enter.



The door was quickly opened, and Anna, wearing a robe, looked as usual, "What's the matter?"



"Um, I wanted to ask..." Nightingale entered the room and closed the door behind her, "What do you think about the gift His Highness gave you?"



"I've already put it on, it's quite convenient."



The answer caught her off guard, "You've already put it on?"



"Mm," Anna nodded, "Do you want to have a look?"

"No, no need," she waved her hands frantically, hesitating, "I just wanted to ask, don't you find it strange to receive this?"

"Why?" Anna said, puzzled, "His Highness also said that he wants to promote this and sell it to more people as a commodity, so he needs us to help him try it on. And this is pretty good," she patted her chest, "It's both soft and light. Apart from the hooks at the back being a bit inconvenient to take off, it's much better than wearing an extra layer of underwear."



So that's how it is... Nightingale couldn't help but sigh inwardly. She hadn't paid attention to these trivial things, but had focused on His Highness's goals. Maybe that was what made her different, pure and direct. As a gift from Roland, Nightingale knew she would try it no matter what, so why be so shy about it? It was the same before, there was no need to hide and sneak around, she should have just confidently told him her thoughts—Anna would certainly do that, wouldn't she?



With that thought, Nightingale returned to her own room, picked up the brassiere to study it for a while, fastened it in the Mist, then put on her coat over it and reappeared in front of Wendy.

"It's a bit big," she tried jumping, "but wearing this is indeed a lot more comfortable. At least I don't have to always worry about the clothes being too rough and chafing painfully against my chest. Plus, it doesn't restrict movement at all, and I can do without the chest-binding cloth bands, which is quite convenient... You should try it too."

"No, I'd rather not..." Wendy shook her head.

"How can you say no," Nightingale chuckled as she pulled her into the Mist, "I always feel that His Highness designed this garment with you in mind."



Sylvie felt that she had seen more unusual things today than she had in the past few years.

Pipes that could flow water with just a flick of a switch, soap that emitted a faint fragrance, and a white liquor that burned the throat like fire—and to think that Evelyn was able to accompany His Highness in drinking all three cups?

Of course, the most incredible thing was the clothing given after dinner... She knew that it was indeed a practice among the nobility to give corsets, but usually, they would at least be paired with a waist-clinching dress. There was no reason to directly give such an item. And even if it was to be given as a gift, the recipient was usually someone very intimate... such as a lover.

But from what His Highness implied, not only did he intend to give intimate clothing to the witches, but he also planned to promote it and popularize it in the Western Region? Sylvie couldn't help but shiver. Which noble would choose to personally engage in this business, or could it be... that he had an unusual interest in breasts and buttocks?

After Nightingale pulled Wendy into the Mist, she could only vaguely see two blurry shadows floating by the bedside—it was clear that after spending so much time without coming out, Wendy had most likely accepted the gift under the former's instigation and encouragement. What about the other witches? Did they not understand the implications of giving intimate clothing?

Remembering Ashes' warning, Sylvie couldn't help but swallow.

She was right—His Highness was a dangerous person, and if possible, it would be better for her to stay away from him.
