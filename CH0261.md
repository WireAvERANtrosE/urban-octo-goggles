## Gift
After dinner, Nightingale returned to her bedroom with the box. Before she even had the chance to open it, Lightning, Maggie, Lily, and Miya also rushed in, their eyes shining brightly as they stared at the paper box in her hands.



"What's up?" Wendy couldn't help but laugh. "Want to see what's inside?"



Everyone nodded except for Lily.



"His Highness is playing favorites!" Lightning grumbled. "It's bad enough we can't drink, but why don't we get gifts either!"



"He said it's only for adult witches," Lily sighed. "Just ask him for one when you come of age. Besides, I don't care at all about what's inside, so why drag me over here?"



"Eh," Miya interjected, puzzled. "I only called out to you, I didn't pull you over."



"I—"



"Stop, that's not the point!" Lightning cut in. "Miya is of age, Maggie is too, but they didn't get anything either!"



"That's right coo," Maggie pushed back the white hair covering her face and raised her chin in protest, "I didn't get anything coo!"



"This... His Highness must have his own considerations," Nightingale also felt somewhat strange. Before, Roland had never treated anyone differently, so why were the gifts selectively given out this time? "Let's take a look at what's inside first."



Upon opening the box, a strange 'garment' came into view—it looked like a few straps and pouches put together, feeling very soft to the touch, evidently made of high-quality silk satin. However, no matter how one looked at it, it didn't seem like a piece of clothing, as it was simply too small.



"There's also a piece of paper underneath," Lightning called out.



Nightingale spread out the paper and found an introduction to the gift and instructions for its use, with illustrations beside the methods.



"Uh..." Wendy also started opening her own box, "Is this thing called a bra?"



"...It can relieve the weight of the breasts, promote blood circulation, stabilize posture, and at the same time reduce the discomfort caused by friction." Nightingale's voice grew softer and softer as she felt her cheeks suddenly heat up. This thing was actually used to support the chest? She couldn't help but look towards Wendy, only to notice that all the other witches had also turned their gazes towards her, showing expressions of sudden realization.



"Pfft," Lily couldn't help but laugh out loud, "Now you know why you didn't get a gift, huh? Tsk tsk, correcting what I said earlier, it's very likely that Lightning won't get this gift even after she grows up."



"As if you'll get one either," Miya glared at her.



"I don't fancy it at all," the latter retorted with a roll of her eyes.



"This is like a corset, isn't it?" Only Lightning was completely unfazed, her eyes filled with curiosity and envy, "Can you wear it for me to see?"

"Of course not!" Wendy showed a rare embarrassed expression, and after shooing the four of them out, she finally breathed a sigh of relief, "Why would His Highness suddenly... give us these?"

Nightingale also felt somewhat embarrassed. It was one thing to give undergarments, as everyone wore items taken from the castle without feeling ashamed. But this clearly had to fit different sizes to be wearable, which meant that Roland had been carefully observing everyone's... measurements before this? The thought made her blush and she couldn't help but want to hide in the Mist.

Right, what would Anna do in this situation?

"I'll step out for a moment, will be right back." Nightingale said as she unfolded the Mist, passed through the wall, and hesitated for a moment at the door to Anna's bedroom before deciding to knock and enter.

The door was quickly opened, and Anna, dressed in a robe, looked as usual, "What's the matter?"

"Uh, I wanted to ask..." Nightingale entered the room and turned to close the door, "What do you think of the gift His Highness gave you?"

"I've already put it on, it's quite convenient."

The response caught her off guard, "You've already put it on?"



"Mhm," Anna nodded. "Do you want to have a look?"



"No, no need," she waved her hands frantically, hesitating, "I just wanted to ask, don't you find it strange to give this as a gift?"



"Why?" Anna asked, puzzled. "His Highness also said that he wants to promote this and sell it to more people as a product, so he needs our help to try it on. And it's quite nice," she patted her chest, "soft and light. Besides the hooks at the back being a bit inconvenient to take off, it's much better than wearing an extra layer of underwear."



So that's how it is... Nightingale couldn't help but remark inwardly. She had not paid attention to these trivial matters, focusing instead on the prince's goals, which might just be what set her apart—pure and direct. As a gift from Roland, Nightingale knew she would try it on no matter what, so why be so coy? It was the same before, there was no need to hide and seek, she should have just boldly shared her thoughts with him—Anna would certainly do so, right?



With that thought, Nightingale returned to her room, picked up the bra, studied it for a while, fastened it in the Mist, and then put on her outer garment before reappearing in front of Wendy.



"It's a bit big," she tried jumping a bit, "but wearing this is indeed much more comfortable. At least I don't have to worry about the clothes being too rough and chafing my chest. And it doesn't hinder movement at all; I can even do away with the chest binding cloth. It's quite convenient... You should try it too."



"No, I'd rather not..." Wendy shook her head.



"How can you not?" Nightingale laughed lightly as she pulled her into the Mist, "I always felt that His Highness designed this garment with you in mind."



Sylvie felt that she had seen more peculiar things today than she had in the past several years combined.

Pipes that could produce water simply by pulling a lever, soap that emitted a faint fragrance, and a clear liquor that burned the throat like fire—which even Evelyn managed to drink three glasses of alongside His Highness?

Of course, the most unbelievable thing was the garment presented after dinner... She knew that it was indeed a practice among nobles to give corsets as gifts, but they usually came with a waist-cinching dress, not just the corset by itself. And even as a gift, the recipient was typically someone very close... such as a lover.

But from what His Highness implied, he intended not only to give undergarments to witches but also to promote it broadly, popularizing it throughout the Western Territory? Sylvie couldn't help shivering at the thought. Which noble would choose to personally engage in such a trade, unless... he had an unusual interest in breasts and buttocks?

After Nightingale pulled Wendy into the Mist, Sylvie could only vaguely see two blurred figures of light moving back and forth beside the bed—having not emerged for so long, it was clear that Wendy had most likely accepted the gift under the former's instigation and encouragement. What about the other witches? Did they not understand the implications of giving undergarments?

Remembering Ashes' warning, Sylvie couldn't help swallowing.

She was right—His Highness was a dangerous man, and if possible, it would be better for her to keep her distance from him.
