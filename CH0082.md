## Maiden Voyage of the Border Town
Lightning, as the only professional with experience at sea, naturally took on the role of pilot.



In fact, she was also very interested in this oddly shaped, strangely material barge. Although it looked extremely crude, it had all the necessary parts that a ship should have. Whether it could actually move, however, she was unsure. After all, most of the time at sea she had been merely an observer, as her father always refused her requests to personally take the helm or hoist the sails.



Following the tradition for a new ship's maiden voyage, Lightning smashed a jug of barley wine on the bow, and then ordered the sails to be hoisted. Carter, as the commander, naturally did not want to let the little girl take his place, so after she shouted her command, the knight would always follow with the same order.



The sails of the "Littletown" were stitched together from animal hides, with cowhide and sheepskin making up the majority, along with some of Border Town's specialties, such as wolf and bear hides. As a result, they appeared in varying shades of brown, white, and gray, like a patchwork of tattered cloth. The sail was trapezoidal, with four wooden sticks serving as crossbeams in the middle. The ropes passed through the iron rings at the top of the mast and hung down on the deck. By pulling the ropes, the entire sail could be raised.



To make operation as simple as possible, the "Littletown" had only a single sail on both the fore and aft masts, parallel and perpendicular to the centerline. If a normal two-masted ship were set up like this, it would result in one of the sails getting very little wind, almost equivalent to losing its function. However, with Wendy's ability to control the wind, such a design instead allowed the power to be evenly distributed on both sides of the centerline, making it more convenient for the helmsman to steer.



Seeing that the sails had been hoisted, Lightning commanded the workers on land to untie the hemp ropes. The weather at the time was still alright, with occasional snowflakes falling from the sky, and with the push of the light breeze and the current, the ship slowly left the shore.



The little girl landed beside Iron Axe and shouted, "Hard to starboard!"



Carter also followed with a shout, "Hard to starboard!"



"Uh, what does 'hard to starboard' mean?" Iron Axe scratched his head, "Turn right several times?"



"No, turn left all the way to the end," Lightning said with her hand to her forehead. "Never mind, I'll do it."



She had forgotten that this bunch was operating a sailboat for the first time and didn't even understand the basic commands. If this had been a standard two-masted sailboat, they probably wouldn't have even unfurled the sails by now. That there were less than ten people yet managed to smoothly set the stone boat off the shore could only mean that the design of the 'Littletown' was indeed exceptional.



She gripped the helm, which was taller than herself, lifted her feet off the ground, and turned to one side—the huge horizontal steering wheel was very heavy for an ordinary woman. Without mechanical assistance, it was equivalent to overcoming the resistance of water to move the entire iron rudder below the ship. But none of this was a problem for the flight-capable Lightning. She noticed that there was a stop piece underneath the helm to prevent it from turning too far and couldn't help but feel curious. She had heard that the prince himself designed this ship; why would he understand such details so clearly? Even sailors who spend years at sea may not be aware of the structure of each part of a ship.



"Sister Wendy, start the wind," Lightning called out.



Wendy stood on the roof of the cabin, a wry smile on her face. So, this was why His Highness had asked if she had a fear of heights. To use her to propel a sailboat? Thinking of the usual tasks she performed, like air-drying meat or blowing clothes dry, she suddenly felt a subtle sense of contrast. She spread her arms and entered the state she practiced daily, letting the wind blow evenly from below her feet and above her head, trying to make the wind force on both sails as equal as possible.



Truth be told, Wendy did not expect this seemingly simple request to be so difficult to execute.



Even though she had awakened as a witch fifteen years ago, she had never tried to deeply understand and control her power. Whether summoning a rapid gust of wind to wrap around a stone to attack the enemy, or calling up a whirlwind to sweep the enemy away, it was all about releasing a large amount of magic power in one go. And when dealing with chores at the camp, the wind was sometimes strong and sometimes weak, as long as it got the job done. Now, recalling Anna's serious demeanor during practice, Wendy suddenly felt a bit ashamed.



"What you need to do first, is to repeatedly practice your ability until you have full mastery over it—just like Anna."



It turned out that this was not just a platitude.



So let's get started right now... She took a deep breath and focused all her attention on sensing the wind.

Despite the wind not being completely balanced, the sails still bulged out, and the continuous thrust made the mast creak, as the bow began to swing to the right.

"It's actually moving," Carter exclaimed.

"His Highness turned a stone into a ship, and even made it float on the water," Titus said with a laugh, stroking his stubble, "Is there anything he can't do?"

The "Littletown" was getting farther and farther from the riverbank, gradually sailing in the middle of the river.

Wendy could only generate wind out of thin air but couldn't make the existing north wind disappear. Under the influence of both forces, the ship's direction of progress was not a straight line and had to be adjusted by turning the rudder. Lightning couldn't explain this clearly; it could only be experienced personally by Blowing. To help him grasp this feeling quickly, the little girl first directed him to make several large rudder changes to feel the relationship between the steering wheel's rotation angle and the bow's swing amplitude, then make further fine adjustments.

After sailing on the Redwater River for more than half an hour, Wendy was the first to falter.

It wasn't that her magic power was exhausted, but her body had reached its limit.

Even bundled up like a rice dumpling, she couldn't completely fend off the chill of the cold wind. A thin layer of snowflakes had accumulated on her cotton hat, and her hands and feet were so cold that they were nearly numb, standing on the canopy staggering. If it hadn't been for Lightning spotting something amiss while cruising in the air, she might have kept going until she passed out.



Lightning swiftly flew to Wendy's side, grasped her body, and simultaneously shouted for Blanche to head to shore.

The latter cranked the steering wheel to the right, causing the ship's bow to slowly veer to the left. Lightning also descended with Wendy onto the deck where only one sail could catch the wind, but at least it provided temporary shelter from the cold, preventing rapid loss of body heat. Moreover, docking, which required precise control, was not something Lightning dared to entrust to a novice who had just learned how to steer—although she was not much more experienced herself.

After some struggle, the "Littletown" finally docked, and everyone's hearts lifted at the moment of collision with the riverbank. The ship made a dull thud upon impact, but thankfully, it seemed to have sustained no serious damage. The group quickly gathered the sails and set up a gangplank to disembark.

Fortunately, during their trial sail, they had not chosen to follow a straight course to the end but had turned around in a spacious part of the river to practice, so the "Littletown" had not strayed too far from their departure point.

Lightning carried Wendy and flew directly toward the castle, while Carter looked at the stone ship and sighed. Without the help of the witches, there was no way they could bring the ship back to the dock.
