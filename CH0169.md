## Farewell
In the office, she saw Roland Wimbledon again, who was engrossed in writing something, probably dealing with state affairs. By this time, the sun had already tilted westward, dyeing the sky with a touch of golden yellow. The afterglow streamed through the floor-to-ceiling windows, leaving a long shadow on the desk.



Only when the prince set down his quill did Ashes speak, "I won."



"Indeed, you have won," he nodded curtly.



His straightforward attitude surprised her; she had thought Roland would offer some sort of excuse, but he readily acknowledged the outcome.



"But I admit you have the ability to fight against the God's Punishment Army," she said. "The God's Punishment Army is not invulnerable. Their strength and bodies are similar to mine, but they lack consciousness and the ability to think—that's also why I was able to handle three of them at the same time. If it were the earlier competition, and the knights were to face the God's Punishment Army, I think they would only charge head-on. Therefore, the God's Punishment Army cannot be deployed alone like the Judgement Army. If I'm not mistaken, the Church needs to send people to lead them in battle."



"Thank you," Roland smiled. "This information is very important."



"What is the new weapon in the hands of the knights?"



"A repeating rifle," he said. "In the future, all my soldiers will use this weapon. Even a farmer without a single inch of iron can defeat a well-trained Judgement Army soldier with a rifle."



Hesitantly, Ashes asked, "Can you give me a rifle?"



"Unless you join the Witch Union," Roland spread his hands, "after all, such things are still very rare for now."

Her refusal was expected. She exhaled, "I must meet with Tilly as soon as possible. I will leave Border Town early tomorrow morning. If you can't hold on, you can move to the Fjords for refuge."

He nodded, "The same goes for you, don't forget to tell my dear sister that there's still a place for witches to shelter in the western region of Greycastle."

"..." Ashes fell silent for a moment, "I will consider it."

Just as she was about to leave the office, the prince called out to her, "Wait, I have a gift for you, it's behind the door."

A gift?

She was taken aback, turned around, and saw a huge longsword placed by the door—since it was obscured by the door panel, she hadn't noticed it when she came in.

"Your longsword is no longer usable, so I had Anna forge a new one for you. This is not a low-quality iron sword, but one made of pure steel."

Indeed, it was uniformly smooth and shiny, reflecting an orange-red metallic luster in the sunset that was about to fall. She stepped forward and gently touched the great sword, noting the even thickness of the blade and the traces of tempering on one side of the edge. Without a doubt, this was a weapon of excellent quality. What puzzled Ashes was its design; unlike the double-edged standard swords, it had a single-edged blade with the other side about as wide as a little finger, with no point and a trapezoidal head. Most peculiar was the front part of the blade, which, in addition to having a segment of strange runes engraved on it, had a round protrusion on the unsharpened side, painted gold, which was quite eye-catching.



Despite not wanting to admit her fondness, she couldn't suppress the impulse and reached out to pick it up.

"Why does it look so... strange?"

"Because this is not an ordinary weapon," Roland laughed, "Its name is Ashbringer. Compared to your previous plain greatsword, it can already be considered a legendary item."

"..." Ashes decided not to delve into the inexplicable terminology the other party used, "Since that's the case, I'll accept it. As a return gift, I will also give you a present."

"Oh? What is it?" the prince asked curiously.

She did not answer and left the room directly.

...

The next morning, as Roland pushed open the door, he saw Nightingale sitting at the office desk with a piece of dried fish in her mouth.

"They've left."



"Both of them left?"



"Yes," she answered lazily, "they hit the road as soon as the day broke, and Wendy even went to see her off for a bit."



Roland couldn't help feeling a bit emotional. Wendy cared for every sister, not to mention this witch who had once protected her from harm and indirectly helped her escape from the monastery. He had thought that Wendy would follow Ashes and leave, but he did not expect her to be the first to decline the invitation.



In the end, the Witch Union still had twelve members, which filled Roland with vigor.



"Do you think they will really tell the witches across the sea about this place?"



"Maybe they will, maybe they won't," he leaned back in his chair and let out a long sigh, "But when they encounter insurmountable difficulties, they will always remember Border Town."



Closing his eyes, Roland reviewed the memories that belonged to the Fourth Prince in his mind.



Tilly did not get very close to him, or rather, she kept a certain distance from everyone, even King Wimbledon III was no exception. Apart from her beautiful appearance and the exceptional intelligence she had shown from a young age, there was not much information about her in his mind.



Roland had no idea when the Fifth Princess started secretly protecting witches or when she planned to head to the Fjords to expand. However, no matter what, she could be considered a potential natural ally—after all, opposing the Church was a common goal for both of them at the moment.



As for dispatching Theo to spread rumors, it was not in vain either. The awakening of witches is a random event, and Tilly cannot possibly take away all the witches, especially after the organization's evacuation. Newly awakened witches will be even more eager to find a place where they can settle down.

Now that he was aware of the intelligence on the God's Punishment Army, the next thing he had to do was undoubtedly to expand the production scale of double acid.

More efficient gunpowder and explosives cannot do without nitric acid and sulfuric acid. After the First Army switched to revolvers, the rifled barrels paired with fixed ammunition would greatly improve shooting accuracy. Therefore, training became particularly important—in an era without the suppression of barrage fire, a veteran marksman was worth ten new recruits who fired their guns wildly. By then, the number of bullets consumed would be a staggering figure.

Moreover, black powder would leave residue in the barrel, clogging the rifling and reducing the lifespan of the gun barrel. Only by using smokeless powder could this problem be solved. The early smokeless powder was actually nitrocellulose, and later it became a mixture of nitroglycerin and nitrocellulose. At present, the nitric acid used merely for soaking the priming fulminate cotton was already insufficient, let alone switching the entire propellant to guncotton.

Laboratory methods could only produce on a small scale; to meet the needs of an army, industrialized production methods were necessary. Unfortunately, faced with the completely unfamiliar chemical industry, Roland could not think of a good solution for the time being.

Besides, education could not be neglected either. Not only was it necessary to popularize basic cultural knowledge, but ideological transformation also needed to be implemented as soon as possible. The indigenous people had been tested by the Evil Months and, with the propaganda from the First Army, they had a relatively high degree of recognition of the witch community. However, newcomers still held the concepts instilled by the Church. Now, the population of outsiders in Border Town had increased sharply, especially the serfs—they were currently living in wooden shacks by the Redwater River, which could be regarded as the 'outer district' of the town. But once they were promoted to freemen, they would inevitably move into the city gradually. By that time, it would be too late to correct their notions.

He must come up with a method of transformation that was imperceptible and yet easy for the masses to accept.

...

As he indulged in these random thoughts for a while, he opened his eyes and suddenly found Nightingale watching him from the side. The moment their eyes met, she subconsciously turned her head away.



"Ah...right, I forgot to tell you something," the witch looked out of the window, feigning nonchalance, "Wendy asked me to pass on a message to you."

"What?" Roland asked.

"She said, 'Thank you.'"
