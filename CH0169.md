## Farewell
In the office, she saw Roland Wimbledon again, who was engrossed in writing something, probably dealing with government affairs. The sun had already set, painting the sky with a touch of gold. The afterglow passed through the floor-to-ceiling windows, casting a long shadow on the desk.

Only when the prince put down his quill did Ashes speak, "I won."

"Indeed, you won," he nodded succinctly.

His straightforward attitude surprised her slightly. She had thought that Roland might argue, but he acknowledged the outcome.

"But I admit you have the ability to fight against the God's Punishment Army," she said. "The God's Punishment Army is not immune to weapons; their strength and bodies are similar to mine, but they lack consciousness and the ability to think—that's why I could handle three at the same time. If it had been a knight facing the God's Punishment Army as per our earlier contest, I think they would only charge head-on. So the God's Punishment Army cannot be sent out alone like the Judgement Army. If I'm not mistaken, the Church needs to dispatch someone to lead them in battle."

"Thank you," Roland smiled. "This information is very important."

"What is the new weapon in the knight's hands?"

"A repeater rifle," he said. "From now on, all my soldiers will use this weapon. Even a farmer without a weapon can defeat a well-trained Judgement Army soldier with a rifle."

Ashes hesitated, "Can you give me a rifle?"



"Unless you join the Witch Union," Roland spread his hands, "after all, such things are still very rare."



Her refusal was expected. She exhaled, "I must meet with Tilly as soon as possible, I will leave Border Town early tomorrow morning. If you can't hold on, you can move to the Fjords for refuge."



He nodded, "You too, don't forget to tell my dear sister that there is still a place for witches in the Western Region of Greycastle."



"..." Ashes was silent for a moment, "I will consider it."



Just as she was about to leave the office, the prince called to her, "Wait, I have a gift for you, it's right behind the door."



A gift?



She was taken aback, turned around, and saw a huge longsword placed by the door—obscured by the door, she hadn't noticed it when she entered.



"Your longsword is no longer usable, so I had Anna forge a new one for you. This is not a low-quality iron sword, but one made of pure steel."



Indeed, it had a uniform and smooth surface, reflecting an orange-red metallic luster in the setting sun. She approached and gently touched the greatsword, noticing the even thickness of the blade and the signs of quenching on one edge—without a doubt, it was a weapon of excellent quality. The only thing that puzzled Ashes was its design; unlike the double-edged standard swords, it had a single edge, with the other side about as wide as a little finger, lacking a point, and the head was trapezoidal. Most peculiar was the front part of the blade, which, in addition to having a strange runic inscription, had a round protrusion on the unsharpened side that was painted gold, very eye-catching.



Despite not wanting to admit her fondness, she couldn't help but feel impelled to reach out and pick it up.

"Why does it look so... strange?"

"Because this is not an ordinary weapon," Roland said with a smile, "Its name is Ashbringer. Compared to your previous Whiteboard Greatsword, it can be considered a legendary item."

"..." Ashes decided not to delve into the strange terminology the other party used, "In that case, I accept it. As a reciprocal gesture, I will also give you a gift."

"Oh? What is it?" the prince asked curiously.

She did not answer but left the room straight away.

...

The next morning, as Roland opened the door, he saw Nightingale sitting at the desk with a piece of dried fish in her mouth.

"They've left."



"Both of them have left?"

"Yeah," she answered lazily, "they set off at dawn, and Wendy even went to see her off for a bit."

Roland couldn't help feeling touched; Wendy cared for every sister, especially for the witch who had saved her from harm and indirectly helped her escape the monastery. He had thought that Wendy would leave with Ashes, but to his surprise, she was the first to reject the invitation.

In the end, the Witch Union still numbered twelve, filling Roland with vigor.

"Do you think they will really share the news about this place with the witches across the sea?"

"Maybe, maybe not," he leaned back in his chair, taking a long breath, "but when they encounter insurmountable difficulties, they will always remember Border Town."

Closing his eyes, Roland flipped through the memories belonging to the Fourth Prince in his mind.

Tilly didn't get very close to him, or rather, she kept a certain distance from everyone, not excluding Wimbledon III. Apart from her exquisite beauty and the exceptional intelligence she had displayed since childhood, his mind didn't retain much information about her.

Roland had no idea when the Fifth Princess began to secretly shelter witches, or when she planned to head to the Fjords to develop. However, no matter what, she could be considered a potential natural ally—after all, opposing the Church was a common goal they shared for the time being.



As for sending out Tassa to spread rumors, it wasn't in vain either. The awakening of witches is a random event; Tilly couldn't possibly take all the witches with her, especially after the organization evacuates, the newly awakened witches would seek a place of refuge more eagerly.



Now that he had information on the God's Punishment Army, the next thing he needed to do was undoubtedly to expand the production scale of double acid.

More efficient gunpowder and explosives couldn't do without nitric acid and sulfuric acid. After the First Army switched to revolvers, rifled barrels paired with fixed ammunition would greatly improve shooting accuracy, making training especially important—in an era without barrage suppression, a veteran marksman was worth ten new recruits who fired recklessly. By then, the ammunition consumption would surely be an astonishing figure.



Moreover, black powder would leave residues in the barrel, clogging the rifling and reducing the barrel's service life. Only by using smokeless powder could this problem be solved. The early smokeless powders were actually nitrocellulose, and later, a mixture of nitroglycerin and nitrocellulose. Now, even the nitric acid used for soaking the primer cotton was barely sufficient, let alone switching all the propellants to guncotton.



Laboratory methods could only produce on a small scale. To meet the needs of an army, industrial production methods were necessary. Unfortunately, faced with the completely unfamiliar chemical industry, Roland couldn't think of a good solution for the time being.



Besides, education couldn't be neglected either. Not only was it necessary to promote elementary cultural knowledge, but ideological transformation also needed to be implemented as soon as possible. The natives had been tested by the Evil Months and, with the propaganda of the First Army, had a higher acceptance of the witch community. However, newcomers still held on to the concepts instilled by the Church. Now, with the influx of outsiders to Border Town, especially the serfs—currently living in wooden huts by the Redwater River, which could be considered the 'outer district' of the town—once they were promoted to free citizens, they would inevitably move into the town. By then, it would be too late to correct their views.



He had to think of a subtle way of transformation that would be easily accepted by the general populace.

...

Lost in such thoughts for a while, he opened his eyes and suddenly realized that Nightingale was watching him. In the moment their eyes met, she unconsciously turned her head away.



"Ah...right, I forgot to mention something to you," the witch looked out the window, feigning nonchalance, "Wendy asked me to pass on a message to you."

"What?" Roland asked.

"She said, 'Thank you.'"
