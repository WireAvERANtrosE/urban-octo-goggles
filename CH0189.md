## Stars and Flowers
There was no curtain, no opening speech, just a wooden board separating the stage from the backstage area. A group of people were performing a play on such a rudimentary stage for the first time in their lives, and it was also their first formal performance.

"The story takes place in the capital of a kingdom, in the outer city district, there lived a beautiful and kind girl..."

As the narration began, Irene slowly walked to the center of the stage. She was dressed in a dirty grey robe, her hair messily coiled atop her head, her face smeared with black soot.

Swinging the broom in her hands, she carefully swept the floor, occasionally bending down to wipe away stubborn dirt with the corner of her robe.

After several days of rehearsal, Irene had memorized the entire plot. The story was simple: a commoner girl who lost her mother suffered bullying at home, but her kindness led her to save a witch. In return, the witch used her magic to send her to the ball hosted by the prince, where she and the prince fell in love at first sight. Unfortunately, the magic had a time limit, and she had to hastily leave the ball, leaving behind a glass slipper in her rush. The prince, determined to find the beautiful girl, spared no effort in searching the entire city, and finally found her in the outskirts of the city, leading to their happy life together.

The story was easy to understand, and the plot deviated from the usual tales of princesses and princes in love, focusing instead on a commoner girl who won the prince's favor through her kindness and with the help of a witch. As the protagonist Cinderella, the transition from enduring bullying to mustering the courage to resist was a key aspect that the actress needed to portray.

But what Irene never expected was that May would actually give up the leading role to her.

She was already thrilled that the Star of the Western Region was willing to perform on the same stage with her, and as a mainstay of the Stronghold Theater, May had enough pride and confidence to play the lead in any play. However, in "Cinderella," she actively requested to play the role of Cinderella's half-sister, born of the same father.

Irene found this hard to believe, until the other party emphasized repeatedly that this performance was meant for newcomers, and then Irene accepted the role of Cinderella.



During the subsequent rehearsals, she put in all her effort, not only practicing each scene repeatedly but also pestering May, who shared her bed, to teach her acting skills after the candles had been extinguished, all just so she wouldn't let down the good intentions of the other.

Fortunately, Irene was not without experience. Looking into the eyes of the countless people in the audience, she relaxed her body, and reproduced the content she had practiced over and over again. Up to this point, she felt that she was in good condition and hadn't made any mistakes. When Rosia, who played the witch, became nervous and forgot her lines, Irene encouraged her with her eyes.

"I'll share half of my porridge with you, but don't eat too quickly, it's still very hot."

"Thank you for your kindness, little girl, I will repay you."

As Rosia hunched her back and walked backstage, the crowd began to applaud—this made Irene breathe a sigh of relief. She knew that if this had happened during a formal performance at the stronghold theater, forgetting one's lines was an unforgivable mistake. The nobles would only mock the actor with boos, rather than respond with kind applause.

It was at this moment that May entered the scene.

This part of the story was the first conflict between the mean stepsister and Cinderella, where the former bullied and insulted the latter, who could only respond with tears and hide in the basement to silently cry over her mother's portrait.

But when the other stood before her, Irene suddenly realized that the atmosphere on stage had dramatically changed.

She was no longer the quiet star of the theater during rehearsals but had become the ruler of the stage. Her elevated demeanor, her perfectly measured movements, the undisguised contempt in her eyes, all of it made Irene feel an intense sense of oppression.



"Hey, look who it is? Not working in broad daylight, what are you daydreaming about?"

"You unwanted wretch, hurry up and clean my gown!"

"Don't be so clumsy anymore, this is a dress for an official banquet, you can't afford to damage it in the slightest."

May pushed her hard, and although Irene was supposed to pretend to fall at this moment, under the cold gaze of the other, she couldn't help but take a few steps back, accidentally tripping over herself and falling to the ground without any cushioning, her elbow hitting the stage floor, sending a sharp pain through her.

"What a useless piece of trash..." May's eyes no longer lingered on her but walked to the center of the stage, facing the silent square and crowd, beginning her monologue.



"Miss May is truly impressive," Margie whispered in admiration, "With just a few sentences, she has captured everyone's attention. She has completely brought the character to life."

"Hmm, indeed impressive." Roland nodded, but isn't this person a little too impressive? The disgust and contempt she showed for Irene felt so real, that even sitting here, one could feel her ruthless coldness. The emotional contagion was evident from the expressions of the audience... But, she's not the protagonist. Irene's performance, which was quite good on its own, seemed pale in comparison to hers. At this rate, it seemed the supporting role would overshadow the protagonist.

Irene was somewhat dazed.

She knew she needed to stand up quickly. May's monologue was mainly to express her longing for the prince and to lead into the court ball, it wouldn't last too long, and she had to leave the stage before the scene changed. But the familiar feeling from the rehearsals had left her, and for the first time, Irene found the stage so alien.



Is that all you can do?



It wasn't until May finished her performance and walked past her, the fluttering hem of her dress slapping against her face, that Irene snapped back to reality. May hadn't said a word, but Irene read that sentence from the cold gaze of the Star of the Western Region. Irene knew that May couldn't possibly lift her up; their roles were as incompatible as fire and water. If she reached out, the play would be ruined. Biting her lips tightly, the taste of iron seeped from between them as she watched May's retreating figure disappear behind the partition. She wanted to get up and follow her offstage, but Gatro and Sam had already come running up with the props, and Sam even took the opportunity to whisper in front of her while arranging the barrels, "The next scene is still yours, keep acting, you can do it!"



Irene knew it was against the rules, but she had indeed... missed her chance to exit the stage.



Thus, the audience witnessed a marvelous transformation: Cinderella sat motionless in the center of the stage, while the scenes around her changed from a living room to a basement. The beautiful round table and wooden chairs were exchanged for barrels and wicker baskets. The prop movers bustled back and forth, but the girl maintained her pose, as if frozen in time.



The following plot involved Cinderella being trapped in the basement, while a witch appeared to rescue her. The witch not only gave her beautiful clothes but also summoned a carriage that could take her directly to the palace.



"Remember, the spell only lasts until midnight. You must leave the palace before the dragon clock chimes. Otherwise, both the clothes and the carriage will disappear."



"Ah... yes, I understand. Thank you."



At this moment, Irene was still not fully recovered from her daze. Previously, when she had hidden backstage to secretly watch May's performance, she thought this woman, who could freely express herself and bloom with a smile in front of over a thousand spectators, was incredibly impressive. But only when she stood on stage, facing this dazzling star, did she fully understand the astonishing talent May possessed in the performing arts.



Is this the distance between a star and a flower?



After delivering her lines with a dry tone, the next scene was the first climax of the play: the royal ball. To achieve the effect of a grand ball, this scene required the full cast to appear—aside from her and May, Carter, Sam, Lorgar, and Tilly would all don masks and dress as other noble dancers. And the one playing the prince was none other than her lover, Philip Hilt.
