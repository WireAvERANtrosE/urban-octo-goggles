## Stars and Flowers
There was no curtain, no opening speech, just a wooden board separating the front of the stage from the backstage area. A group of people were performing a play for the first time on such a rudimentary stage, and it was also their first formal performance in life.

"The story takes place in the capital of a kingdom, in the outer city district, there lived a beautiful and kind girl..."

As the narration began, Irene slowly walked to the center of the stage. She was dressed in a dirty, gray robe, her hair messily bundled atop her head, her face smeared with black ash.

Swinging the broom in her hand, she carefully swept the floor, occasionally bending down to wipe away stubborn stains with the corner of her robe.

After several days of rehearsal, Irene had memorized the entire flow of the play. The story was simple: a commoner girl who had lost her mother suffered bullying at home but ended up saving a witch out of kindness. In return, the witch used her magic to send her to the ball held by the prince, where she fell in love with him at first sight. However, the magic was time-limited, and she had to leave the ball in a hurry, accidentally leaving behind a glass slipper. The prince, eager to find this beautiful girl, searched the entire city and finally found her in the outer city district. Afterwards, they lived happily ever after.

The story was straightforward and easy to understand, and the plot shifted from the usual tales of princesses and princes in love to that of a common girl who, with her kind nature, won the prince's favor with the help of a witch. As the main character, Cinderella, it was important for the actress to convey the transition from enduring oppression to mustering the courage to fight back.

But what Irene never expected was that May would give up the role of the protagonist to her.

She was already overjoyed to be performing on the same stage as the Star of the Western Region, and as the leading figure of the Fortress Theater, May had enough pride and confidence to play the main character in any play. However, in "Cinderella," she actively requested to play the stepsister of Cinderella, who had the same father but a different mother.

This was somewhat unbelievable to Irene until the other party emphasized repeatedly that this was a performance for newcomers, and only then did Irene accept the role of Cinderella.



During the following rehearsals, she put in a lot of effort, not only practicing each scene repeatedly but also pestering her bedmate May to teach her acting skills after the candles were extinguished, all for the sake of not letting down the other's kindness.



Fortunately, Irene was not without experience. Facing the countless eyes of the audience, she relaxed her body and recreated the content she had practiced over and over again. So far, she felt that she was in a good state and had not made any mistakes. When Rosia, who was playing the witch, nervously forgot her lines, Irene encouraged her with her eyes.



"I'll share half of my barley porridge with you, but don't eat too quickly, it's still hot."



"Thank you for your kindness, young lady, I will repay you."



As Rosia hobbled backstage, the audience burst into applause — which made Irene breathe a sigh of relief. She knew that forgetting lines during an official performance at the fortress theater was an unforgivable mistake; the nobles would mock the actor with jeers rather than kind applause.



It was at this moment that May made her entrance.



This scene was the first conflict between the mean sister and Cinderella, where the former bullied and insulted the latter, who could only respond with tears and hide in the basement to cry silently to her mother's portrait.



But when the other stood in front of her, Irene suddenly realized that the atmosphere on stage had completely changed.



She was no longer the reticent star of the theater during rehearsals but had become the ruler of the stage. Her elevated demeanor, her perfectly timed body movements, and the undisguised contempt in her eyes all imposed a strong pressure on Irene.



"Hey, look who it is? Not working in broad daylight, what are you daydreaming about?"

"You unwanted wretch, hurry up and clean my gown!"

"Don't be so clumsy, this is a formal banquet dress; you can't afford to damage it even a bit."

May pushed her hard, and normally Irene should pretend to fall, but under the other's cold gaze, she couldn't help but retreat a few steps and accidentally tripped over herself, falling to the ground almost without cushioning, her elbow hitting the stage floor, sending a burning pain through her.

"What a useless piece of trash..." May's eyes no longer on her, walked to the center of the stage, facing the silent square and crowd, beginning her monologue.

"Ms. May is truly admirable," Margaret said in a low voice, full of admiration, "With just a few sentences, she has captured everyone's attention; she has completely brought the character to life."

"Hmm, indeed impressive," Roland nodded, but isn't this person a bit too impressive? The disgust and contempt she showed for Irene seemed so real that even sitting here, one could feel her ruthless coldness. The emotional contagion was evident from the faces of the audience... But she isn't the protagonist. Irene's originally decent performance paled in front of her, and at this rate, I'm afraid the supporting role will overshadow the protagonist.

Irene was somewhat dazed.

She knew she had to stand up quickly; May's monologue was mainly to express her longing for the prince and to lead into the court dance, which wouldn't last long, and she had to leave the stage before the scene changed. But the familiar feeling from the rehearsals had left her, and for the first time, Irene found the stage to be so foreign.



"Is this the best you can do?"



It wasn't until May finished her performance and walked past her, her fluttering skirt slapping against her face, that Irene snapped back to reality. May didn't say a word, but Irene read the sentence from the cold eyes of the Star of the Western Region. Irene knew that May could never pull her up; their roles were like fire and water, incompatible. Once she reached out her hand, the drama would be ruined. Biting her lip hard, the taste of iron seeped from between them, watching May's retreating figure disappear behind the partition, she wanted to get up and follow her off stage, but Gatro and Sam were already running up with the props, Sam even took the opportunity to place a barrel near her and whispered, "The next act is still yours, keep going, you can do it!"



Irene knew this was against the rules, but indeed... she had already missed the chance to exit the stage.



So the audience witnessed a strange transformation. Cinderella remained motionless in the center of the stage, while the scenery around her changed from a living room to a basement. The beautiful round table and wooden chairs turned into wine barrels and wicker baskets, with props being moved back and forth, yet the girl maintained her position, as if frozen in time.



The next scene was Cinderella trapped in the basement, and the witch appearing to rescue her, not only giving her beautiful clothes but also summoning a carriage that could take her directly to the palace.



"Remember, the spell only lasts until midnight. You must leave the palace before the dragon clock strikes, or the clothes and carriage will disappear."



"Ah... Yes. I understand, thank you."



Irene was still not completely out of her daze at this moment. Previously hiding backstage and secretly watching May perform, she only felt that this woman, who smiled with ease in front of more than a thousand viewers, was very impressive. But it was only when she stood on the stage herself, facing this dazzling star, that she fully understood the astonishing talent of the other in the performing arts.



Is this the distance between a star and a flower?



After her dry exchange of lines with Rosia, the first climax of the play followed: the royal ball. To achieve the grand effect of the ball, this scene required the presence of the entire cast—aside from her and May, Gait, Sam, Rosia, and Tilly would all don masks and dress up as other noble dancers. And the one portraying the prince was none other than her lover, Phyllis Hilt.
