## In the Garden
Scroll stood silently behind Prince Roland, watching as he drafted documents. The autumn sunlight poured in from the outside window, bathing her in warmth.



"Ah, besides the gains and losses of electricity, what else is there... I'm waiting online, it's quite urgent." The prince would occasionally scribble something on the paper, then start to massage his forehead in deep thought, uttering some incomprehensible nonsense. At first, Scroll was worried about his health, but later she realized that this was just how the prince normally recalled "knowledge."



Today, however, his condition seemed more severe than usual.



It's a pity I can't help him... Scroll sighed softly. Among the witches, probably only Anna could assist him in this regard. She had committed to memory all the pages the prince had written earlier—though that was all she had done. This knowledge was much more complex than the mathematics and natural principles she had learned before. Just reading it once could make one's head spin, no wonder the prince was having such a hard time.



"How about we call it a day?" Scroll couldn't help but suggest.



Roland, as if in resignation, tossed the pen aside and leaned back in his chair, exhaling deeply. "I truly envy your photographic memory. If I had a memory like yours, I wouldn't be afraid of exams. I would have been admitted to a prestigious school and reached the pinnacle of life."



She automatically ignored the latter part of his nonsense. "Does the prince also need to take exams in the palace?"



"Yes, how else to determine which prince is more outstanding?" he muttered.



"Sometimes, it's not always good to remember everything," Scroll said with a smile. "For instance, it's happier to forget bad experiences, sadness, and distress."



Back in Seawindshire, due to her status as a commoner, she endured countless insults and beatings. Even now, she could clearly remember the parts of her body that were hit, the twisted faces of her abusers as they vented their anger, and the pain that each punch and kick brought. It was not until she was protected by the old captain with a broken leg that her life began to improve slightly. In fact, in places like the slums, people died every day from internal strife and fights, not any less than those who died from freezing or starving to death.



For a long time, she despised herself for remembering all the suffering so vividly. The scenes in her memory were too clear, and almost every night she would relive the unbearable past in her nightmares. It was only after she came of age and awakened her branch ability, "Magic Book," that she realized her extraordinary memory was a gift that came with being a witch.



Roland probably guessed what she was thinking and showed an apologetic smile, "You're right."



Scroll felt a warm flow in her heart.



It was rare for anyone to care about the thoughts of a witch, let alone someone of noble status.



"It's okay, those days are behind us, Your Highness."



Roland Wimbledon was different from any noble... no, he was different from any person she had ever met. He possessed extensive knowledge, yet spent his days wanting to share it with others; he was of noble birth, yet he did not have an exclusionary attitude; he enjoyed the adoration of many and could act recklessly, but not only did he refrain from doing so, he also took care of other people's feelings.



A remote and impoverished town had undergone earth-shattering changes in just one year, and the witches had finally received the peace and freedom they had longed for, all thanks to His Highness Roland. If she hadn't experienced it herself, she would never have believed that such a ruler could exist in the world.



Now, Scroll found that her own thoughts were gradually changing. Before, she did not agree with His Highness marrying a witch, but at this moment, she felt that His Highness would ascend the throne of Greycastle no matter whom he married—he relied not on those traditionalists who were greedy for power and profit, but on the people who supported him to bring them a better life.



She vaguely felt that this power would be stronger than any force before it.

"Ah, never mind," Roland suddenly rubbed his head, "This is the last page of content."

"Will you continue recording tomorrow?"

"No, just hand it over to him like this, and include a physics textbook as well; that should be enough to keep him occupied for a while." His Highness pulled out a new piece of paper and quickly wrote a few bold characters, "After all, it's a book from the 'Ancient Era,' it's quite normal for it to be missing a large part, right?"

Scroll took the piece of paper and saw the name of the book written on it—《Intermediate Chemistry (Incomplete)》.

...

After completing her memory work, she left the office, preparing to head to the City Hall, when the splendid scenery of the backyard garden caught her attention.

With the completion of the expansion of the castle walls, the backyard was now almost the size of a small town square. In less than a week's time, it had been filled with all sorts of plants. There was no doubt that this was Leaf's masterpiece.

Scroll walked along the pathway framed by olive trees, step by step towards the depths of the garden. After passing a dense field of sugarcane, she saw Leaf sitting by a small pond, resting.



The other party did not tie her usual braids, but instead let her emerald green long hair drape casually over her shoulders. Her white feet gently patted the water, holding broken wheat grains in her hand and occasionally tossing them to the schools of fish swimming around. Whenever a fish came up to nuzzle her toes, Leaf would let out an involuntary chuckle.



"Are your feet better?" Scroll sat down beside her.



"Ah, Teacher Scroll," she blinked, then nodded with a smile, "Yes, Miss Nana has restored them back to their original state. Now I won't have to endure the pain in my toes during winter."



"Is everything planted here in the garden improved by you?"



"Mhm," Leaf pointed happily, "Over there is the grape arbor, and here are the fruit trees and crops. I also asked His Highness to bring in a batch of compost, which is perfect for testing the absorption effects of the new crops. Additionally, the fruit tree area is equipped with dozens of bird nests, and the flying messengers raised by Honey are all sleeping on the trees."



Scroll affectionately stroked her long hair, "I originally thought you would be the first witch in the Witch Union to evolve, especially since the abilities you displayed in the Impassable Mountain Range were already no less than Cara's."



"His Highness says evolution stems from understanding one's own abilities, and plant cells indeed seem miraculous. But I felt very early on that they should be part of a whole. Look, a bundle of grass can come together to form flexible vines. If they were all different, how could they merge together?"



Scroll opened her mouth, unsure whether to comfort her or to agree with her words. In the end, she simply said, "Even without evolving, your abilities can still do a lot for His Highness."



"I feel that it is not far from me," Leaf shook her head, her eyes sparkling brightly, "Animals are life, plants are life, and even the parts that make them up are life... Birds need trees to build nests, and their droppings can nourish the trees. A forest can provide for everything needed, and at the same time, it expands with the nourishment of everything." She paused, "Looking at this garden, I feel that I have found the direction to move forward."
