## In the garden
Scroll stood behind Prince Roland, quietly observing him as he drafted documents. The autumn sunlight streamed in from the window behind, enveloping her in a cocoon of warmth.



"Ah, apart from the gains and losses of electricity, what else is there... I'm waiting online, it's quite urgent." The prince would occasionally jot down a few words, then start rubbing his forehead in thought, occasionally uttering some incomprehensible nonsense. At first, Scroll was somewhat concerned about his physical condition, but she later realized that this was just his normal state when recalling "knowledge."



It's just that today's symptoms seemed more severe than usual.



It's a pity she couldn't help him... Scroll sighed softly. Among the witches, probably only Anna could assist him in this regard. She had committed to memory all the content the prince had written earlier—though it was just memorization. This knowledge was much more profound than the mathematics and natural principles she had learned before. Just reading it once could make one's head spin; no wonder the prince was having such a hard time.



"Perhaps we should call it a day?" Scroll could not help but say.



Roland, as if giving up, dropped his pen and leaned back in his chair with a sigh, "I truly envy your eidetic memory. If I had your ability, I wouldn't fear exams. I would have been admitted to a prestigious school and reached the pinnacle of life by now."



She automatically ignored the latter half of his nonsense, "Does the prince also need to take exams in the palace?"



"Yes, otherwise how would we determine which prince is more outstanding," he muttered.



"Sometimes, it's not always good to remember everything," Scroll said with a smile, "For example, unpleasant experiences, sadness, and sorrow are better forgotten for happiness."



Back in Seawindshire, due to her identity as a poor commoner, she had endured countless humiliations and beatings. Even now, she vividly remembered the places where she was hit, the twisted faces of her assailants as they vented their anger, and the pain each punch and kick brought. It was not until she was taken under the protection of the old captain with a broken leg that her life began to improve slightly. In fact, in places like the slums, there were people dying every day from internal strife and fights, no fewer in number than those who died from freezing or starvation.



For a long time, she had loathed herself for why all the suffering was so etched in her mind. Because the scenes in her memory were so clear, almost every nightmare in the middle of the night was a repetition of that unbearable past. It wasn't until the day she came of age that she awakened her branch ability, "Magic Book," and understood that her memory far exceeded that of ordinary people was due to her identity as a witch.



Roland probably guessed what she was thinking and showed an apologetic smile, "You're right."



Scroll suddenly felt a warm current flow through her heart.



Very few people cared about the thoughts of witches, let alone someone who was a noble of the royal family.



"It's alright, those days are past, Your Highness."



Roland Wimbledon was unlike any noble... no, he was unlike any person she had ever seen. He was knowledgeable, yet thought about teaching others every day; he was of high birth, yet did not have an attitude of rejection; he was adored by everyone, and could act recklessly if he wished, but he did not do so. Instead, he took care of the feelings of others.



A remote and poor town underwent earth-shaking changes within a year, and the witches also received the long-desired peace and freedom. All of this was thanks to His Highness Roland. If she hadn't experienced it herself, she would never have believed that there could be such a ruler in the world.



Now, Scroll found that her own thoughts were also gradually changing. Before, she did not agree with His Highness marrying a witch, but now she felt that no matter whom His Highness married, he would ascend to the throne of Greycastle—he relied not on those traditionalist nobles who coveted power and profit but on the people who supported him for bringing them a better life.



She faintly felt that this power would be stronger than any force before it.

"Ah, forget it," Roland suddenly rubbed his head, "this is the last page of content."

"Will you record more tomorrow?"

"No, just hand it over to him like this, and include a physics textbook as well, that should be enough for him to study for a while." His Highness pulled out a new piece of paper and quickly wrote down a few large characters, "After all, it's a book from the 'Ancient Era', it's quite normal for it to be missing a large part, right?"

Scroll took the paper, and saw the name of the book written on it—《Intermediate Chemistry (Incomplete)》.

...

After completing her memory work, she left the office, preparing to head to the City Hall, when the gorgeous view of the backyard garden caught her attention.

With the completion of the castle walls' expansion, the backyard was now almost the size of a town square. In less than a week, it had been filled with all kinds of plants. Without a doubt, this must have been Leaf's masterpiece.

Scroll walked down the path made by the olive trees, step by step towards the depths of the garden, passing by a row of dense sugarcane fields, where she saw Leaf resting by the side of a small pond.



The other party didn't have her usual braids, instead letting her emerald long hair drape casually over her shoulders. Her pure white feet gently splashed in the water, and she held broken wheat grains in her hands, occasionally tossing them to the swimming fish. Whenever a fish brushed against her toes, Leaf couldn't help but let out a light laugh.



"Are your feet better?" Scroll sat down beside her.



"Ah, Teacher Scroll," she blinked and then nodded with a smile, "Yes, Miss Nana has restored them to their original state. This way, I won't have to endure the pain in my toes during winter."



"Are all the plants in the garden ones you've improved?"



"Mhm," Leaf pointed happily, "Over there is the grape trellis, and this side is the fruit trees and crops. I also asked His Highness to bring over a batch of compost, just right to test the absorption effects of the new crops. Also in the fruit tree area, there are dozens of bird nests. The flying messengers raised by Honey are all sleeping up in the trees."



Scroll affectionately stroked her long hair, "I originally thought you would be the first witch in the Witch Union to evolve, given that the power you demonstrated in the Impassable Mountain Range was already no less than Cara's."



"His Highness said evolution comes from understanding one's own abilities. Plant cells are indeed miraculous, but I've felt for a long time that they should be a whole. Look, a bundle of small grasses condensing together can transform into flexible vines. If they were all different, how could they merge together?"



Scroll opened her mouth, not sure whether to comfort her or to agree with her words, but in the end, she could only say, "Even without evolving, your abilities can do a lot for His Highness."



"I feel that it's not far from me," Leaf shook her head, her eyes sparkling brightly, "Animals are life, plants are also life, and even the parts that make them up are life... Birds need trees to build their nests, and their droppings can nourish the trees. A forest can provide for everything, and it will also expand under the nurturing of all things." She paused, "Looking at this garden, I feel that I've found the direction to move forward."
