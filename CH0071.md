## Spy (Part 2)
Apart from the light of the fireplace, a mahogany lamp stand was placed beside Barov's desk. The top of the stand branched into four arms, with the central arm being the tallest and the other three arranged in a triangular shape around it. Each arm held a burning candle, their quietly blossoming points of light like a dazzling mountain peak.



The room was filled with the fragrance of pine resin, like the sweet yet damp scent of rotting wood, which made one feel drowsy. But in Border Town, one couldn't ask for much more. Refinement and elegance were irrelevant in this land of poverty, and having a house to shelter from the wind and rain was already quite good, let alone a whole bunch of houses.



His office was located in a large courtyard not far from the castle, which was also the site of the former lord's city hall. Of course, when the lord left, he took all his staff with him, and this place had now become the domain of the minister's aides.



The rustling sound of writing inside the room and the whistling cold wind outside the window made up two different worlds. In front of a wooden desk piled with books and ancient scrolls, Barov was writing vigorously. On each side of him, there was a low log table, usually unoccupied and only used for placing manuscripts. When needed, he would summon his disciples to lean over these low tables to help organize materials or draft documents.



The candles on the lamp stand had been changed three times. Aside from getting up to replace them, Barov had not stopped his rapid writing for a moment. Time was extremely precious to him. There was still a stack of documents waiting for his attention, and the financial expenditures proposed by His Highness needed careful review.



Now Barov worked an average of five hours a day, but he did not feel tired at all; on the contrary, here he could exercise his full power, feeling an endless energy within him. This was the taste of authority, he thought. No longer having to timidly follow behind his mentor, all the apprentices obeyed him, and no one dared to drag their feet or trip him up. As long as he carried out the prince's orders, he could control the specifics of governance by himself.



If only the prince's commands were a bit more normal, Barov thought with a slight hint of regret as he smacked his lips. For instance, the document before him, bearing Prince Roland's personal seal, requested the dispatch of personnel to Willow Town to recruit managers, as well as the purchase of a schooner. The second request even had a special note added: Considering the price, it was not necessary to include a captain, helmsman, or sailors.



After reading it, he didn't know whether to laugh or cry. Without these people, who would sail the ship back? After buying it, were they supposed to walk back? And what was the purpose of buying a ship in the first place? That was the most crucial point. Trade between Border Town and Willow Town was very stable, and if they wanted to expand ore trade after winter, they simply had to inform the other side to increase the number of ships. Buying their own ship was not cost-effective, especially since the town's dock could only be used for mooring, with no shipyard for maintenance or sailors to take care of it. It wouldn't be long before it was abandoned. Perhaps it was another burst of His Highness's whimsical ideas?



As for the first request, he could understand that.



The City Hall was currently swamped from top to bottom, with Barov leading over ten individuals responsible for supervising commerce, compiling statistical reports, and handling income and expenditure settlements. He had taken on the administrative and legal work himselfâ€”clearly, this was not reasonable. His Highness wanted to separate these departments, which would necessitate expanding the staffing of the City Hall. It was a perfectly normal rationale, yet the assistant minister was reluctant to relinquish control so soon. The satisfaction of having all the power in one's hands was too fulfilling; he thought that even his own teacher, the Kingdom's Minister of Finance, was only responsible for Greycastle's purse strings, while he was the hand of the king.



Cough, well, only effective in Border Town, he added to himself. Although Prince Roland had promised as much, there was still a long road ahead to ascend to the throne. Barov found himself, unknowingly, once again considering the Fourth Prince as a contender for the crown. In the past, he would never have thought that this ill-tempered and ignorant playboy could be crowned as king.



Since arriving in Border Town, the surprises had never ceased. Up to now, Border Town still stood firm in the western border under the protection of the militia, and it seemed it could hold on for a long time, which alone was worthy of high praise. Not to mention those strange contraptions he tinkered with, even his grasp of people's hearts was completely unlike the Fourth Prince of Greycastle times, but more like a devil who sees through everything.



At that moment, there was a knock on the door. Barov reluctantly ceased his work and called out, "Come in."



The one who entered was one of his proud disciples, "Penholder" Yarrow.



"Teacher, another 'rat' has been caught," he reported.



"Oh? What did he confess?" Barov inquired.



"He said he was sent by the Second Prince; we found a packet of cement powder, some coins, and a letter on him." Yarrow stepped forward and handed Barov an envelope wrapped in cowhide, "We are still interrogating for other information. Teacher, regarding his disposal..."



"The same as before, compile all the information after the interrogation is done. Then pronounce him guilty and hang him," Barov said nonchalantly.



"Yes," Yarrow bowed and said, "then the disciple will take his leave."

The door was closed again, Barov didn't immediately continue his work. Instead, he returned to his desk, used a letter opener to slice open the envelope, and took out the letter.



The fourth one... he thought to himself.



Long before the Evil Months arrived, Prince Roland Wimbledon had summoned him to discuss this issue.



His Highness believed that as the cement, the new type of snow powder, and the witches were disclosed one after another, the spies that his siblings had planted would inevitably become restless and reveal themselves. This would be the perfect opportunity to weed out the rats. Barov agreed with the first part of the prince's statement but not the second part. In his view, it was impossible to keep tabs on every single one of the more than two thousand people in Border Town. They didn't have the manpower, nor the time to guard against these petty thieves.



But the prince said indifferently, "How could there be no one? Every subject in Border Town is our pair of eyes."



At that time, Barov thought the other party was completely fanciful. To expect these ignorant and dull commoners to monitor for potential rats? That was simply impossible!



But, as it turned out, he was wrong.



During the first census after the onset of winter, Roland specifically instructed that all the original residents who had lived there for more than five years must be made aware: The plot to burn the food by Longsong Stronghold might have failed, but they had not given up and had already sent enemies to lurk among them. Most of them disguised themselves as relatives of the townsfolk or merchants who had failed to evacuate in time, always looking for opportunities to harm everyone. If anyone saw any suspicious individuals, they were to report immediately to the City Hall. Upon verification, a reward of twenty-five Silver Royals would be given.



The tactic turned out to be surprisingly effective.

Although there were some false reports at the beginning, it didn't take long before the first rat was caught in the trap.

At that time, Barov still remembered Roland saying something very awkward with pride.

What was it again? He thought for a moment, that's right... "Let the enemy be submerged in the vast ocean of people's war."

Such strange wording and syntax, the Assistant Minister shook his head and unfolded the letter in his hand.

This person known as "Mole" emphasized repeatedly in the letter that various phenomena indicated that the Fourth Prince, Roland Wimbledon, had been replaced by a devil, and Barov could even read the fear between the lines. Reflecting on His Highness the Prince's manipulation of the human heart, the Assistant Minister couldn't help but feel a sense of agreement. He took a deep breath, moved the letter over the candle flame, and soon the scroll was consumed by fire, turning to ashes.

Even so, wasn't that the devil who did not fear the God's Punishment Stones and could grant him power?
