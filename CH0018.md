## Envoy (Part 2)
Muttering to oneself is one thing, but the banquet must go on.



The atmosphere of the main course was fairly harmonious; the Fourth Prince did not mention the ores, and it was inconvenient for me to say more.



When the prince instructed the maids to bring out the dessert after dinner, Petro tentatively brought up the subject, "Your Highness, according to past practices, today should be the day for the delivery of the ore, but I haven't seen any ore at the dockyard."



Roland put down the little stick he was holding and nodded, "Unfortunately, there was a collapse in the northern slope mine a while ago, and my people have been trying to resume production for the past month. However, the rubble from the collapse has not been completely cleared, and at this rate, it's feared that the mine won't be operational until next year."



A collapse? Petro was stunned for a momentâ€”what a coincidence. But he quickly realized that there was no need for the other party to lie to him. A simple trip to the northern slope would make everything clear; telling such an obvious lie would be like slapping one's own face.



"What about the ores from the past two months?"



"Not much. According to practice, that little amount of stone can't support my people." Roland emphasized the word "practice," "Mr. Ambassador, you must remember the Demon Moon from two years ago, right?"



Of course, Petro remembered. The prolonged cold that lasted four months caused nearly twenty percent of the people in Border Town to starve to death, all because the municipal official Ferreno was insatiably greedy. There were voices of opposition among the nobility, and some even called for Ferreno to be punished afterward. But in the end, the incident was brushed aside, simply because he was the husband of the Duke's second daughter.



Now that the prince had brought up the matter, a bad feeling arose in Petro's heart.



"It's worse this time," Roland sighed, "If we proceed with the delivery in the same manner as before, we would only be able to exchange for a two-month quota of wheat. My people won't make it through the winter, sir. The old way of trade must be abolished."



Petro opened his mouth but didn't know how to refute. He was not a professional diplomat, and faced with such sufficient reasoning, he really couldn't find any faults and could only try to delay, "Your Highness, I regret to hear this. There won't be a repeat of the previous tragedy this time. I will have the six families lend a month's worth of food. Your people can slowly repay it after production resumes next year."



"I wouldn't need to slowly repay if I sold to Willow Town."



"But..."



"There are no buts," Roland interrupted, "They are willing to buy stones with gold royals and sell wheat, cheese, bread, honey... anything that can be bought with gold royals, they sell. To put it another way, Mr. Ambassador, even if you are willing to lend a month's worth of food, do you think the other five families will agree with your decision? As far as I know, Duke Ryan is not someone who easily reaches agreements."



Petro fell silent; the Fourth Prince was absolutely right. It's not only the other five families he couldn't even assure his own father. To maintain the monopoly, the trade plan must be revised, but he simply did not have the decisive power. Although called an ambassador, he was really just a mouthpiece. Perhaps the Duke never wished for anyone to make any private agreements with Border Town, whether with the previous lord or the Fourth Prince. That's why he appointed different people every year and every season, and these people were never the decision-makers of the family.



Regardless of the outcome, he had to try. With that thought, Petro laid out his final card, "Thirty percent," he held up three fingers, "The fortress will purchase ores and gemstones at a price thirty percent below market value. I believe this price should be higher than what Willow Town offers, Your Highness."



Roland spread his hands and said, "Indeed it is higher, but it's the same old problem. Can your words become a unanimous decision among the six families?"

"I will set off for Longsong Stronghold tomorrow. After reaching an agreement, I will come with a new contract."

"But my people cannot wait that long. You should know that it usually takes a lot of time for nobles to reach a consensus."

"Your Highness, cooperating with the stronghold is a better choice for you and your subjects. Willow Town is too far, and although you can avoid the demonic month there," at this point, Petro felt his throat dry, "but there are dangers... that could happen on the way."

My God, by the heavens above, what am I doing? His heart was pounding, am I threatening a prince?

"Hahahaha," unexpectedly, Roland did not fly into a rage but burst out laughing, "Mr. Ambassador, you seem to have misunderstood some things. I never had any intention of going to Willow Town."

"You mean..."

"Of course, I don't plan to go to Longsong Stronghold either," Roland said, looking at the ambassador with a playful gaze, "I'm not going anywhere."

Petro wondered if he had misheard.

Luckily, the prince did not let the awkward silence continue. He went on to explain, "This winter, I will be staying in Border Town. Border Town will become the new frontier of the Kingdom of Greycastle. Don't be so surprised, my friend, I'm not talking nonsense. Later, I can take you to see the newly built wall at the foot of the northern slope."

"A wall?"

"Yes, a stone wall that connects the northern slope and the Redwater River, twelve feet high and four feet wide. With it, we can defeat the demonic beasts in Border Town."

Petro felt his brain was not catching up. The last time the ambassador returned, he didn't mention any walls. No, at that time, the lord of Border Town was still a person from the stronghold. How could they possibly have sent the limited manpower to build this? So, did the Fourth Prince start building the walls as soon as he got here? Even so, it's only been three months, what kind of wall could be built in such a short time?

Wait... what did His Highness just say? Twelve feet high, four feet wide, and to connect the northern slope with the Redwater River? Petro estimated in his mind that such a scale of wall could not be completed in a few years, to begin with, he didn't have that many stonemasons to cut and polish the stones! The people living in Border Town were mostly laborers who could only sell their labor.

Before he could digest this information, Roland's next words shocked him just as much.

"As for the ore sales, starting next year, I am willing to lower the price to half, sir, but not all of it will be sold to Longsong Stronghold. Because you might not need that much ore. I think you would prefer some metal products, like iron shovels and iron spades, over the low-profit raw ore," he paused for a moment, seemingly waiting for Petro to grasp the implications of his words, "As for the raw gemstones, they will be sold through an auction to the highest-bidding merchant. As much as I would like to wait until the gems are cut before selling them for a good price, unfortunately, Border Town doesn't have the capability for that yet."



"Do you have the ability to build a wall in a few months!" Piro roared inwardly. And what does he mean by not needing that much ore? A mere production of a thousand Gold royals per year, even if the output increases, at most it would double, right? A fortress couldn't consume two thousand Gold royals? That's just too arrogant!



He struggled to suppress his dissatisfaction and tried his best to maintain his last bit of decorum, "I have taken note of all that you said, Your Highness. I will immediately discuss this with the six families upon my return. However, about the wall you mentioned... I would like to see it."



"Of course," Roland smiled, "But there's no need to rush. It wouldn't hurt to enjoy these capital's special pastries before you set off, right? Mr. Ambassador."
