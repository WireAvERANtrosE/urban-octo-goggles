## Envoy (Part 2)
Grumblings aside, the banquet still had to be eaten.

The atmosphere during the main course was fairly harmonious. The Fourth Prince didn't bring up the ore, so it wasn't convenient for him to say much either.

When the prince ordered the maid to bring the dessert after dinner, Peter tentatively mentioned, "Your Highness, according to past practice, today should be the day for the delivery of the ore, but I haven't seen any ore at the dockyard."

Roland put down the little wooden stick in his hand and nodded, "Unfortunately, there was a collapse in the mine on the northern slope a while ago, and my people have been trying to resume production for the past month. However, the rubble at the site of the collapse has not yet been cleared, and at this rate, it's feared that work in the mining area will have to be delayed until next year."

A collapse? Peter was stunned for a moment. Such a coincidence? But he quickly realized that the other party had no need to lie to him. Otherwise, just one trip to the northern slope would make it clear, and such an obvious lie would be like slapping one's own face.

"What about the ore from the past two months?"

"Not much, as per usual practice, such a small amount of ores cannot sustain my subjects," Roland emphasized the word "usual practice." "Mister Ambassador, you should still remember the Evil Months two years ago, right?"

Peter certainly remembered. The prolonged cold that lasted four months had caused nearly twenty percent of the people in Border Town to starve to death, and the reason was the insatiable greed of the city official, Ferreno. There were also voices of dissent among the nobility, and some even demanded that Ferreno be punished afterward. But in the end, the incident came to nothing, simply because he was the husband of the Duke's second daughter.

Now that the prince had brought it up, Peter felt a sense of foreboding.



"This time it's worse," Roland sighed. "If we proceed with the trade as before, I'm afraid we can only exchange enough wheat for two months' worth of rations. My people won't survive the winter, sir. The previous trade method must be abolished."



Peter opened his mouth, but he didn't know how to refute. He wasn't a professional diplomat, and faced with such compelling reasons, he really couldn't find any fault and could only stall for time. "Your Highness, I regret to hear this. It will not be a repeat of the previous tragedies. I will have the six families jointly lend one month's supply of food. Your subjects can repay it slowly after production is resumed next year."



"I wouldn't need to repay slowly if I sold to Willow Town."



"But..."



"There are no 'buts,'" Roland interrupted. "They are willing to use gold royals to purchase the ores, while offering wheat, cheese, bread, and honey at market price... everything that can be bought with gold royals, they sell. And even if, Mister Ambassador, you were willing to lend one month's supply of food, would the other five families agree to your decision? As far as I know, the Duke of Lion is not so easy to come to terms with."



Peter fell silent. The Fourth Prince was absolutely right; not only the other five families, he wasn't even sure he could persuade his own father. To maintain their monopoly, they had to revise the trade scheme, but he simply did not have the authority to make a final decision. He was called an ambassador, but in reality, he was just a mouthpiece. Perhaps the Duke didn't want anyone making deals with Border Town on their own, whether with the former lord or the Fourth Prince. That's why different people were appointed every year and every season, and these people were never the decision-makers of the family.



Regardless of the outcome, he had to try. With that thought, Peter laid out his final offer. "Thirty percent," he held up three fingers, "Stronghold will buy ores and rough gemstones at a price thirty percent below market value. I believe this price should be higher than what Willow Town is offering, Your Highness."



Roland spread his hands. "Indeed higher, but the old question remains: can what you say become a unanimous decision among the six families?"



"I will set off back to Longsong Stronghold tomorrow. Once an agreement is reached, I will return with a new contract."



"But my people cannot wait that long. You should know, it usually takes a lot of time for the nobility to reach an agreement."

"Your Highness, it would be a better choice for you and your subjects to cooperate with the stronghold. Willow Town is too far away, although it is possible to avoid the Evil Months there," Peter said, feeling his throat go dry, "but it is easy to... encounter danger on the way."

My God, by the heavens, what am I doing, his heart pounded wildly, am I threatening a prince?

"Hahaha," unexpectedly, Roland did not fly into a rage but burst into laughter, "Mister Ambassador, it seems you have misunderstood something, I have no intention of going to Willow Town."

"You mean..."

"Of course, I also have no plans to go to Longsong Stronghold," Roland said with an amused look as he watched the ambassador, "I'm not going anywhere."

Peter began to doubt his own ears.

Fortunately, the prince did not let this eerie silence continue. He went on to explain, "This winter, I will stay in Border Town. Border Town will become the new frontier of the Kingdom of Greycastle. Don't be so surprised, my friend, I'm not talking nonsense. Later, I can take you to see the newly built walls at the foot of the Northern Slope Mountain."

"Walls?"



"Yes, a stone wall connecting the mountain and Redwater River, twelve feet high and four feet wide. With this, we will be able to crush the demonic beasts at Border Town."

Peter felt his brain wasn't quite keeping up. The envoy from last season hadn't mentioned any wall, and at that time, the Lord of Border Town was still one of the stronghold's men. How could he possibly have assigned the limited manpower to build this? Does that mean the fourth prince started building the wall as soon as he arrived here? Even so, it's only been three months until now, what kind of wall could have been built in such a short time?



Wait a minute... What did His Highness just say? Twelve feet high, four feet wide, and connecting the northern slope to the Redwater River? Peter estimated in his mind, such a scale of wall would be impossible to complete in just a few years, firstly because he didn't have that many stonemasons to cut and polish the stones! Border Town is not King's City, and most of the people living here are only good for manual labor.



Before he could digest this news, Roland's next words equally stunned him.

"As for the sale of ores, starting from next year, I am willing to lower the price to fifty percent, sir, but not all will be sold to Longsong Stronghold. Because you may not need so much ore. I think you would prefer some finished metal products, such as iron shovels and iron spades, over low-profit raw ores," he said, pausing for a moment as if waiting for Peter to understand the implication of his words, "As for the raw gemstones, they will be sold through auction to the highest bidding merchant. Although I would also like to wait until the gemstones are cut before selling them for a good price, unfortunately, Border Town currently doesn't have such capability."



Do you even have the capability to build a wall in just a few months! Peter roared inwardly, and what does it mean not needing so much ore, with a mere annual output of a thousand Gold royals, even if the production increases, at most it would double! Can't Longsong Stronghold consume two thousand Gold royals? That's just too arrogant!



He suppressed the dissatisfaction in his heart and tried to maintain the last of his manners, "I've noted all that you've said, Your Highness. I will discuss it with the six families immediately upon my return. However, about the wall... I would like to see it."

"Of course," Roland smiled, "But there's no need to rush. It wouldn't be too late to set off after enjoying the capital's special pastries, right? Mister Ambassador."
