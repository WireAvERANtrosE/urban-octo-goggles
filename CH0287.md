## Preparing the Soap Factory
Western Region, Border Town.

The cleansing stones purchased from Silver City filled four ships to the brim, taking several days just to unload.

Now with ample raw materials, the soap production plan could finally be put on the agenda.

The accompanying factory and warehouse had already been completed—the soap factory was located next to the industrial park, right beside the Second Steam Engine Assembly Plant, and shared the same design. The roof, beams, and wall panels were all made of wood, slightly smaller in size. With the witches responsible for the wood cutting and hoisting work, the construction period took merely a short week.

Using cleansing stones, or natural alkali, to make soap is essentially a series of chemical reactions. The raw materials required are also quite common; apart from soda ash, a large amount of lime milk and fats are needed. Lime milk is the suspension that settles at the bottom of a container after immersing lime in water, used to react with the soda ash to produce caustic soda, which then reacts with fats to produce higher fatty acid salts and glycerol. The former is the soap, while the latter is an extremely important raw material for explosives.

Previously, when making scented soap, Roland had already experimented with the complete reaction process in the castle's backyard. The principle was basically the same, but to expand small-scale trials to mass production, it was still necessary to develop reasonable processes and standards. More importantly, professional chemical talent was needed to guide production.

For this purpose, he summoned the Chief Alchemist to his office.

"Your Highness, I have thought of a potentially feasible plan for the large-scale production of sulfuric acid you requested," Kyle Sichi burst out as soon as he entered, "However, it requires a large amount of lead, as well as blacksmiths to make containers out of the lead. I heard that one of your witches can cut metal with precision, those thunderous clanks were made by her handiwork, may I..."

"Of course, just give me the shape and dimensions of the containers you require, and I will have the Witch Union take care of it," Roland gestured for him to sit down, "I called you here today not for acid production, but for another task."



"Your Highness, I really can't spare any time for other matters recently," Kyle shook his head repeatedly, "Mass acid production is a daunting challenge, and I must devote myself fully to it." He paused, then added, "Not even my disciples can handle it, they are all assisting me in preparing for this, none of them can leave."



"Don't worry, it won't take too much of your time," Roland took a sip of tea, "And there's no need to assign your prized disciples to be in charge, just a few apprentices will do."



"Then... what is the task?"



"Making soap, which is a cheaper version of the scented soap in the convenience market. Aside from the scent, its functions are exactly the same as scented soap, it can be used for bathing, cleaning clothes, and cleaning dishes."



"Is it the saponification reaction mentioned in 'Elementary Chemistry'?" Kyle stroked his beard, "The one where sodium hydroxide reacts with fats to produce alcohol and salt?"



It was quite a peculiar feeling to hear standard chemical terms from the mouth of an alchemist, especially when those terms were ones he had coined himself. Roland managed to keep a straight face and nodded seriously, "Yes, it is the saponification reaction recorded in the ancient books. I also figured out the method for making scented soap based on it."



"So what do you need me to do? If it's not that important, I suggest postponing the production until later. After all, it's no problem for your subjects to go several days without bathing, and for clothes and dishes, just soaking them in the river water is fine."



"It's very important," the prince emphasized, "Or rather, making soap isn't important, but the by-product of the production process is something I urgently need right now."



"You mean... alcohol?" Kyle said dismissively.



"Exactly, it's glycerol, you can also call it glycerine," Roland said. "It's an extremely important ingredient, its significance is no less than that of the two acids."



"Alright," Kyle Sichi shrugged, "but I don't have the time to carry this out myself."



He exhaled lightly, dealing with the Chief Alchemist was truly a tiring task, "You just need to pick out a few clever apprentices and demonstrate it to them once. I will recruit some serfs to carry out the production, but since they are completely ignorant about chemistry, there must be someone to supervise every step." The prince paused slightly, "You can also consider it as a chemical experiment that has never been practiced before—if it were in an alchemy workshop, this process could mean the discovery of several alchemical formulas, enough to earn an apprentice the title of alchemist."



It was probably the last sentence that convinced Kyle, "If that's the case, I'll take an afternoon to teach the apprentices what you've arranged."



"Good," Roland smiled slightly, "You should also know that the most important part of the production process is to produce a sufficient amount of sodium hydroxide." He wrote down the reaction formula on the paper—before the synthetic alkali process was invented, natural alkali was the most important alkali-making material, the main component being sodium bicarbonate, which decomposes into sodium carbonate, carbon dioxide, and water when heated. Because the raw materials are abundant and the process is simple, it's still in use even in modern times. "Heat and decompose the washing stone, dissolve in water, filter, and you can get a relatively pure solution of sodium carbonate."



"Next, heat it with lime milk to get a sodium hydroxide solution, the purification method should be easy for you to come up with," he explained while writing, "Clarify, distill, mix, and repeat these steps until the concentration of the solution is such that a large amount of crystals can precipitate upon cooling."



These were all contents covered in "Elementary Chemistry," and since the two alkalis have many nicknames and are easily confused (such as caustic soda, fire alkali, pure soda, baking soda, small soda, soda, etc.), and they are important knowledge points for exams, he had memorized the relevant content in the textbook back then, so he still remembered it clearly.



"I understand," the Chief Alchemist looked over the reaction formula from start to finish, "But Your Highness, what about the fats?"



"I will arrange for someone to deliver these materials to you." Animal fats were still expensive at this time, but after the personal guard's seed procurement trip brought back olive tree seeds from Dragon Cliffs City, Border Town now had a reliable source of vegetable oil. Although currently only planted on a small scale in the backyard of the castle, with Leaf's ability to promote growth, harvesting a pile of fruit in a day was not a problem.



The extraction of olive oil is also very simple. The fruit is cold-pressed using physical means once it's ripe, and the oil can be obtained by filtering out the fragments and dregs through a filter screen, resulting in clear fats.



After briefly explaining the process of making soap and the requirements for glycerin extraction, Roland finally allowed Kyle Sichi to leave the office.



With this arrangement, once the soap factory started operating, he would have a stable channel for acquiring glycerin.



And with glycerin, it meant that true smokeless gunpowder and powerful explosives were not far from his reach.
