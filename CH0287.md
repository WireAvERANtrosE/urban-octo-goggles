## Preparing the Soap Factory
Western Region, Border Town.

A total of four boats were filled with washing stones purchased from Silver City, and it took several days just to unload them.

Now, with ample raw materials, the soap production plan should officially be put on the schedule.

The accompanying factory and warehouse had already been completed—the soap factory was located next to the industrial park, right next to the No. 2 Steam Assembly Plant, and was completely identical in design. The roofs, beams, and wall panels were all made of wood, and the size was a little smaller. With the wood cutting and hoisting work being handled by the witches, the construction period was a mere one week.

Using washing stones, or natural alkali, to make soap is essentially a series of chemical reactions. The raw materials needed are also very common; besides soda ash, a large amount of lime milk and fats are needed. Lime milk is the suspension that settles at the bottom of a container after immersing lime in water, used to react with soda ash to produce caustic soda, which then reacts with fats to produce fatty acid salts and glycerol. The former is soap, while the latter is an extremely important raw material for explosives.

Previously, when making scented soap, Roland had already tested the entire reaction process in the castle’s backyard. The principle was basically the same, but to expand the small-scale production to mass production still required establishing reasonable processes and standards, and more importantly, the guidance of professional chemical talents.

For this reason, he summoned the Chief Alchemist to his office.

"Your Highness, I have thought of a potentially feasible plan for the large-scale production of sulfuric acid that you requested," Kymo Stewel said loudly as he entered, "However, this will require a large amount of lead, as well as blacksmiths to make containers out of lead. I've heard that one of your witches can cut metal precisely, and those rumbling iron lumps were made by her, may I..."

"Of course, report the shape and size of the containers you need to me, and I will have the Witch Union take care of it," Roland gestured for him to sit, "I called you here today not for acid production, but for another task."



"Your Highness, I really can't spare any time for other matters lately," Kyle said, shaking his head repeatedly, "Mass-producing acid is a formidable challenge, and I must devote myself entirely to it." He paused, then added, "Not even my disciples will do, as they are all assisting me in preparing for this task. None can be spared."



"Don't worry, it won't take up too much of your time," Roland sipped his tea, "and there's no need to assign your prized disciples to the task, just a few apprentices will suffice."



"Then... what is the task?"



"To make soap, a cheaper version of the scented soap in the convenience market. Aside from the fragrance, its function is exactly the same as scented soap, suitable for bathing, washing clothes, and cleaning dishes."



"Is it the saponification reaction mentioned in 'Elementary Chemistry'?" Kyle stroked his beard, "The one where sodium hydroxide reacts with fat to produce alcohol and salt?"



It was indeed a peculiar feeling to hear standard chemical terminology from the mouth of an alchemist, especially since the term was one he had coined himself. Roland managed to keep a straight face and nodded earnestly, "Exactly, the saponification reaction recorded in ancient texts. It's also based on this that I figured out how to make scented soap."



"So what do you need me to do? If it's not very important, I suggest we postpone the production. After all, your subjects can go several days without a bath without any problem, and for clothes and dishes, a soak in the river will do."



"It is very important," the prince emphasized, "or rather, making the soap isn't important, but a byproduct of the production process is something I urgently need right now."



"Are you referring to... alcohol?" Kyle said skeptically.



"Yes, it's glycerol, you can also call it glycerin," Roland said. "It's an extremely important raw material, no less significant than the two acids."

"Alright," said Kymo Van'er with a shrug, "but just so you know, I don't have the time to implement this personally."

He let out a sigh; dealing with the Chief Alchemist could be exhausting, "You just need to pick a few clever apprentices and demonstrate the process to them once. I'll recruit some civilians for the production, but they know nothing about chemistry after all, so someone must supervise every step." The prince paused for a moment, "You can also consider it a chemical experiment that has never been practiced before—if it were in an alchemy workshop, this process could lead to the discovery of several alchemical formulas, enough to earn an apprentice the title of Alchemist."

It seemed that the last sentence convinced Kymo, "If that's the case, I'll set aside an afternoon to teach the apprentices what you've arranged."

"Good," Roland said with a slight smile, "you should also know that the most important part of the production process is to produce a sufficient amount of sodium hydroxide," he wrote the reaction formula on a piece of paper—before the synthetic alkali process was invented, natural alkali was the most important raw material for making alkali, the main component being sodium bicarbonate, which decomposes into sodium carbonate, carbon dioxide, and water when heated. Because the raw materials are abundant and the process is simple, it is still in use even in modern times. "Heat and decompose trona, dissolve in water, and filter to obtain a relatively pure solution of sodium carbonate."

"Next, heat it with lime milk to obtain a sodium hydroxide solution, and you can easily think of the purification method," he explained as he wrote, "clarify, distill, mix, and repeat this step until the solution is concentrated enough to crystallize out in large quantities upon cooling."

These were all topics covered in "Elementary Chemistry." Because the two alkalis have many aliases and can be easily confused (such as caustic soda, soda ash, baking soda, etc.), and they are important points for exams, he had memorized the relevant content from textbooks, so he still remembered it clearly.

"I understand," the Chief Alchemist reviewed the reaction formula from beginning to end, "but Your Highness, what about the fats and oils?"

"I will arrange for someone to deliver these materials to you." Animal fats were still expensive at this time, but ever since the trip by the personal guards to purchase seeds brought back olive tree seeds from the Dragon Ridge, Border Town had a reliable source of plant oil. Although for now, they were only planted on a small scale in the castle's backyard, with Leaf's ability to accelerate growth, harvesting a pile of fruits in one day was not a problem.



The extraction of olive oil is also very simple; the fruit is cold-pressed using physical methods when ripe, and the oil is then passed through a filter to remove any fragments and dregs, resulting in clear fat.



After briefly explaining the process of making soap and the requirements for glycerin collection, Roland allowed Kemo Squirrel to leave the office.



With this arrangement, once the soap factory was up and running, he would have a stable source of glycerin.



And with glycerin, it meant that real smokeless gunpowder and powerful explosives were now not far from his reach.
