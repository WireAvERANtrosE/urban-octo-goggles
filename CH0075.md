## Holy Mountain (Part 1)
Cara felt the person beneath her breathing rapidly.



"Switch out," she said in a deep voice, "Leaf, you carry me."



Walking in the hollows of the Impassable Mountain Range was extremely exhausting, especially during the snowy winter. The forty-two witches could not travel far in a day and had to find a suitable campsite and recharge their badges to resist the sudden drop in temperature at night.



"Yes, Teacher." A witch crouched down in front of her, and she summoned a magic snake to wrap around the other's arm, pulling herself over. At the same time, she noticed the other's involuntary slight tremor.



Damn Nightingale, Cara thought bitterly, if she hadn't repeatedly rejected my mercy, I would not have hardened my heart to strike down a sister. At this critical moment, when the Holy Mountain was nearly found, Cara would not allow any mishaps.



What was the result? That traitor, once freed, didn't hesitate to try to stab her to death... Look, this is what comes of mercy! Rage boiled in Cara's mind; that stab had injured her spine, and though the wound had been quickly healed by Leaf's improved herbs, her lower body was paralyzed and her feet had completely lost sensation.



Once we reach the Holy Mountain and gather more witches, one day I will have her captured and torn to pieces!



"Teacher, there are demonic beasts approaching ahead."



Redlotus, who was in charge of scouting, reported. Her eyes could ignore barriers and obstructions, and no trap could hide from her. She also had an exceptional ability to capture moving objects and had personally shot down the bolts of the Judgement Army during the confrontation with the Church.



"Put me down, Leaf, go and assist them."

The witch carrying her nodded, crouched down, and set her on a rock. Her hands, bracing her body, sank into the snow, and the cold sensation passed through her palms. Cara thought somewhat displeasedly, couldn't you have brushed off the snow before putting me down?



But she didn't voice her complaint. Leaf was an irreplaceable member of the team. If the Association was held together by Wendy's good-natured temperament, Leaf was the assurance that gave everyone the courage to continue following her. Without her abilities, it was likely that more than half of the witches would have died on the roads, fleeing from the Church's pursuit.



Thinking of Wendy, Cara couldn't help but feel a pang of pain in her heart; she had never expected that the person who had founded the Association with her would betray her because of Nightingale.



Even when Wendy had blown her away, Cara had never thought of killing her. The poison secreted by the 'Pain' magical snake took effect slowly, causing unbearable pain but not immediately fatal. After being bitten by the 'Void', the toxin could be quickly neutralized... She merely wanted to give Wendy a taste of suffering. But left untreated, the toxin entering the brain was still incurable. It was a mistake for Nightingale to take her away; without the antidote from 'Void', Wendy wouldn't last a day.



Was it predestined that she, once a nun of the Church, could not walk to the end with her sisters?



As for the other defector, Lightning, Cara wasn't too concerned. She had joined the Association only recently, her ability appeared to be flight, and she was always suggesting different opinions when searching for clues about the Holy Mountain, even openly questioning the Holy Scriptures. If it weren't against the principles of the Association, Cara really wanted to petrify this talkative little girl and leave her in the snow.



Evil beasts poked their heads out from behind the hillside – two wolf-like creatures. The witches of the Association were adept at dealing with this kind of situation. Those without combat abilities gathered towards the rear. Leaf was the first to drive her magic, causing the weeds under the evil beasts' feet to grow wildly, green leaves breaking through the snow in an instant, entwining around the enemies' feet. Another witch, Pursuit Wind, drained the air around the evil beasts, and soon the two creatures fell into a state of asphyxiation, foaming at the mouth and convulsing on the ground.



This is the power of witches, Cara thought. Mortals armed only with swords would lose their lives in the blink of an eye against two evil wolves. Only witches, blessed with miraculous magic, were the favorites of the deities. If not for the God's Punishment Stones—no, more accurately, Hell's Stones, she spat on the ground, if not for those accursed stones, how would the Church dare to ride roughshod over them?



"Lord Tutor, please come up here," Leaf walked over to Cara and bent down to say.

"Let's change to someone else," Cara sighed, "you just got tired too."

The group continued on their way, and by noon, the snowfall began to weaken. The Stone Girl in charge of setting up the camp found a sheltered spot. Everyone decided to take a short break here and have a meal to replenish their expended energy.

Stone Girl quickly transformed the land; the snow was pressed down by the churned-up soil and gravel, and the ground seemed to come to life, intertwining and wriggling on its own, and in no time became flat and hard. Everyone busied themselves with their tasks, setting up the pots they carried, lighting fires, and cooking porridge. Snow was boiled in cups, mixed with some of the herbs improved by Leaf, and immediately exuded a rich fragrance.

"Everyone, hand your badges over to Sino," a little girl with rare red hair, which looked like a leaping flame, called out. Her ability was also related to fire; she could infuse an object with heat, making it warm for a long time. The Mutual Aid Society's badge—the Sacred Mountain coin—was made by her.

It seemed like an insignificant ability, but it was of great help to the Mutual Aid Society, especially when operating in the Impassable Mountain Range. Without a warming object, it was easy to suffer from hypothermia in the cold wind and heavy snow and faint.

After finishing the wheat porridge, everyone packed up their gear, ready to continue on their way. According to Cara's speculation, the so-called Gate of Hell was actually the key to the Sacred Mountain. It was just that the church deliberately portrayed it as a land of evil, hoping to prevent witches from reaching the Sacred Mountain. According to ancient records, they needed to pass through three stone gates, with the last one located in the Barbarian Land. Usually hidden deep underground, it would only rise to the surface when the sky showed a blood-red moon.

They had set out from the camp and had been walking in the Impassable Mountain Range for about half a month. They would soon leave the range and enter the Barbarian Land. In the past few days, the appearances of demonic beasts had also become more frequent.

"Quick, quick, look... what is that?" Suddenly someone shouted in horror.



Cara lifted her head, then was so astonished that she was left gaping in amazement.

A city emerged on the horizon!

The gray, overcast sky continued to drift with snowflakes, the clouds pressed low, and the outline of the city loomed indistinctly through the mist.

The style of those buildings was something she had never seen before, like a row of spires standing side by side. If the dense black dots on them were windows, then those spires must be at least a hundred zhang tall! This was definitely not something humans could achieve! Even the Hermes Church's pride, the great cathedral known as the Tower of Heaven, was only fifteen zhang at its highest point!

Since it was not the work of human hands, there was only one answer left: it was a city built by the gods!

Cara was so excited she could hardly contain herself, a voice in her heart kept shouting—

She had found the Holy Mountain!
