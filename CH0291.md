In the palace of Greycastle, Timothy held the scepter, looking down at the smug Chief Alchemist, Reilly Cheney.



"Have you got any leads on the alchemy formula that the defector Poll took with him?"



"Yes, Your Majesty, this is the latest snow powder developed by the Alchemy Association. Please allow me to demonstrate it for you," Reilly bowed.



After getting the new king's nod, he waved his hand backward, and immediately two disciples came forward, each holding a pouch. He spread two pieces of white paper on the ground, poured the snow powder from the pouches onto them, and formed two fine lines. One line was a light gray-white, while the other was much darker, close to gray-black.



"Your Majesty, please look at this lighter one, this is the original snow powder used for celebrations, while this darker one is the newly developed quick-burning snow powder." Reilly took out a flint, ignited the powder on the paper, and the light-colored snow powder burned slowly, emitting billowing smoke, whereas the dark-colored one burned out in a few breaths, also igniting the white paper underneath.



"What does this mean?" Timothy frowned. "The stuff that my dear sister got, it's not just about burning a piece of paper!"



"Of course not, Your Majesty," Reilly stroked his beard and smiled, "I wonder if you've noticed the smoke released when it burns. The faster the snow powder burns, the more smoke it releases in a short time, and that's why it's so powerful. I will prove this with another experiment."



This time, it was two fist-sized parchment packages, wrapped tightly on the outside, with the disciples igniting a long thin fuse sticking out of the packages and then covering the packages with two copper bowls. The sparks followed the fuse, gradually moving towards the copper bowls.



"Your Majesty, please notice, this time the sound will be quite loud, please cover your ears."



The words of the Chief Alchemist had just finished when there was a loud bang, a copper bowl flipped upside down, and another was thrown onto the roof, where it bounced a few times on the granite slabs, emitting a crisp clanging sound.

Damn it! Timothy clenched the scepter that almost slipped from his hand, swallowing saliva involuntarily, why didn't this old thing say it earlier!

Two disciples brought the shaken copper bowl before the new king. He suppressed the anger in his heart, focusing his attention on the bowl—the other party was, after all, the pillar of the Alchemy Association of the capital, and he still needed his help for the time being if he wanted to study alchemical weapons.

The copper bowl had now changed its appearance, looking as if it had been struck hard from the inside by a hammer, the rim of the bowl bulging out.

"I have verified it repeatedly, the power of the snow powder is not in burning, but in these gases; this is also the true reason why Pol took the recipe away." Rayleigh stood in the middle of the hall and spoke confidently, "If we increase the amount of snow powder and compress it tightly, its power is enough to rip armor apart and dismember a person. I believe that this new type of snow powder will surely replace swords, spears, bows and arrows, and even a well-trained knight is no match for a commoner covered in snow powder pouches."

This statement caused a stir, Timothy saw several knights' faces visibly darken in the hall, with Steelheart Knight Weimar apparently wanting to step forward and argue, he hurriedly tapped the floor with his scepter, "Quiet!"

When everyone lowered their heads, he then looked towards Rayleigh Cheney, "Is the formula that the defector took away exactly the same as the one you developed?"

"No, Your Majesty," Rayleigh shook his head, a trace of disdain in his words, "Saltpeter, though a common item in alchemy workshops, is not in large supply. He just happened to stumble upon this formula when he was grinding and preparing the snow powder, and even if he wanted to experiment further, that small amount wouldn't be enough for him to use many times. My quick-burning snow powder, however, is the optimal formula obtained after extensive testing, and its power is far greater than that of a product of chance."

"That's good to hear." Timothy breathed a sigh of relief. Although he knew that there were many of Grace's arranged people in the royal city, he did not expect there to be her confidants in the Alchemy Association. This defection was orchestrated by a confidant who took the alchemist Pol and more than ten apprentices away. It was not a big deal in itself, as alchemists were very rare in other cities, and there were at least twenty in the capital, so the departure of one was insignificant. However, this person had discovered a very lethal type of snow powder before leaving and did not contribute the alchemical formula to the association before disappearing without a trace the next day.



Timothy's spy only managed to grab the confidant left behind to confuse the enemy, but failed to intercept Boer and his crew. Upon receiving the news, he immediately ordered the Prime Minister to buy up all the saltpeter in the city and demanded that the Alchemy Association quickly reproduce Boer's snow powder formula. Now, after two months, there were clear results, which pleased him greatly, and even this old fellow, who had been somewhat disrespectful to him, seemed much more agreeable.



Timothy cleared his throat, "Well done, I will reward you with twenty-five gold royals. In addition, I will set up a snow powder workshop within the inner city of the capital, to mass-produce this quick-burning snow powder, but you must not slacken, and should continue to research its applications. If it truly can do as you say, allowing commoners to defeat knights, then granting you a noble title and lands would not be out of the question."



"Thank you, Your Majesty!"



After the chief alchemist left, Sir Weimas couldn't help but step forward and say, "Your Highness, although this thing seems terrifying, it is impossible to use it to defeat knights. You have seen it too, it needs to be ignited, and the lethal range is only about half a step. Before a commoner gets close to me, I have dozens of ways to make them fall dead. Even if they get close, I can take advantage of the ignition gap to kill my opponent and then leave calmly. Ryle's words are nothing more than the delusions of someone who has never been on the battlefield."



"We think so too, Your Majesty," the other knights said in unison.



"That's why I have asked him to continue exploring better ways to use it," Timothy reassured, "such as shortening the ignition time, or making it throwable, and so on. Of course, no matter what kind of weapon, I believe that knights will handle it better than farmers."



Although he said this, he also had some doubts. Commoners were indeed useless, cowardly, ignorant, and afraid of death, but with the control of the pills, snow powder could become a powerful weapon. At least in storming gates and shielded lines of defense, only a few berserk militiamen armed with snow powder were needed to get close to the target to tear a hole in the solid defense.



Just then, hurried footsteps sounded from outside the door, and a guard entered the palace hall anxiously, kneeling on one knee and saying, "Your Majesty, the militia you sent to the Western Territory seems to have suffered heavy losses, and now the fleeing soldiers have returned to the capital, bringing with them a letter of reprimand from Roland Wimbledon. Now, many people are aware of this."



"What?" Timothy was stunned, "Quick, make them shut their mouths, and bring everyone who is still alive to the castle!"



...

In the castle courtyard, a group of ragged militiamen knelt on the ground, pleading, "Your Majesty, please grant us some pills, I really can't take it anymore."

You useless fools, apart from exhausting the enemy, you are good for nothing, living only to waste food, and you dare to ask me for pills? Timothy coldly looked at these people and asked in a deep voice, "Exactly how did you lose to the opponent? What happened during the battle? Whoever can explain clearly, I will grant them the antidote."

The crowd immediately started clamoring, "We were attacked on the ship, and the fleet quickly fell into chaos. The knights ordered us to land and regroup, but once ashore, we were continuously shot at with crossbows, and the firing was so dense that we couldn't fight back. The knights surrendered first, and we... we followed suit."

"Where is the leading knight?"

"I... I don't know, they took us back to their camp, but we didn't see the knight."

Timothy frowned, his voice growing colder, "Then how did you come back?"

"Prince Roland let us go," one of them quickly said, "He also gave us a letter to deliver to you."

"You?"



"Yes, I have one here too!"

"Your Majesty, I have a letter as well!"

A group of people hurriedly called out, each taking out a 'letter' from Roland from their bosoms.

Damn it! Did he really send one of these to everyone? Timothy signaled his guards to take the letters, only to find that the same message was written on all of them.



"Your foolish actions fill me with regret, Timothy Wimbledon. Repeatedly invading the Western Territory is a grave mistake, and you will pay the price for it. I will launch an attack on the capital at the beginning of the second month of autumn, and you will find that your position is far less secure than you imagine. By then, all the citizens of the capital will see that your throne is already teetering."



"— Roland Wimbledon."
