Inside the royal palace of Greycastle, Timothy held the scepter, looking down at the smug expression of the Chief Alchemist, Kyle Sichi.



"Have you made any progress on the alchemy formula taken away by the defector, Pol?"



"Yes, Your Majesty, this is the latest flash powder developed by the Alchemist Association, please allow me to demonstrate it for you," Kyle bowed.



After receiving the new king's nod, he waved his hand backward, and immediately two disciples came forward, each carrying a pouch. He spread two pieces of white paper on the ground, poured the flash powder from the pouches onto them, and formed two fine lines. One of the lines was a light grayish-white, while the other was much darker, nearing a grayish-black color.



"Your Majesty, please observe, this lighter one is the original flash powder used for celebrations, and the darker one is the newly developed quick-burning flash powder." Kyle took out a flint and lit the powder on the paper. The light-colored powder burned slowly, emitting thick smoke, while the dark-colored one burned up completely within a few breaths, also igniting the white paper underneath.



"What does this mean?" Timothy frowned, "The toys my dear sister obtained, they're not just for burning a piece of paper!"



"Of course not, Your Majesty," Kyle said, stroking his beard and smiling, "I don't know if you've noticed the smoke released when it burns. The faster the flash powder burns, the more smoke it releases in a short time, and this is why it is so powerful. I will use another experiment to prove this."



This time, it was two fist-sized paper packages, wrapped tightly in sheepskin. The disciples lit the long fuses sticking out of the paper packages and then placed two copper bowls over the packages. The sparks followed the fuses, gradually making their way to the copper bowls.



"Your Majesty, please note, this time the sound will be quite loud, please block your ears."



No sooner had the chief alchemist's voice fallen than a loud bang was heard. A copper bowl was flipped upside down, and another was thrown onto the roof, bouncing a few times on the granite slabs and making a crisp clashing sound.



Damn it! Timothy clenched the scepter that had almost slipped from his grasp and unconsciously swallowed his saliva. Why didn’t this old man speak up earlier!



Two disciples brought the blown away copper bowl before the new king. He suppressed the anger in his heart and focused his attention on the bowl—the other party was, after all, a pillar of the Alchemist Association in King's City, and he still needed his help to research alchemical weapons.



The copper bowl now looked transformed, as if it had been severely hammered from the inside, the rim bulging out.



"I have verified it repeatedly, the power of the snow powder lies not in combustion, but in these gases. That is also the true reason why Pol took the formula with him," Rayleigh said confidently, standing in the center of the hall. "If you increase the amount of snow powder and compress it tightly, its power is enough to tear apart armor and rip the human body into pieces. I believe that this new type of snow powder will replace swords, spears, and bows. Even well-trained knights cannot stand against a commoner covered in snow powder bags."



This statement caused some commotion. Timothy saw several knights in the hall whose expressions darkened noticeably, among them, the Steel Heart Knight Weimar seemed to want to step forward and argue with the other party. He quickly tapped the floor with his scepter, "Silence!"



When everyone bowed their heads, he then looked at Rayleigh Cheney, "Is the formula taken by that defector the same as the one you developed?"



"No, Your Majesty," Rayleigh shook his head, a hint of disdain in his tone, "Saltpeter may be a staple in the Alchemy Workshop, but the stock is not abundant. When he was grinding and configuring the snow powder, he just happened to come across this formula. Even if he wanted to experiment further, that amount would not be enough for many uses. My quick-burning snow powder, on the other hand, is the optimal formula derived from extensive testing, with far greater power than a product of chance."



"That is well," Timothy breathed a sigh of relief. Although he knew that there were many people in the King's City arranged by Grace beforehand, he did not expect that the Alchemy Association had her confidants. This defection was orchestrated by a confidant, leading away the alchemist Pol and more than a dozen apprentices. It would not be a big deal normally, as alchemists were rare in other cities, and there were at least twenty in King's City. The loss of one was insignificant, but unfortunately, this person discovered a highly lethal snow powder before leaving and did not contribute the alchemical formula to the association before disappearing without a trace the next day.



Timothy's spies only managed to capture the confidants who stayed behind to confuse the enemy but failed to intercept Boer and his party. Upon receiving the news, he immediately ordered the Prime Minister to purchase all the saltpeter in the city and requested the Alchemy Association to quickly reproduce Boer's snow powder formula. Now, after two months, there was a clear result, which pleased him greatly, and he even started to look favorably upon the old man who had shown him some disrespect.



Timothy cleared his throat, "Well done, I will reward you with twenty-five Gold Royals as a prize. In addition, I will set up a snow powder workshop within the inner city of the King's City to produce this quick-burning snow powder in large quantities, and you must not slack off. You should further research its uses. If it really can do as you say, enabling commoners to defeat knights, I will have no problem rewarding you with a noble title and land."



"Thank you, Your Majesty!"



After the Chief Alchemist left, Sir Weimas couldn't help but stand out and say, "Your Highness, although this thing looks frightening, it is absolutely impossible to use it to defeat knights. As you have seen, it requires ignition to work, and the lethal range is only about half a step. Before a commoner gets close to me, I have dozens of ways to make them fall dead. Even if they get close, I can take the opportunity to kill them during the ignition gap and then leave calmly. What Riley said is nothing more than the imagination of someone who has never been on a battlefield."



"We think so too, Your Majesty." Other knights chimed in.



"That's why I asked him to continue exploring better ways to use it," Timothy reassured them, "such as shortening the ignition time or making it throwable, and so on. Of course, no matter what kind of weapon it is, I believe knights will handle it better than farmers."



Although he said this, he had some doubts in his heart. Commoners were indeed useless, cowardly, ignorant, and afraid of death, but with the control of the pills, snow powder could become a powerful weapon. At the very least, when assaulting city gates and shield lines, only a few frenzied militiamen armed with snow powder would need to approach the target to tear a hole in the solid defense.



Just then, footsteps suddenly sounded outside the door, and a guard hurried into the palace hall and knelt on one knee, "Your Majesty, the militia you sent to the Western Territory seems to have suffered heavy losses, and the defeated troops have now returned to King's City. It is said they also brought back a letter of censure from Roland Wimbledon, and many people already know about this."



"What?" Timothy was stunned. "Quick, make them shut their mouths, and bring all the survivors to the castle!"



In the castle courtyard, a group of ragged militiamen knelt on the ground like mud, pleading, "Your Majesty, please bestow some pills upon us, I truly can't bear it anymore."



"You bunch of waste, other than exhausting the enemy, you're utterly useless, living is just a waste of food, and you still dare to ask me for pills?" Timothy coldly looked at this group of people and asked in a deep voice, "How exactly did you lose to the opponent? What about the battle process? Whoever can explain clearly, I will reward them with an antidote."



The crowd immediately started to clamor, "We were attacked while still on the ships, and the fleet quickly descended into chaos. The knights ordered us to land and regroup, but once we were ashore, we were continuously shot at with crossbows, the shooting was so dense that we couldn't fight back. The knights surrendered first, and we followed... we surrendered too."



"Where is the leading knight?"



"I... I don't know, they took us back to their camp, but we didn't see the knight."



Timothy frowned, his voice growing colder, "Then how did you make it back?"



"It was Prince Roland who let us go," someone quickly said, "He also gave us a letter, asking us to hand it over to you."



"You?"



"Yes, I have one here too!"

"Your Majesty, I too have a letter!"

A group of people hurriedly shouted, each taking out a 'letter' from Roland from their bosoms.

Damn it! Did he really send one of these to everyone? Timothy gestured for his guards to take the letters, only to find that the same message was written on all of them.



"Your foolish actions have filled me with regret, Timothy Wimbledon. Repeatedly invading the Western Territory is a grave mistake, and you will pay the price for it. I will launch an assault on the capital at the beginning of the second month of autumn, and you will find that your position is far less secure than you imagine. By then, all the citizens of the capital will see that your throne is on the verge of collapsing."



— Roland Wimbledon.
