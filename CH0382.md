## Final Exam
The day of the final exam arrived swiftly.



The witches were all seated in the hall, waiting for Teacher Scroll to distribute the test papers.

Andrea elegantly groomed her nails with a small knife, her thoughts already drifting to dinner—according to Prince Roland's words, after today's exam, the first term of studies would come to an end. To celebrate, everyone would receive a portion of ice cream bread.

For her, this meant the number of bread portions she could eat would be far more than just one.

These days, whenever she had free time, she would compete with Ashes and Sylvie in playing Fight the Landlord, a game that required a certain level of strategy and skill, somewhat similar to the Noble's Game of Beast Chess that was popular among the upper class, focusing on playing to one's strengths and planning moves ahead. Compared to this, she considered herself no less skilled than Lady Tilly, and Ashes was certainly out of the question, a fact that had been proven. She now had six ice cream bread IOUs in her hand, four from Ashes and two from Sylvie. In other words, as long as His Highness arranged for this delicacy in the dessert, they would have to hand them over to her.

Today was clearly a day of bountiful harvest, and by dinner time, she would be able to enjoy three portions of ice cream bread all to herself, enough to eat her fill!

As for the exam, Andrea was naturally confident.

Ever since she heard about it, she had asked Sylvie about the previous test and even tried the questions herself. She found that the exam was very simple, roughly equivalent to the enlightenment of knowledge for nobles, mainly focusing on literacy and some so-called arithmetic knowledge, which was the simplest kind of profit and loss calculation, not even on par with the level of a steward's accounting, let alone the family's financial trade calculations. In this respect, she was recognized as a prodigy within her family, able to verify accounts by the age of fifteen.

To do everything to the best of one's ability—this was the style of a noble.



The test papers were quickly distributed.

There were three questionnaires in total, and Andrea quickly scanned them before looking up. The three sheets were labeled with tests for Kingdom Language, Basic Arithmetic, and Elementary Science.

Good, exactly the same as last time.

She couldn't help but curl the corners of her mouth upwards, spreading out the Kingdom Language test first, picking up the quill, and starting to write directly.

It only took her a quarter of an hour to finish the questions on the paper. Although the vocabulary was more extensive than last time and there were a few more peculiar types of questions, such as "reading comprehension" and "cloze tests," none of these presented a challenge to her. It was just about understanding the content to answer the questions and completing the sentences—nothing more than making a mystery out of something simple.

Next was Basic Arithmetic.

The beginning was still the simple profit and loss calculations, but gradually, Andrea's pace slowed down.

What does this mean? Two lines crossing with several dots above them, described by an equation?

Her heart tightened suddenly, that feeling of flipping through "The Basics of Natural Science Theory" surfacing once again. Why couldn't she understand the meaning when she recognized every word?



The following questions were the same.

Andrea felt beads of sweat forming on her forehead.

She took a deep breath, held it in, and quietly turned her head to look at Nightingale in the row behind—being of noble birth as well, could she offer any hints?

But the expression on her face made Andrea's heart sink.

Nightingale was staring blankly at the paper, with the quill pen held in her mouth, her eyes not moving for a long time.

Could it be that the questions were too difficult?

Lady Tilly did not attend the exam, and the legendary talented Miss Anna was nowhere to be seen, while the people around her were still wrestling with the first page, offering no chance for reference.



Another quarter of an hour passed, and everyone started turning to the second sheet. Even so, their pens never stopped for a moment, and even Maggie was continuously writing—good heavens, she didn't even hold the pen correctly, gripping the quill in her fist like a claw. Could she possibly answer the questions that way?

Finally, Andrea could not contain herself any longer. Pretending to have finished the basic arithmetic paper, she flipped to the last one on elementary natural studies.



However, compared to the simple question and answer session last time, this time there were numbers and indecipherable symbols. Wait... Did this require calculations too?

Suddenly, she felt that things were deviating from her expectations.

The only consolation was that Ashes had stopped writing quite early on, clearly just as stumped by the questions.

But... damn it, she thought angrily, what was there to be happy about defeating a big idiot whose head was filled with muscles?

In her anxiety, the exam came to an end, and Andrea leaned back in her chair, watching as the papers in front of her were collected, suddenly feeling that the three servings of ice cream she had planned for the evening didn't seem as sweet.

...

"Your Highness, here are all the exam papers," Scroll placed a stack of papers on the desk, "Do you really want to check the results yourself?"

"That's right," Roland said with a smile, "Sometimes marking papers can be a pleasure."

For example, he could see many bizarre answers, or capture the pain and torment of the respondents between the lines, which served as spiritual nourishment during his leisure time.



"Shall I help you tally the scores?"  

"That would be great." He nodded and then called out, "Nightingale, no peeking."  

"I know that already," Nightingale materialized from the recliner and pouted, "Why doesn't Anna have to take the exam? Shouldn't all the sisters of the Witch Union be involved now that the studies are over?"  

Roland couldn't help but laugh, "Because she and the Scroll came up with the test paper."  

Her voice faltered, and it took her a long time to speak again, "What about your sister then?"  

"Tilly... she acted as the examiner, going through the paper beforehand to check for any oversight," the prince explained with a shrug, "By the way, she scored full marks."  

Nightingale's figure seemed to suddenly become very heavy.  

With a helpless shake of his head, Roland began to grade the papers.  

...



After all the scores were tallied up, he stretched lazily. This time, the witches from Sleeping Island had made significant progress in the final exam. Candle, Evelyn, and Sylvie who stayed behind all passed, with Evelyn showing the most improvement. Her score rose from five last time to sixty-two this time. Although still the lowest among the three, it was clear she had put in considerable effort.



However, the new combat witches generally scored poorly, with none of them exceeding fifty points. This was probably due to the shorter teaching time, coupled with the reduced weight of the Kingdom Language score, so their unsatisfactory performance was understandable.



But Nightingale was a disaster. Despite studying along with everyone else, her total score for the three subjects was even lower than last time, which left Roland feeling somewhat amused yet helpless. It seemed that learning really was a talent, and sometimes it simply couldn't be forced.



The only one that puzzled him was Maggie.



She hardly got any of the calculation questions for mathematics and natural sciences correct, and the formulas she used were completely wrong. Yet, she managed to get ninety percent of the multiple-choice and true/false questions correct, ultimately scoring sixty-three points, which was truly bewildering.



How on earth did she manage to do that?



Roland was at a loss for an explanation.
