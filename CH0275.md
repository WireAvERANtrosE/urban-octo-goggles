## Lucia and Nightingale
Lucia carefully arranged the three iron ingots on the floor of her bedroom, then closed her eyes, took a deep breath, and reviewed in her mind all the sensations from past practices before extending her hands and releasing her ability to surround the target.

This was a training method devised by Anna, and the iron ingots were also specially made by her—each of the three wrought iron ingots contained different components, having been fused with silver, copper, lead, as well as some impurities. Now, what she needed to do was to revert them back to their elemental forms while retaining the impurities and identifying the ingot with the highest silver content.

This meant that she had to control the output of her magic power and operate on the target only once.

Otherwise, the impurities would be further dissociated—this was also the reason why she felt that her abilities were difficult to control when she was at her home in Valencia. The same paper, after being reverted, yielded completely different products, all because she had not understood the relationship between the magnitude of magic power and the effects of her abilities, resulting in some sheets of paper being continuously broken down several times, until most of the original materials had turned into water and gases.

After coming to Border Town, the first lesson the witches taught her was to control her own magic power during practice.

Lucia had not really believed that such an intangible and untouchable thing could be precisely controlled until Anna demonstrated on the spot how to measure length with Darkfire, and then she realized how wrong she had been. The other party could even adjust the size and thickness of the Darkfire by regulating the output of magic power, and each time with pinpoint accuracy.

"Sis, are you practicing again?" Ring curiously poked her head out from the bed. "We've just had lunch."

Lucia's hand trembled, and one of the iron ingots instantly turned into several piles of powder.

"I've said not to disturb me when I'm using my ability," she turned her head and gave her sister a knock on the head, "Focus on your book!"



"I don't understand," Lily pouted, "I don't know the meaning of half the words, and I'm not like Sister, who can read and write."

"That's why you need to look at it more," she was told. "Many words have a similar structure, and even if you haven't seen them before, you should be able to guess their meaning. Learning to read is a process of familiarization."

"Alright." Lily withdrew her head.

Lucia refocused her attention on the second iron ingot, controlling the magic power to flow out slowly, imagining it in her mind as a thin veil, gently covering the target, and wrapping it evenly.

"Hey, I'm here," the door suddenly creaked open, and a blonde woman flashed into the room, "Oh, are you practicing your abilities?"

"Sister Nightingale!" Lily cried out in delight.

The second iron ingot turned back into dust.

Lucia sighed and collected all the metal fragments on the ground into a leather bag, feeling that she probably wouldn't be able to practice anymore this afternoon.

"Here, this is for you."



A creamy and fragrant ice cream was handed over to her.

"Thank you," Lucia took the ice cream, "But isn't this only given out during afternoon tea?"

Nightingale proudly patted her chest, "This is a reward I specially requested from His Highness, and by the way... you have a share too." She handed another one to Lily, eliciting a burst of laughter from the little girl.

"Sister Nightingale is the best to me!"

This girl, Lucia thought helplessly, always forgets about herself when there's good food. But the moment the ice cream entered her mouth, she felt that if she were the younger sister, her reaction would probably be the same as Lily's—The rich honey and milk flavors melted in her mouth, and the cold, refreshing texture fused them together, amplifying the sweetness even further. Even after swallowing, a cool sensation lingered between her lips and teeth.

No one could resist its delicious taste, especially in the heat of summer. No wonder His Highness only distributed ice cream during the afternoon tea on weekends. Such a uniquely styled dessert must be quite valuable; at least she had never heard of such a sweet treat in the city of Valencia.

With that thought, Lucia couldn't help but ask, "How did you ask His Highness for it?"

"Hehe," Nightingale lifted the corner of her mouth, "I ranked third in this test, only behind Wendy and Leaf. However, Roland His Highness thought I wouldn't pass. With such a big discrepancy from the actual situation, I naturally had to ask him for a reward."

"Is that so..." she hesitated for a moment, "What about me, then?"



"Sixty-eight points, I'm not sure what rank that is."

"Ugh, that's pretty low," Lucia said dejectedly. Out of a total of 120 points, she had only gotten just over half right, and that was on the basis that she had already learned how to read.

"It's not bad," Nightingale patted her head. "After all, you haven't been following the lessons for long, so it's natural that you would be a bit weaker in math and science. If you have any questions you don't understand, you can ask me."

"Can I ask questions too?" Wendy raised her hand.

"Of course," Nightingale responded with a smile, "you're welcome anytime."

"Once I pass the elementary assessment, does that mean I can choose my own job?"

"You're still too early for that. His Highness has said that the minimum age to start working is fourteen, and you're only ten. What's the rush?" Lucia gave her a look.

The young girl retorted without giving in, "I want to help relieve your burden as soon as possible. Like getting married and having children, that must cost a lot of money, right? If you don't have enough, life will be very hard!"

"Who did you hear that from?" Lucia said, holding her forehead.



"Daddy always complains that he's almost unable to support us," the girl said.



"Pfft," Nightingale couldn't help but laugh, "If you could start working, where would you choose to go?"



"The chemistry lab!" Ling raised her hand, "I want to become an alchemist, earn the title of a Sage, and receive everyone's admiration and praise!"



"That's... probably not a good idea," she shook her head, "The lab is actually quite dangerous."



"Dangerous?" The two sisters exclaimed in unison.



"Yes," Nightingale spread her hands, "Not only do you often deal with acids, but there are also occasional explosions. Even the Chief Alchemist can't avoid accidents. Last time, he lost four fingers in an explosion. If it weren't for Nana, Mr. Kyle Sichi might never have been able to pick up those bottles and jars again." She paused, "Moreover, His Highness seems to be planning to develop a new kind of gunpowder recently, which he considers extremely dangerous and requires a separate laboratory for its preparation."



"Uh, in that case, do you have any good suggestions?" Lucia embraced Ling firmly, determined not to let her sister work in such a frightful place.



"Of course, it's to enter the City Hall and become a civil servant."



"Civil... servant?" she repeated.



"Cough cough, that's just how His Highness talks to himself. To put it simply, it's like a city hall official," Nightingale coughed twice, "Both stable and safe, with above-average pay, but good prospects. Once you become a department head, the compensation is no less than a witch's."



"I see," Lucia said thoughtfully.



"Sister Nightingale, do you like His Highness?" Wendy blurted out, "You say 'His Highness says' a lot in your sentences. Mom says you only talk like that about someone you really like."



Lucia's face stiffened at her sister's question. Damn it, how could she ask something like that so bluntly? It was simply too impolite. Even if it was just a regular friend, you couldn't just ask about such things, let alone someone she admired as a senior. She hurriedly covered Wendy's mouth, intending to apologize, but then she heard Nightingale answer frankly—



"Yes, I do like him."
