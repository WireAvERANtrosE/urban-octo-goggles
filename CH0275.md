## Lucia and Nightingale
Lucia carefully placed three iron ingots on the floor of her bedroom, then closed her eyes, took a deep breath, and reviewed all of her past practice experiences in her mind before stretching out her hands and releasing her power to envelop the targets.

This was a training method Anna had come up with for her, and the iron ingots were also specially made by Anna—each of the three pig irons contained different components, with silver, copper, and lead melted into them, along with some impurities. What she had to do now was to reduce them back to pure elements while retaining the impurities and identify the ingot with the highest silver content.

This meant she had to control her magical output and only operate on the target once.

Otherwise, the impurities would be further dissociated—this was also why she felt she couldn't control her abilities back at her home in King's City. It was the same with paper; the final products were completely different because she hadn't understood the relationship between the magnitude of magical power and the effects of her abilities, which led to some papers being continuously broken down several times, eventually turning most of the raw materials into water and gas.

After coming to Border Town, the first lesson the witches taught her was to control her own magical power during practice.

Lucia didn't really believe that something intangible and invisible could be precisely controlled until Anna demonstrated measuring lengths with black fire right in front of her, and she realized how wrong she had been. Anna could even adjust the size and thickness of the black fire by regulating her magical output, and every time it was accurate to the smallest detail.

"Sister, are you practicing again?" Bell peeked out from the bed curiously, "We've just finished lunch."

Lucia's hand trembled, and one of the iron ingots instantly turned into several piles of powder.

"I've told you not to disturb me when I'm using my abilities," she turned her head and knocked on her sister's head, "Focus on your book!"



"I don't understand," Ring grumbled, "I don't know the meaning of half the words, and I'm not like my sister who can read and write."

"That's why you need to read more. Many words have similar structures, and even if you've never seen them before, you should be able to guess their meanings. Literacy itself is a process of familiarization."

"Alright." Ring withdrew her head.

Lucia refocused her attention on the second iron ingot, controlling the magical power to flow out slowly, imagining it in her mind as a layer of gauze, gently covering the target and wrapping it evenly.

"Hey, I'm here," the door suddenly creaked open, and a blond woman flashed into the room, "Oh, are you practicing your ability?"

"Sister Nightingale!" Ring let out a joyful cry.

The second iron ingot once again turned to powder.

Lucia sighed, gathering the metal fragments on the ground into a pouch. She felt that she might not be able to practice anymore this noon.

"Here, this is for you."



A cone of ice cream, exuding a rich milky fragrance, was handed to her.

"Thank you," Lucia took the ice cream, "But isn't this only distributed during afternoon tea?"

Nightingale patted her chest proudly, "This is a reward I specially requested from His Highness, and... you have a share too." She handed another cone to Ring, eliciting a burst of laughter from the little girl.

"Nightingale sister is the best to me!"

This girl, once she has something tasty, she forgets all about me, Lucia thought helplessly. However, the moment the ice cream entered her mouth, she felt that if she were the younger sister, her reaction would probably be the same as Ring's—The rich honey and milk flavors melted in her mouth, while the cold and refreshing texture blended the two together, amplifying the sweetness even further. Even after swallowing, it left a lingering coolness on the lips and teeth.

Nobody could resist its deliciousness, especially in the hot summer. No wonder His Highness only distributed ice cream during weekend afternoon tea; such a unique treat must be quite valuable, at least she had never heard of such a dessert back in Golden Wheat City.

With that thought, Lucia couldn't help but ask, "How did you ask His Highness for it?"

"Hehe," Nightingale's lips curled up, "I ranked third in this test, just behind Wendy and Leaf, but Roland His Highness thought I wouldn't pass. With such a big deviation from reality, naturally, I had to ask him for a reward."

"I see... so that's how it is," she hesitated for a moment, "Then, what about me?"



"Sixty-eight points, I'm not sure what rank that puts me in."

"Uh, that's pretty low," Lucia said dejectedly. With a total score of one hundred and twenty, she had only answered just over half correctly, and that was based on the fact that she could already read.

"It's not too bad," Nightingale patted her head, "considering you haven't been attending the classes for long, you're bound to be a bit behind in math and science. If there's anything you don't understand, you can always ask me."

"Can I ask too! Can I?" Wendy raised her hand.

"Of course," Nightingale smiled in response, "you're always welcome."

"When I pass the elementary assessment, does that mean I can choose my own job?"

"You're still too young for that. His Highness has said that the minimum age to start working is fourteen, and you're only ten. What's the rush?" Lucia glared at her.

The little girl retorted defiantly, "I just want to help alleviate your burden as soon as possible. Things like getting married and having children cost a lot of money, right? If we don't have enough, life can be very tough!"

"Who have you been listening to?" Lucia said, holding her forehead.



"Dad ah, he often complains that he's almost unable to provide for us," said Wendy.

"Pfft," Nightingale couldn't help but laugh, "If you could start working, where would you choose to go?"

"The chemistry lab!" Lightning raised her hand, "I want to become an alchemist, earn the title of a sage, and receive everyone's admiration and praise!"

"That's... not the best idea," she shook her head, "The lab is actually quite dangerous."

"Dangerous?" the sisters exclaimed in unison.

"Yes," Nightingale spread her hands, "Not only do you often have to deal with acids, but sometimes there are explosions, and even the Chief Alchemist Stu can't avoid accidents. Last time, he even lost four fingers. If it weren't for Nana, Mr. Kyle Sichi might have never been able to pick up those bottles and jars again." She paused, "And His Highness seems to be planning to develop a new kind of gunpowder lately; even he thinks it's extremely dangerous and insists on setting aside a separate lab for its production."

"Uh, in that case, do you have any good suggestions?" Lucia hugged Lightning, firmly deciding in her heart that she must not let her sister work in such a frightening place.

"Of course, it's to enter the City Hall and become a civil servant."

"Civil... servant?" she repeated.



"Cough cough, that's just what His Highness says to himself. Simply put, it means a city hall official," Nightingale coughed twice, "It's stable and safe, with above-average pay, but with good prospects. Once you become a department head, the rewards are no less than that of a witch."

"I see," Lucia said thoughtfully.

"Nightingale sister, do you like His Highness?" Sylvie clamored, "You say 'His Highness says' a lot in your words. Mom says you only talk that much about someone you really like."

Lucia's face stiffened at her sister's question. Damn it, how could you just ask something like that outright? It was simply too rude. Even with a regular friend, you couldn't just ask directly, let alone someone you respected as a senior. She hastily covered Sylvie's mouth, intending to apologize, but then she heard Nightingale answer frankly—

"Yes, I like him."
