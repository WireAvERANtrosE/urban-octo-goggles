## Artillery Battalion
After a week of curing in the maintenance room, the day finally arrived for the cement boat to be launched for outfitting.



The workers summoned were dumbfounded when the prince ordered them to push this hard-earned bathtub into the water, and everyone doubted if they had heard it wrong.



However, Roland's command was indeed so.



He had people temporarily dismantle the shed and then dug a ramp at the bottom of the cement boat, leading directly into the river. This part had to be done with extra care because the tensile and seismic resistance of cement products was very poor. A few cracks would be a minor issue, but if it were to hit the ground and shatter into pieces, all their efforts would have been in vain.



Rollers were placed, and ropes were tied to control the sliding speed. Once everything was ready, the workers wrapped the thick hemp ropes around newly driven stakes, pulling them taut in a straight line. Following the commands, they slowly loosened the ropes, and the bottom of the boat slid over the rollers with a piercing friction sound.



Fortunately, everything went smoothly. Roland saw the cement boat gradually fall into the river, with the boat drawing about half a meter of water, and about one meter of the hull still exposed above the surface. The workers were astonished to see that this thing, heavier than stone, did not sink into the river with a thud but floated on the surface like a leaf.



"Quick, wrap the ropes around the stakes a few more times, then tie it tight!" Roland commanded. The hemp ropes tied to the hull could not be untied yet, otherwise, the cement boat would drift southward with the river current.



Nightingale, although not revealing herself, expressed her shock unmistakably in her tone of disbelief: "Why can it float?"



"Uh... simply put, its average density is lower than that of water, so it can float on the surface," Roland pondered for a moment before answering, "As for whether it's made of iron or cement doesn't matter much. Actually, you should understand by looking at sailboats; such a large ship is much heavier than a stone."



The voice did not ring out again, and he guessed that the other party had fallen into deep thought. Even Anna might not be able to respond immediately. Roland smiled and continued to direct the workers for the next step of the work.



The subsequent outfitting was a long process. When it started to snow heavily, the work had to be stopped, and it was only when the snow was lighter that they could rush to work for a while. The main content of the outfitting was laying the deck. Planks with tongue and groove joints were installed onto the ship, and many short wooden stakes stood as supports between the deck and the ship's bottom. Although it wasted some space, considering the main use of the cement ship, it didn't matter much.



Next came the anti-corrosion treatment. The carpenters were quite clear on how to do this; they first brushed a layer of oil with a pungent odor onto the deck, and after it solidified, they applied several layers of red paint repeatedly. Once everything related to the deck was completed, the outfitting entered the stage of installing the superstructure.



The so-called superstructure was nothing more than a wooden shed standing between the two masts, used for storing cannons and ammunition. In case of rain, the sailors could also have a place to take shelter. A platform was also specially added to the top of the shed for one person to stand on, clearly intended for Wendy. As long as she stood on top of the shed, the range of her ability could cover all the sails above and below.



The ship's rudder, made of cast iron, was somewhat troublesome to install. It required the rudder handle to be passed through a pre-reserved hole underwater so that it protruded above the deck, and then a metal ring was fitted over it from the deck, to be welded and buckled. The buckle was a right-angled triangular iron plate, with the long side welded to the rudder handle, while the short side could freely rotate in the groove reserved in the metal ring.



The welding work was naturally left to Anna to complete. After similarly expressing shock and confusion about the stone bathtub that could float on water, she asked the same question as Nightingale had.



Roland repeated the answer, then saw Anna squatting down and falling into deep thought.



Hmm... The road to universal education is long and arduous.



...



On the other side, Tanner was hesitant about whether to join the Artillery Battalion or the Gun Battalion.

Everything started with an order from three days ago.

His Highness the Prince decided to reorganize a special team from the outstanding personnel in the First and Second Militia Teams, and Tanner was thrilled to hear his own name listed among them. However, when Iron Axe asked him whether he wanted to join the Artillery Battalion or the Gun Battalion, he was bewildered. He knew about guns; they were straightforward and effective against demonic beasts on the city walls, with a penetrating power much stronger than that of a hand crossbow. Currently, only Iron Axe, the Chief Knight, and a few hunters could wield such fierce weapons. Tanner should have joined the Gun Battalion without any hesitation, but he happened to ask an extra question, "What is a cannon?"

After learning that a cannon was a ten-fold larger gun, with a power a hundred times greater than that of a gun, he found himself in a dilemma.

Clearly, the ability to use a more powerful weapon proved His Highness the Prince valued him more, and joining the Artillery Battalion seemed to be a better choice than the Gun Battalion. However, walking through the streets of the town with that straight-barreled gun, attracting everyone's attention, was a scene he had always dreamed of. Although the cannon was powerful, after being enlarged ten times, it certainly couldn't be carried around, could it?

Until the last day of the deadline, he gritted his teeth and chose the Artillery Battalion. The last straw that broke the camel's back was the monthly salary, which was 5 Silver Royals higher than that of the Gun Battalion.

Then the rigorous training began.

Operating a cannon required five people, and those assigned to Tanner's group were Jop, Moe, Nelson, and Rodney. Tanner, due to his experience as the deputy leader of the Spear Battalion, was appointed as the gunner.

Compared to guns, this thing was more than ten times more troublesome to serve! For over a month, he had secretly observed Iron Axe operating the gun and thought he had mastered the process. But just transitioning the cannon from marching status to ready-to-fire status involved a complicated set of operations.



Halt the horse, pull out the pin, raise the hook, move the gun carriage, push it to the firing position, lower the supportsâ€”these procedures required the cooperation of five people. For instance, when raising the hook, the others needed to immediately push the cannon forward to separate the hook from the traction vehicle, changing from four wheels to two, before the supports could be lowered. The team had to work together seamlessly during the transition; otherwise, the heavy gun carriage would be difficult to remove from the traction vehicle.



After positioning was complete, the next step was to load the ammunition and prepare to fire. This part was quite similar to loading a musket, except that cleaning the barrel required using two brushes in turn, each inserted once. The gunpowder was also pre-packaged, ready to be loaded directly into the barrel. The firing method used a fuse, which Tanner thought would be difficult to use effectively in the rain.



Fortunately, the gunner's chief role was to command others on what to do, which didn't require too much physical effort.



In the beginning three days, the four selected artillery teams had only one cannon available for training. Thus, under Iron Axe's command, a group of people loaded the gun carriage onto the vehicle, unloaded it, prepared for firing, and then reversed the process to load it back onto the vehicle. These two steps were repeated over and over, and Tanner suspected that the gun barrel, constantly being cleaned, was probably much cleaner than his own face.
