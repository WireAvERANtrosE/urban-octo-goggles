## Stone Tower
Lightning soared above the Misty Forest.

To her, the world seemed to have shrunk. The details disappeared from her vision, leaving only patches of color. Brown was the earth, gray the mountains, green the forests, and blue the rivers.

And green took up the majority of her view.

Different from the bright, vivid green of the fields around Border Town, the green here was mixed with gray and black, deep and thick. No matter whether she looked west or north, there was no end to this dark green expanse. If she looked too long, she would feel as though she was falling, and Lightning had to look up at the sky from time to time to dispel the growing sense of confinement.

Behind her, the grey clouds hung low, obscuring the peaks of the Impassable Mountain Range and shrouding Border Town in rain and mist.

She was now searching for relics from 450 years ago within the Misty Forest, undoubtedly a grand adventure. Half a month ago, when she heard the task Roland had entrusted to her, Lightning immediately agreed with a pat on her chest. Unlike the snake witch Cara, who clung to her ancient books, Prince Roland repeatedly stressed that the map was for reference only and reminded her to pay attention to safety, saying it was alright if she couldn't find it. This made the young girl very happy.

She knew that the prince was absolutely right: even a castle, after more than four hundred years, could be swallowed by the encroaching vegetation and gradually turn into a pile of dust. Yet, she still wanted to find this place—if she could determine the position of the hexagram, it would be the same as confirming the direction of the Holy City of Taquila. Having understood the whole story, Lightning naturally knew what Taquila meant.

There, she might help Prince Roland discover the true reason behind the war that the Church had waged against the devils, hidden from sight.

This was far more thrilling than exploring shipping routes with her father!



Lightning meticulously drew a grid of equidistant squares on a square piece of parchment, following the method of charting sea maps. Then, based on the distance she flew over a certain period, she roughly estimated the contents to fill in the squares. Once the grid was filled, she would have effectively searched the area.



Now, she had filled in half of it.



The rain clouds behind her were approaching faster than Lightning had imagined; the little girl could even faintly hear the thunder rolling within the clouds. She lowered her altitude, skimming over the forest below.



Just then, a flash of greyish-white caught the corner of her eye.



She hesitated for a moment, stopped in her tracks, and hovered in midair, looking back over the area she had just passed.



She found nothing.



Was it an illusion? Lightning thought for a moment and decided to fly over the area again.



This time, she flew even lower. The forest was no longer a solid block of green. The mottled tree trunks, the forked branches, and leaves of various shapes... The details stood out from the swathes of color, coming back into Lightning's view.



Dozens of breaths later, she suddenly saw a small section of a white stone tower beneath the layers of branches. The top of the tower had been completely sheared off, causing it to be obscured by the forest and difficult to spot from the sky. Had she not been trying to avoid the rain clouds, she might have missed it entirely.



Lightning's heart pounded violently—could this be the location of the ruins indicated on the map?



She circled the stone tower once, finding nothing out of the ordinary, and decided to get closer for a better look.



It was only after landing that the young girl realized it was not quite right to call it a white stone tower.



Its surface was covered in vines and moss, turning it a grayish-green color when seen up close. The tower leaned slightly, as if it had been struck by some immense force, and there were scattered stone blocks around it, similar in material and color to the tower itself, likely from a shattered top. Larger pieces still bore traces, while smaller ones were probably buried beneath weeds and soil. The stone tower was quite massive; its base area was comparable to Prince Roland's castle. Such man-made structures usually had basements.



By all rights, she should have recorded the location of the ruins and then returned to Border Town.



Every adventure story in her mind warned her that entering an ancient ruin that had slumbered for hundreds of years alone was not a good idea. Just the stale air trapped underground could be lethal.



But Lightning found she couldn't move away; her curiosity nagged at her: Just take a look, only a quick glance. She looked up at the sky, which had been fairly clear but was now overcast and gloomy. Clearly, a heavy rain was about to fall.



Well then, she told herself, flying in the rain would be very uncomfortable, so she might as well take shelter in the tower and sneak a peek inside. If she found a basement, she definitely wouldn't go in alone.



Having made up her mind, Lightning yielded to the curiosity she could no longer contain, walked to the vine-covered entrance, drew a small knife from her waist, and cleared a small hole just big enough for her to pass through. The wooden door had long since rotted away, and she easily entered the tower.



Since the top was lifted off, the interior was very clear without the need for torches. Lightning circled around the base of the tower but didn't discover anything. It was evident that time had erased any exposed objects and traces, leaving behind nothing but the broken walls on the ground. She also found holes that ascended the wall, which were likely meant for stairs, but the stairs themselves had vanished.



The entrance to the basement was conspicuous, located in the southwest direction of the first floor, directly opposite the entrance to the stone tower. Lightning suspected that if one were to head towards the Barbarian Land in this direction, they would find the Holy City of Taquila mentioned in the ancient texts.



Just then, fine rain began to fall from the sky, landing on Lightning's nose. She slowly walked into the passage that led underground, turning a corner to find a wooden door in front of her. Although it was not completely rotted away, it looked very fragile and would fall apart at the slightest touch.



Soon, the light rain turned into a downpour, with the sound of raindrops hitting the ground merging into a continuous din, from disorderly to inseparable. Although she wouldn't get wet in this spot, the water quickly started to flow down the stone steps. To avoid getting her shoes wet, Lightning lifted her feet off the ground and slowly floated up.



Suddenly, she faintly heard a shout, mixed within the sound of the rain, almost indiscernible.



This sound instantly made her hairs stand on end, and the little girl panicked, looking around the narrow passage, where there was nothing but a few scattered withered vines. Using the faint light coming from outside, she opened her waist pouch, took out a portable torch and flint, and tried to light it to take a closer look.



At that moment, the shout came again, this time seemingly from the wooden door behind her. Lightning couldn't help but shiver and quickly turned around. The torch slipped from her hand, falling to the ground and splashing water.



This time the voice seemed much clearer, and she could vaguely make out that it was a woman's voice.



Someone in the basement? This thought made a cold sweat break out on her back. How could that be possible! The stone tower was supposed to be a relic left over from over four hundred years ago and located deep within the Hidden Forest. Besides herself, who else could have reached this place?



"Save me..."

By the time the third plea sounded, it was very clear—the voice indeed came from behind the wooden door, sounding as if it were calling for help. Lightning swallowed hard and carefully placed her hand on the door, giving it a gentle push. The damp and slippery wooden door toppled backwards, crashing onto the ground with a muffled thud.



A tall figure suddenly appeared before her!



Lightning felt as if all the blood in her body had turned to ice. The figure's appearance was exactly like the devil depicted in Soraya's paintings! Under the dim light, it seemed as if the devil was also staring at her, its huge body slightly leaning forward, holding an axe in its hand with only three fingers. The axe reflected dark red bloodstains. In an instant, bloody images of these brutal thugs killing the sisters of the Witch Cooperation Association flooded her mind.



"Ah—!" She let out a scream of terror, hurling the flint in her hand at the figure and turning to flee down the tunnel at top speed, flying into the rain and escaping in the direction of Border Town.



Lightning did not notice that when the flint struck the devil's chest, it made a crisp impact sound. A fine crack appeared where it hit, and it quickly spread throughout, until it covered the entire body. The devil's figure collapsed and shattered amidst these growing cracks, turning into wisps of white dust that dissipated with the wind.
