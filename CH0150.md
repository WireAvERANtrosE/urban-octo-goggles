## Stone Tower
Lightning soared above the Hidden Forest.

To her, the world seemed to have shrunk. Wherever her sight reached, details faded away, leaving behind patches of color. Brown was the earth, gray the mountains, green the forests, and blue the rivers.

And green took up the vast majority of her view.

Unlike the bright, vibrant green of the farmland around Border Town, the green here was mixed with gray and black, deep and thick. Whether looking west or north, the dark green expanse seemed endless. Staring too long could induce a feeling of falling, forcing Lightning to look up at the sky every so often to dispel the growing sense of confinement.

Behind her, the low-hanging, murky clouds obscured the peaks of the Impassable Mountain Range, shrouding Border Town in a mist of rain.

She was now searching for a relic from 450 years ago within the Hidden Forest, an undoubtedly grand adventure. When she heard the task assigned to her by Roland half a month ago, Lightning immediately agreed with a thump of her chest. Unlike the Snake Witch Cara, who clung to ancient tomes, His Highness Prince Roland repeatedly emphasized that the map was for reference only and insisted on the importance of safety, assuring her that it was fine if she couldn't find it. This made the young girl very happy.

She knew Prince Roland was absolutely right; even a castle, after more than four hundred years, would be devoured by the rampant growth of plants and gradually turn into a pile of dust. Yet she still wanted to find this place—identifying the position of the hexagram was the same as confirming the direction of the Holy City of Taquila. Having heard the whole story, Lightning naturally understood what Taquila meant.

There, she might help His Highness the Prince uncover the true reasons behind the church's concealed war with the devils.

This was far more thrilling than exploring new routes with her father!



Lightning followed the method of charting sea maps, filling a square piece of parchment with equally spaced grids, and then, based on the distance she flew over a period of time, she estimated the content to fill in the grids. Once the grids were filled, the area would be more or less thoroughly searched.

Now, she had filled in half of it.

The approaching speed of the rain clouds behind her was faster than Lightning had imagined, and the little girl could even faintly hear the thunder rolling within the clouds. She lowered her altitude and skimmed towards the forest below.

Just then, a flash of gray-white shadow passed by the corner of her eye.

She paused, stopped in her tracks, and hovered in the air, turning her head to scan the area she had just passed.

She found nothing.

Was it an illusion? Lightning thought for a moment and decided to fly over the area again.

This time, she lowered her altitude even further. The forest was no longer a solid block of green; the mottled trunks, the forked branches, the leaves of various shapes... Details started to stand out from the masses of color, coming into Lightning's view once again.

Dozens of breaths later, she suddenly saw a small half of a white stone tower beneath the layers of branches. The top of the stone tower had been completely sheared off, causing the body of the tower to be concealed by the forest, making it difficult to spot from the sky. Had it not been for the need to avoid the rain clouds, she might have missed it completely.



Lightning's heart pounded fiercely. Could this be the location of the ruins indicated on the map?

She circled the stone tower but found nothing unusual, so she decided to get a closer look.

It was only after landing that the girl realized it was somewhat improper to call it a white stone tower.

Its surface was covered with vines and moss, and upon closer inspection, it had turned a gray-green color. The tower was slightly tilted, as if struck by some immense force, and there were scattered stones around it, similar in material and color to the tower itself, likely from the shattered top. The larger pieces still showed traces, while the smaller ones were probably buried under weeds and soil. The stone tower was colossal, its base area comparable to Prince Roland's castle. Such man-made structures usually had basements.

At this point, she should have recorded the location of the ruins and returned to Border Town.

The various adventure stories in her head also reminded her that it was not a good choice to venture alone into a relic that had been dormant for hundreds of years. Just the decayed gas sealed underground could prove fatal.

But Lightning found she couldn't move her feet, her curiosity incessantly nagging at her: Just take a look, one quick look. She looked up at the sky, which had been fairly clear but now had turned gloomy and dark, a clear sign that a heavy rain was coming.

That settled it, she told herself. Flying in the rain would be uncomfortable, so why not take shelter in the tower and take a quick look while at it. If she found a basement, she would definitely not go in alone.

After finishing her thought process, Lightning gave in to her overwhelming curiosity. She walked to the entrance, thick with vines, pulled out a small knife from her waist, and cleared a small hole to crawl through. The wooden door had long since rotted away, and she entered the tower with ease.



Because the top had been torn off, the inside was very clear without the need for a torch. Lightning circled the bottom of the tower but didn't find anything. It was evident that time had erased any exposed items and traces, leaving nothing but broken partitions on the ground. She also found holes on the walls that gradually ascended, likely meant for stairs, but the stairs themselves had disappeared.



The entrance to the basement was conspicuous, located in the southwest direction of the first floor, right opposite the stone tower entrance. Lightning suspected that if she proceeded in this direction towards the wilderness, she would find the holy city of Taquila mentioned in the ancient books.



At that moment, fine rain began to fall from the sky, landing on Lightning's nose. She slowly walked into the passageway that stretched underground, turned a corner, and a wooden door appeared in front of her. Although it was not completely decayed, it looked so dilapidated that it would fall apart at a light touch.



Soon, the drizzle turned into a downpour, and the pitter-patter of raindrops hitting the ground merged into an undistinguishable sound. Although she couldn't get wet in this place, the accumulated water quickly began to flow down the stone steps. To avoid getting her shoes wet, Lightning let her feet off the ground and slowly floated up.



Suddenly, she faintly heard a shout mixed within the sound of the rain, almost indiscernible.



The sound immediately made her hair stand on end, and the little girl frantically looked around. The narrow passageway had nothing but a few scattered withered vines. Borrowing the weak light seeping in from outside, she opened her waist bag, took out a portable torch and flint, intending to light it to take a closer look.



At that moment, the shout rang out again, this time it seemed to come from the wooden door behind her. Lightning couldn't help but shiver and quickly turned around. The torch slipped from her hand, falling to the ground and splashing up water.



This time the voice seemed much clearer, and she could vaguely make out that it was a woman's voice.



Someone in the basement? The thought made her break out into a cold sweat. How was that possible? The stone tower was supposed to be a relic left from over four hundred years ago, located deep within the Hidden Forest. Besides herself, who else could have reached this place?



"Save me..."

When the third cry sounded, it was already very clear—the voice indeed came from behind the wooden door, sounding like a plea for help. Lightning swallowed hard and cautiously placed her hand on the door, giving it a gentle push. The moist and greasy door fell backward, hitting the ground with a dull thud.



A tall figure suddenly appeared in front of her!



Lightning felt as if all the blood in her body had frozen. The figure was the spitting image of the devil depicted in Soraya's paintings! In the dim light, it seemed as if the devil was also watching her, its huge body leaning slightly forward, with a large hand that had only three fingers clutching an axe. The blade of the axe reflected dark red bloodstains. In an instant, bloody images of these brutal fiends slaughtering the sisters of the Mutual Aid Society flooded her mind.



"Ah—!" She let out a terrified scream, hurling the flint in her hand at the figure and spinning around to dash out of the passage at full speed, flying straight into the rain, fleeing towards Border Town.



Lightning did not notice that when the piece of flint struck the devil's chest, it made a crisp impact sound. A circle of fine cracks appeared at the point of impact, which then quickly spread throughout its body. The devil's form collapsed and shattered amongst these ever-increasing fractures, turning into wisps of white dust that dissipated with the wind.
