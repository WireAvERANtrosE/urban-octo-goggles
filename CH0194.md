## Lily
Not long after the prince returned to his office, Scroll followed him in.



"Your Highness, I apologize for Lily... She didn't mean to," Scroll said with a sigh.



"I don't mind," he replied with a smile, "she's just a little girl after all."



"Only you could be so forgiving towards us," Scroll sighed, "She wasn't like this from the start, it's just that after being deceived, she finds it hard now to trust ordinary people."



"Is it about something that happened before she joined the Witch Union?" he inquired, "I recall she's only been with you for a year."



"That's correct. I found her on the outskirts of Redwater City," Scroll explained, "You know, I can sense the presence of magic power. The closer I am, the stronger the sensation. Though I can't see the shape and color of the magic directly like Nightingale can, it at least allows me to discover new witches. So, whenever we passed through a town, I would disguise myself as a noble lady wanting to adopt a child, and visit the local shelters or orphanages to look for sisters who might have awakened." She paused for a moment, "At that time, Lily was locked up in a remote town's shelter. But when I specifically asked to adopt her, I was refused. The owner of the shelter told me that they only sold adult girls."



"Why?" Roland wondered. A witch's awakening happens before adulthood, could it be related?



"We also found it very strange at the time, so we had Nightingale infiltrate the shelter to look for ledgers, records, and any related information. Fortunately, the shelter was far enough from the town, so we could stay in the area for a longer period."



"Why didn't you just take Lily away? With Nightingale's help, it shouldn't have been difficult, right?"



"Indeed, it's not difficult," Scroll nodded. "Other than a God's Stone of Retaliation worn by the manager, there are no other stones or mechanisms placed inside the shelter. But we cannot do this; there has been a precedent for such matters."

"What precedent?" Prince Roland made tea for Scroll.

"Thank you," she accepted the teacup, "At first, when we discovered a witch, we would forcibly take her away. However, an incident that happened in Seawindshire changed our approach. A young witch who had just awakened thought we were the evil ones. After being brought back to the Witch Cooperation Association, she attacked us without listening to explanations. In the end, two of our sisters were fatally injured, and she herself was killed by Cara's 'Executioner' magic snake. Since then, we would carefully observe a witch for a period of time, confirming her situation and thoughts before taking action. If the church pursues too closely, we... can only choose to give up."

"So, Nightingale's encounter with Wendy was not a coincidence?"

"Of course not," Scroll took a sip of tea and smiled, shaking her head. "It took over a month from the time we discovered Nightingale's existence until Wendy made contact with her. During that period, we also recruited other sisters, like Redpepper and Purswind..." Her expression dimmed as she spoke, "It's a pity they all perished in the Fertile Plains. If everyone had chosen to settle in Border Town from the beginning, how good that would have been."

Roland also felt quite regretful. If the Witch Cooperation Association's forty-plus witches had all gathered in the town, it probably would have already entered a modernized life.

"Let's not talk about that," Scroll took a deep breath, "Let's talk about Lily's matter. After investigating the shelter and tracking the owner's movements, we discovered an astonishing fact — this small rural mansion was neither a real shelter nor established for selecting witches."

"For what then?"

"To satisfy the manager's personal desires." Even someone as composed as Scroll looked somewhat grim as she said this, "The manager would go to the slums of Redwater City every week, abducting those homeless girls, and deceiving them by saying that he was a kind noble who had opened a shelter in the suburbs. There, great nobles would often visit in disguise to choose adopted daughters, and if one was selected, they would not have to worry about food and clothing for life. Not everyone would be deceived, but... over the course of a decade or so, hundreds of girls have gone to the shelter one after another."



"So many?" Roland frowned. "But you said the shelter wasn't large."



"Only a few hundred are recorded in the ledger, most of them are... dead," she whispered, "Over the course of a dozen years, he found a total of three witches, and sold them all to the church. If the other girls were good-looking, he would dress them up and sell them to those in need. Those who nobody cared about were killed in the woods of the shelter."



"..." The prince didn't know what to say for a moment. Suddenly, he felt a pair of hands gently rest on his shoulders.



"The chance of a witch's awakening is not high, so excluding the cost of upkeep for the shelter, he earned around twenty Gold royals over the years, according to the records in the ledger. But for these twenty Gold royals, nearly three hundred people died, and the pits in the forest were filled with bodies. When Cara interrogated him about why he did such things, he actually said that earning Gold royals was not his intention, it was merely to maintain the operation of the shelter, and that he only sold adult women for this reason—a witch could be sold for much more than an ordinary woman. His purpose was to enjoy the thrill of having the power of life and death, disposing of the lives of these wandering girls at will made him feel like a king. Cara, in a fit of rage, killed him, and when we wanted to disperse the group of girls, most of them glared at us with anger, as if we had stolen their chance to be adopted by nobles."



"Lily was the same at first, until Cara took her to the woods behind the small building. There, she saw her friend—the 'lucky' girl who claimed to have been chosen by a noble and left the shelter a month ago—as well as several stinking pits. After that, Lily vomited uncontrollably and fainted in Cara's arms. When she woke up, she was also expressionless, her eyes devoid of any luster, until later, under Wendy's care, she slowly recovered. Since then, she has been very wary and distrustful of ordinary people, especially nobles," Scroll said. "But I believe she will gradually correct this view, after all, you are also a member of the nobility."



"I see." Roland sighed inwardly. To be able to pick herself up after such an ordeal was a sign of great resilience.



Scroll picked up the kettle and refilled their cups, then remained silent for a long time before speaking again, "Your Highness, I have a question I want to ask you."



"What is it?" He was startled, noticing Scroll had a serious expression.



"Nightingale, you're here too, aren't you?"



"Uh," Nightingale materialized, "Do you need me to leave?"

"No... You already know about this anyway," she shook her head, "Consider it as accompanying me to bear witness."

Having said that, Scroll turned her gaze towards Prince Roland, "Your Highness, you once said that you are willing to marry a witch, but I am not sure if you are aware that witches cannot bear children." She paused for a moment, then asked word for word, "Your Highness, even so, will you still not change your original intention?"
