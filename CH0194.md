## Lily
Not long after the prince returned to his office, Scroll followed him in.

"Your Highness, I apologize for Lily's behavior... She didn't do it on purpose."

"I don't mind," he said with a smile, "she's just a little girl."

"Only you could be so tolerant towards us," Scroll sighed, "she wasn't always like this, it's just that after being deceived, she finds it hard to trust ordinary people now."

"Is it something that happened before she joined the Mutual Aid Society?" he asked, "I remember that she joined you only a year ago."

"Indeed, I found her on the outskirts of Redwater City," Scroll explained, "You know, I can sense the presence of magic. The closer I am, the stronger the sensation. Although I can't see magic's shape and color directly like Nightingale can, it at least allows me to find new witches. So every time I pass through a town, I disguise myself as a noble lady who wants to adopt a child, go to the local shelter or orphanage to see if there are any sisters who might have awakened." She paused for a moment, "At that time, Lily was confined in a remote town's shelter, but when I specifically asked to adopt her, I was refused. The owner of the shelter told me that they only sold grown girls."

"Why?" Roland wondered. Witches' latest awakening was before adulthood, could it be related to this?

"We also found it very strange at the time, so we had Nightingale infiltrate the shelter to search for ledgers, records, and related information. Fortunately, the shelter was far from the town, so we could stay there for a longer time."

"Why didn't you just take Lily away? With Nightingale's help, it shouldn't have been difficult, right?"



"Indeed, it's not difficult," Scroll nodded. "Other than the Divine Stone of Judgement worn by the manager, there are no other stones or mechanisms placed in the orphanage. But we cannot do this; there has been a precedent for such matters."

"What precedent?" the prince asked as he brewed tea for Scroll.

"Thank you," she said, taking the teacup. "Initially, whenever we discovered a witch, we would forcibly take her away. However, an incident in Fjords changed our approach. At that time, a young witch who had just awakened thought of us as the evil ones. After being brought back to the Witch Cooperation Association, she launched an attack on us without listening to explanations, resulting in the death of two sisters from severe injuries, and she herself was killed by Cara's 'Death Sentence' serpent. Since then, we have been carefully observing witches for a while, determining their situations and thoughts before taking action. If the church pursues too closely, we... can only choose to give up."

"So, Nightingale's encounter with Wendy wasn't accidental?"

"Of course not," Scroll sipped her tea and shook her head with a smile. "From the discovery of Nightingale's existence to Wendy's contact with her, it took over a month. During that time, we also recruited other sisters, like Redpepper and Pursuit...," her expression dimmed, "Unfortunately, they were buried in the wasteland. It would have been so much better if everyone had chosen to settle in Border Town from the start."

Roland also felt quite regretful. If the Witch Cooperation Association's forty-odd witches had all gathered in the town, it might have already entered modern life.

"Let's not talk about that," Scroll took a deep breath. "Let's talk about Lily's situation. After searching the orphanage and tracking the owner's movements, we discovered a startling fact—this small country house, not very large in scale, is neither a real orphanage nor established for the selection of witches."

"Then what is it for?"

"To satisfy the manager's personal desires." Even someone as well-composed as Scroll looked somewhat grim as she spoke, "The manager would go to the slums of Redwater City every week, abducting those homeless girls and deceiving them by saying that he was a kind-hearted noble who had opened an orphanage in the suburbs. There, it was common for high nobles to come in disguise to pick adopted daughters, and once chosen, they would no longer have to worry about food and clothing for the rest of their lives. Not everyone would be deceived, but... over the decade, hundreds of girls have gone to the orphanage one after another."



"So many?" Roland frowned. "But you said the shelter was not large."

"Hundreds are just recorded in the ledger; most of them... have died," she spoke softly, "In the span of more than a decade, he found three witches and sold them all to the Church. If the other girls were good-looking, he would dress them up and sell them to those in need. Those who no one cared about were killed in the woods of the shelter."

"..." The prince didn't know what to say for a moment. Suddenly, he felt a pair of hands gently rest on his shoulders from behind.

"The awakening rate for witches is not high, so aside from the cost of maintenance, the Gold royals he earned over the years amount to about twenty, according to the ledger. But for these twenty Gold royals, nearly three hundred people have died, and the pits in the forest are filled with bodies. When Cara interrogated him about why he did this, he actually said that earning Gold royals was not his intention, it was merely to maintain the operation of the shelter, and he only sold adult women for this reason—a witch can be sold for a much higher price than an ordinary woman. His purpose was to enjoy the thrill of having power over life and death, to dispose of the lives of these wandering girls at will, which made him feel like a king. Cara killed him in a fit of rage, and when we tried to disband this group of girls, most of them glared at us angrily, as if we had taken away their chance to be adopted by the nobility."

"Lily was the same at first, until Cara took her to the woods behind the mansion, where she saw her friend—the 'lucky' girl who lied about being chosen by a nobleman and left the shelter a month earlier—as well as several stinking pits. After that, Lily vomited violently and fainted in Cara's arms. When she woke up, her expression was blank, her eyes devoid of any sparkle, until later, under Wendy's care, she gradually recovered. Since then, she has been wary and distrustful of ordinary people, especially nobles," Scroll said. "But I believe she will gradually correct this view. After all, you are also a member of the nobility."

"I see." Roland sighed inwardly. To be able to pull oneself together after such an experience was a sign of great resilience.

Scroll picked up the kettle and refilled both their cups. After a long silence, she finally spoke, "Your Highness, I have a question for you."

"What is it?" He was taken aback, noticing that Scroll's expression was somewhat serious.

"Nightingale, you're here too, right?"



"Uh," Nightingale appeared, "Do you want me to leave?"

"No... You already know about this anyway," she shook her head, "Consider it as accompanying me to bear witness."

After speaking, Scroll turned her gaze to Prince Roland, "You once said that you were willing to marry a witch, but I am not sure if you are aware that witches cannot bear children." She paused for a moment, and asked word by word, "Your Highness, even so, will you still not change your original intention?"
