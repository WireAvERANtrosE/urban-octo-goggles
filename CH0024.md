## Development Plan
When Roland woke up in the morning, it wasn't Tyra who was serving him, but an older maid.
As he stepped out of the bedroom, the chief knight Carter was waiting for him outside the door.
"Your Highness, I have to inform you of unfortunate news," he said gravely, "Your chief maid died last night."
"What?" Roland's eyelids twitched, although he was already aware of the outcome, he still felt a little uncomfortable. After all, this person died because of him.
"She fell from the balcony of her room, there were no signs of a struggle at the scene, and the guards did not see any outsiders entering or leaving. So... it should be that she fell accidentally, it was an accident."
The knight reported the investigation results, while looking at Roland with a somewhat strange look. Roland certainly knew what he was thinking, back in Greycastle, it was well known that the fourth prince had tried to force himself onto Tyra multiple times. In this era, it was all too normal for princes to have relations with their maids, there were few entertainment activities, almost no nightlife, and naturally, after eating a full meal with nothing to do, they would think about procreation. Not only did they do it themselves, princes and upper-class nobles would even exchange women and even gather together to throw procreation parties, so the saying "what a messy circle" was not a simple joke.
The fourth prince was relatively restrained in this regard, and after becoming Roland, he hadn't even touched a woman - except for Tyra, the other maids were of a rather low standard. Coupled with the fact that after crossing over, he had to face the Evil Months, his mind was almost entirely filled with farming plans, he didn't even have time to enjoy the life of nobility.
"What a pity," Roland put on a regretful look, "Leave Tyra's funeral arrangements to the older maid who served me this morning. She is the new head maid now."
Carter nodded, saluted, and left.

Roland had just stepped into his office when he saw Nightingale sitting on the mahogany desk.
"Did you find out anything?"
"Nothing, she committed suicide as soon as she saw me." There was a hint of disappointment in her voice. "It was too quick, not a moment of hesitation."
"You didn't manage to restrain her?" Roland bypassed her and sat back down in his armchair.
"I tied her up," Nightingale leaned in closer, propping herself up at an angle. "Who would have thought she had poison hidden in her teeth. I had to make it look like an accidental fall."
"And you call yourself experienced? You still have the nerve to accept payment?"
"Hey, don't be like that. Just because I didn't get anything from her doesn't mean I came back empty-handed." Nightingale chuckled lightly and placed a folded piece of paper in front of Roland. "I found this in her room."
Roland unfolded the paper. It was a letter from home. The sender addressed Tyra as 'sister' and the content was just ordinary chit-chat. However, he noticed that the sender mentioned the sea multiple times, describing how beautiful the seaside scenery was and how much they enjoyed watching the sunset on the beach. The letter ended with a question asking when the sister would return home, saying they missed her dearly. Considering the territories of the siblings, Roland speculated uncertainly, "The third princess from Clearwater Harbor?"
"That's probably it. Your two brothers don't have a view of the sea. I suspect that the third princess, Grace Wimbledon, is holding her sister hostage, using her as a hidden pawn. Judging by her decisive suicide, it's unlikely that she was placed randomly. In other words, she must have undergone two to three years of relevant training before being planted by your side."

Roland sighed softly, indeed, the Battle of Divine Will was not going to end so easily. Even if he did not compete, it didn't mean he could stay out of it. For the throne, his brothers and sisters had no scruples. Similar incidents might happen again in the future.
“Ah, someone is coming. I'll take my leave first, Your Highness.”
Nightingale provocatively blew a breath towards Roland, then vanished into thin air in the blink of an eye.
Although it wasn’t the first time he had seen it, playing such a trick in broad daylight still startled Roland. He hesitated and reached out towards the empty space at the table edge, but his hand was intercepted halfway by a soft touch, “Your Highness, doing this might make Anna sad.”
Alright, it seemed her ability was invisibility, not disappearing, Roland thought, otherwise it would be too terrifying.
There was a knock at the door, “Your Highness, it's Barov.”
Roland withdrew his hand, returning to his emotionless expression, “Come in.”
The minister's assistant walked into the office with a large bundle of documents, and began to report the political situation of the past week before he even sat down. Roland also put his thoughts away and listened attentively to his report. After more than a month of immersion, he found himself able to keep up with the others rhythm, instead of the initial confusion, completely clueless.
Overall, Border Town's finances had improved to a certain extent, mainly due to selling ores and uncut gems to Willow Town, which had earned nearly two hundred Gold Royals. After using this money to buy food and pay wages, there was still ninety left.

Barov was in high spirits, with extra money in hand, getting through this winter wouldn't be too difficult. However, Roland was not going to let him rest, "I'm going to select a group of people from the civilians to fight against the demonic beasts. They must start training immediately. The instructor will be my Chief Knight, and I'll discuss the details with him. You need to put together a purchasing plan. This group needs sturdy leather armor, long spears, and two sets of winter clothes each."

"Your Highness, isn't it customary to temporarily conscript the civilians for war?" 

"An untrained force is merely a rabble. Do you think sheer numbers can scare off the demonic beasts? It would be more troublesome if they panicked and scattered."

"Do you really plan to hold Border Town to the death?" Barov asked hesitantly.

"Of course, if we can't hold on, we will retreat. However, I don't believe we can't even handle a few mutated beasts."

"Your plan will require additional funds."

Roland laughed at Barov's miserly demeanor, "These are necessary expenses, go make it happen."

He still had over three hundred Gold royals in his treasury, mainly for building the city walls. He also paid out of his own pocket for the materials and parts needed to order the steam engine from the blacksmith shop. The first one cost nearly twenty Gold royals, and he needed at least three more.

There's no denying that the steam engine propelled the first Industrial Revolution, but that doesn't mean the steam engine equates to the Industrial Revolution. In history, England precisely developed to the point of needing a new type of power to replace humans and livestock, to satisfy production in the mining areas. After Watt improved the steam engine, he immediately received a massive number of orders, and this new power also spread to all industries in a very short time.

At this point, Border Town had no foundation for the Industrial Revolution, one could even say that industry didn't exist at all. Therefore, Roland didn't expect to earn his first pot of gold by selling steam engines. He only wanted to put this machine into use in the North Mine Mountain for hauling ores and crushing rocks. After the output of the mines increased, he would then expand the scale of the steam engine's usage, effectively promoting industrial development from top to bottom.
