## Development Plan
When Roland woke up in the morning, it was not Tyra who attended to him, but an older maid.

As he came out of the bedroom, the Chief Knight, Carter, was waiting for him outside the door.

"Your Highness, I have some unfortunate news to tell you," he said gravely, "Your head maid died last night."

"What?" Roland's eyelids twitched. Although he had already anticipated this outcome, he still felt somewhat uncomfortable. After all, she had died because of him.

"She fell from the balcony of her room. There were no signs of struggle at the scene, and the guards did not see any outsiders entering or leaving. So... it must have been an accidental fall."

The knight reported the investigation results, while his gaze towards Roland was somewhat strange. Of course, Roland knew what he was thinking. Back in King's City, it was common knowledge that the Fourth Prince had tried several times to force himself on Tyra. In this era, it was perfectly normal for princes and their maids to have relations. Entertainment was scarce, and there was practically no nightlife, so after a full meal with nothing else to do, it was natural to think about procreation. Not only did they procreate themselves, but princes and nobles also exchanged women and even gathered to host procreation parties, so the saying that 'the circle is truly messy' was not just a jest.

The Fourth Prince had been relatively restrained in this regard, and after becoming Roland, he hadn't touched a woman at all—except for Tyra, the rest of the maids were quite mediocre. Furthermore, after transmigrating, he had to face the Evil Months, and his mind was almost entirely filled with plans for development; he hadn't had time to enjoy the pleasures of noble life.

"It truly is a pity," Roland said with a feigned expression of regret, "Leave Tyra's funeral arrangements to the older maid who attended to me this morning. She is the new head maid now."

Carter nodded, saluted, and left.



Upon entering his office, Roland immediately saw Nightingale sitting on the mahogany desk.

"Did you find out anything?"

"Nothing at all. She killed herself the moment she saw me," her tone was somewhat dejected, "It was too quick, without the slightest hesitation."

"You didn't manage to restrain her?" Roland walked past her and sat back in his armchair.

"I did tie her up," Nightingale leaned in, propping herself up, "Who would have thought she had poison hidden in her teeth. I had no choice but to stage it as an accidental fall."

"I thought you were experienced. You still have the nerve to ask for payment after this?"

"Hey, don't say that. Even though I didn't get anything from her mouth, it doesn't mean I came back empty-handed," Nightingale chuckled lightly and placed a folded piece of paper in front of Roland, "Found in her room."

Roland unfolded the paper; it was a family letter. The sender addressed Tyra as her sister, and the content was just ordinary chit-chat. However, he noticed that the sender mentioned the sea multiple times, such as how beautiful the seaside scenery was and how she loved to stay on the beach to watch the sunset. At the end of the letter, the sender asked when her sister could come back, saying she missed her very much. Considering the territories of the siblings, Roland said uncertainly, "The Third Princess in Clearwater Harbor?"

"It's probably something like that, neither of your brothers can see the sea. From what I surmise, the Third Princess Grace Wimbledon is holding her younger sister as a hostage, using her as a hidden pawn. Given her resolute manner of suicide, it’s unlikely she was placed there on a whim. This means, before being planted by your side, she had at least two to three years of relevant training."



Roland let out a soft sigh; as expected, the battle for the throne would not end so easily. Even if he did not compete for it, it did not mean he could stay out of the fray. In pursuit of the throne, his brothers and sisters had no scruples, and similar incidents were likely to happen again in the future.



"Ah, someone's coming. I will take my leave now, Your Highness."



Nightingale teased Roland with a breath, then vanished into thin air in the blink of an eye.



Even though it wasn't the first time he had seen her do this, such a trick in broad daylight still startled Roland. He hesitated for a moment, then reached out tentatively towards the now-empty space at the table, only to have his finger met by a soft hand that stopped him halfway, "Your Highness, doing this might make Anna sad."



Alright, it seems her ability is to turn invisible, not to disappear, Roland thought, otherwise that would be too terrifying.



There was a knock on the door, "Your Highness, it's Barov."



Roland withdrew his hand and returned to his impassive demeanor, "Come in."



The Assistant Minister entered the office with a large bundle of documents, and before his seat had even warmed, he began to report on the political affairs of the past week. Roland also put aside his thoughts and listened attentively. After over a month of acclimatization, he found that he was able to keep up with the pace of the other party, unlike at the beginning when he was completely confused and clueless.



Overall, the financial situation in Border Town had improved to some extent, mainly due to the sale of ores and uncut gems to Willow Town, which had brought in nearly two hundred Gold Royals. After using this money to purchase food and pay wages, there was still a surplus of ninety Gold Royals.



Barov was also in high spirits, with extra money in hand, getting through this winter wouldn't be too difficult.

However, Roland was not going to let him idle, "I need to select a group of people from the populace to fight against the demonic beasts, and they must start gathering for training immediately. The instructor will be my Chief Knight, and I will explain the details to him. You need to make a purchase plan; these people will all need sturdy leather armor and a long spear, as well as two sets of winter clothing for replacement."

"Your Highness, isn't it customary to conscript the populace for battle on a temporary basis?"

"An army that goes into battle without training is nothing but a mob. Do you think we can scare off the demonic beasts just because we outnumber them? If they fall apart, it becomes even more troublesome."

"Do you really intend to hold Border Town to the death?" Barov asked hesitantly.

"Of course, we'll retreat if we really can't hold it, but I don't think we can't deal with a few mutated beasts."

"If we follow your plan, it's going to cost more money."

Roland was amused by the other's miserly appearance, "These are necessary expenses, go and take care of it."

He still had over three hundred Gold Royals in his own treasury, mainly for paying the cost of building the town walls. The materials and parts needed for the steam engine ordered from the smithy were also paid out of his own pocket, with the first one nearly costing twenty Gold Royals, and he needed at least three more.



The steam engine did drive the first Industrial Revolution, but that does not mean the steam engine is synonymous with the Industrial Revolution. Historically, Britain was at a point where it urgently needed a new source of power to replace humans and animals in order to meet the production demands of the mining areas. After James Watt improved the steam engine, he immediately received a massive number of orders, and this new power source quickly became widespread across various industries.



At this time, Border Town had no foundation for an Industrial Revolution; one could even say that industry did not exist there at all. Therefore, Roland did not count on making his first pot of gold by selling steam engines. He merely wanted to introduce this machine into the mines of the Northern Slope Mountain to use for hauling ore and crushing rocks. Once the mine's output increased, he planned to expand the use of steam engines on a larger scale, promoting industrial development from the top down.
