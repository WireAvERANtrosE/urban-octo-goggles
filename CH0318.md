## Unknown
Roland moved the goose quill swiftly, rapidly writing down passages on the paper.

Before coming here, he spent his days in front of a computer drafting mechanical designs and thought he would rarely have the chance to write with a pen again. He hadn't expected to revert to this ancient method of record-keeping.

Two documents lay by his hand, both plans he intended to implement next.

One was for the mass production of sulfuric acid; the new equipment had already been manufactured by Anna and Soraya. The lead reaction vessels had been replaced with more durable and reliable iron shells, including an anti-corrosion coating, making them three times larger than the experimental versions.

Considering there was no way to collect or purify the waste gases at this stage (mainly from the combustion of sulfur and leakage of nitrogen oxides), Roland set up the facility far from the banks of the Redwater River and residential areas—at the southern end of the industrial park. He planned to build a plant around the reaction equipment for isolation and construct a chimney to increase the height for waste gas emissions.

Since increasing sulfuric acid production was greatly beneficial for expanding the production scale of concentrated nitric acid, getting the equipment into production was the current top priority. The content of the document was an order for Kemo Squirrel to select a group of disciples to specialize in the mass production of sulfuric acid, and for Barov to recruit some reliable local residents to serve as auxiliary laborers, with the chemical plant's first phase staff totaling around a hundred people.

The second document was about establishing a public healthcare system.

To be honest, Roland was not familiar with this area, let alone modern medicine. However, that didn't prevent him from using common sense to devise a rudimentary plan suited to current needs.

First and foremost, the department's primary role was to promote and educate about health, such as boiling water before drinking, thoroughly cooking meat, understanding the causes of illnesses and ways to respond, and the differences between parasites and microorganisms... With his growing prestige, it was not difficult to get the people to do something as instructed, but to make them understand why they needed to do it, there had to be dedicated efforts toward public education and promotion. If saying it once didn't work, then repeat it seven or eight times, dozens of times, just like the slogans hung in the fields; repeated often enough, everyone would gradually come to accept the notion.



Secondly, there is the encouragement of childbirth—the City Hall is short-staffed, and he is not willing to set up a separate family planning department, so for the time being, this matter has been incorporated into public healthcare. Population is always the scarcest resource in this era, so it is naturally best if the citizens can have more children. Nana's abilities also mitigate a series of thorny issues such as the risks associated with childbirth, as with her help, the postnatal survival rate can almost reach one hundred percent. Additionally, to prevent the abandonment of female infants and incidents of birth without care, he formulated detailed subsidy and punishment policies. For example, the subsidy for female infants is slightly higher than that for male infants, subsidies are distributed in installments, and abandonment of infants will face fines and imprisonment, among other measures.



The last point is about charging fees. Apart from childbirth treatment, the hospital will charge a certain fee based on the amount of magic power Nana consumes, which not only relieves the burden on the young girl but also lays the foundation for the future hospital system. The first head of the department Roland has already thought of is none other than Nana's father, Viscount Titus · Pine.



The third document is the one he is currently writing, and it is also the most complex and massive of all the plans—the construction plan for Border Town.



It involves the expansion and merging of the town itself with Longsong Stronghold, and it will certainly be necessary to enact a series of laws to govern the people of both places. The judicial system and public security system must also be supplemented. To write these contents flawlessly with just his own knowledge is certainly not enough. Roland plans to draft a preliminary proposal and then discuss and refine the other details with Barov, the Chief Officer of the City Hall.



After finishing the introductory part, he moved his somewhat sore and numb wrist and walked to the floor-to-ceiling glass window.



The weather today is very gloomy; the sun was not seen in the morning, and by the afternoon, the sky was already covered with dark clouds, as if a heavy rain was brewing. The chilly autumn wind swept through the castle's back garden, and the rustling sound from the olive grove could be heard.



Just then, a black dot appeared on the horizon and flew towards the castle.



"It's Lightning," Nightingale's voice came from behind.



"She probably went to the Misty Forest to pick mushrooms again," Roland chuckled. Usually, when there are no scouting missions, Lightning and Maggie's practice is entirely free flying, so it is normal for them not to return to the castle for lunch. According to the two of them, they often rummage through the woods for bird eggs and beehives, or catch some strange little animals to roast and eat, which is probably what the ultimate form of an explorer transforms into—Bear Grylls.



Additionally, even though most Bird Beak Mushrooms grow on trees, he always couldn't help but recall the anecdote of "the little girl who picked mushrooms."

"Your Highness, you... are smiling somewhat strangely."

"Cough cough, I just thought of an amusing little story, would you like to hear it?"

"Hm?"

Roland cleared his throat, "Once upon a time, there was a little girl who liked to pick mushrooms and count... Wait a second." The shadow grew larger, and unexpectedly, the other party did not sweep past the castle but instead lowered its altitude, heading straight for the office's French window. Roland paused, reached out to open the window, and Lightning darted into the room without hesitation.

"Your, Your Highness!" She landed and immediately started exclaiming excitedly, "I found a witch!"

"A witch?" Roland asked curiously, "Where?"

"In the stone tower of the Misty Forest," Lightning pointed towards Maggie, who flew into the office after her, "She can testify!"

"Coocoo!" Maggie looked up and said.



"The stone tower?" He frowned, "What exactly happened, tell me in detail."



After listening to Lightning's description, Roland couldn't help but take a sharp breath. This girl was too daring; she actually dared to explore the ancient ruins where devils were said to exist, with just a pigeon in tow. But what was even more terrifying was that there seemed to be a witch sealed within the ruins? Of course, it could also be an ordinary person sealed by the witch... In any case, it was a piece of unbelievable news.



"What's this about a cry for help?"



"It's this thing, I found it on the table behind her." Lightning took out a palm-sized square iron box from her pocket, which at first glance looked like a small mirror used during makeup. Upon opening the lid, there was a red gem set inside. She fiddled with the trigger next to the gem, and an anxious female voice suddenly appeared in everyone's ears.



"Save me..."



Roland shivered instantly. The voice, sometimes distant and sometimes close, was truly unsettling. If he had heard such a plea for help in a dark basement, he would have turned and left without a second thought.



"There is magical power in the gem," Nightingale appeared and clicked her tongue in wonder, "I can see a faint magic vortex, just like the one that circulates inside a witch."



Alright, it seemed like a magical recording device that could continuously emit sound. The possibility that it belonged to a witch had just increased. "Are there any other such stones in the basement of the stone tower?"



"I didn't look closely, many places in the room were flooded with water," Lightning shook her head, "At that time, all I wanted was to come back and tell you the news as soon as possible."



"Do not do this again in the future, especially going to dangerous places on your own," Roland patted her head and then turned to Nightingale, "Call together all the members of the Witch Union and Iron Axe to the office, the plan to search the ruins may need to be moved up."
