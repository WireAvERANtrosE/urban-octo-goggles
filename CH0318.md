Roland moved his goose quill swiftly across the paper, writing down segments of text with speed.



Before coming here, he spent his entire days in front of a computer designing mechanical blueprints. He thought he would rarely have the chance to write with a pen again, but now he found himself returning to this ancient method of record-keeping.



Two documents lay beside his hand, both plans he intended to implement next.



One was the mass production of sulfuric acid. The new equipment had already been manufactured by Anna and Soraya. The lead reaction vessels had been replaced with more robust and reliable iron shells, with an anti-corrosion coating on the inside, making them three times larger than the previous experimental models.



Considering that at present there was no way to collect or purify the waste gases generated (mainly from the burning of sulfur and the leakage of nitrogen oxides), Roland decided to set up the facility far from the banks of the Redwater River and residential areas—at the southern end of the industrial park. He planned to build a factory around the reaction devices for isolation and to erect a chimney to increase the height of the waste gas discharge.



Since increasing the production of sulfuric acid was of great help to expand the scale of concentrated nitric acid production, putting the equipment into production was the most important task at hand. The content of the document was an order for Kyle Sichi to select a group of disciples to work exclusively on the mass production of sulfuric acid. Barov was also to recruit some reliable local residents to serve as auxiliary workers; approximately a hundred people would be needed for the first phase of the chemical plant.



The second document was about establishing a public healthcare system.



To be honest, Roland was not familiar with this area, and even less so with modern medicine, but this did not prevent him from using common sense to formulate a rudimentary plan that met current needs.



The primary role of this department was to provide education and increase public knowledge, such as the need to boil water before drinking, to cook meat thoroughly, understanding the causes of illness and methods of response, and the differences between parasites and microbes... Thanks to his growing prestige, it was not difficult to get the people to do something as instructed, but to make them understand why they had to do it, there had to be someone dedicated to promoting and educating them. If saying it once was useless, then he would repeat it seven or eight times, dozens of times, just like the slogans hung in the fields, said over and over, until everyone gradually accepted the idea.



Secondly, there was the encouragement of childbirth—the City Hall was short-staffed, and he was unwilling to set up a separate family planning department, so he temporarily included this matter under public healthcare. The population was forever the scarcest resource of this era; the more the people of the territory could reproduce, the better. Nana's ability even solved a series of thorny issues such as the risks associated with childbirth. With her around, the survival rate post-delivery could almost reach one hundred percent. Additionally, to prevent the abandonment of female infants and incidents of birthing without care, he established detailed subsidy and penalty policies, such as slightly higher subsidies for female infants, phased subsidy distribution, and fines and imprisonment for those who abandoned their babies.



The last point was about charging fees. Aside from childbirth treatments, the hospital would charge a certain fee based on the amount of magic power Nana consumed. This was both to reduce the burden on the young girl and to lay the foundation for a future hospital system. The first department head Roland had already thought of was Nana's father, Viscount Titus Pine.



The third document was the one he was currently writing, which was also the most complex and extensive of all the plans—the Border Town construction project.



It involved the expansion of the town itself and the integration of Longsong Stronghold, which would definitely require the enactment of a series of laws to govern the people of both places, and also the need to establish a judiciary system and public security system. To draft these contents without any gaps, his own knowledge was definitely insufficient. Roland planned to first draft a proposal, and then discuss and refine the other details with the City Hall's Chief Officer, Barov.



After finishing the introductory part, he moved his somewhat sore wrist and walked over to the floor-to-ceiling window.



The weather was quite gloomy today; the sun hadn't been seen since morning, and by afternoon, the sky was covered with dark clouds, as if a heavy rain was brewing. A slightly chilly autumn wind swept through the castle's back garden, and the rustling sound of the olive trees could be heard.



At this moment, a black dot appeared on the horizon and flew towards the castle.



"It's Lightning," Nightingale's voice came from behind him.



"She probably went to the Misty Forest to pick mushrooms again," Roland laughed. Usually, when there was no scouting mission, Lightning and Maggie's practice was entirely free flight, so it was normal for them not to return to the castle for lunch. According to the two of them, they would often dig out bird eggs and beehives in the woods, or catch some rare and curious little animals to roast and eat, probably the ultimate form of an explorer would transform into Bear Grylls.



Additionally, although the Bird Beak Mushroom primarily grows on trees, he couldn't help but think of the anecdote of the "little girl picking mushrooms."



"Your Highness, you... have a somewhat strange smile."

"Cough cough, I just thought of a funny little story. Would you like to hear it?"

"Um?"

Roland cleared his throat, "Once upon a time, there was a little girl who liked to pick mushrooms while counting... Wait a second." The shadow grew larger and unexpectedly, instead of sweeping past the castle, it descended in altitude, heading straight for the floor-to-ceiling window of the office. Roland stared for a moment, reached out to open the window, and Lightning darted into the room without pause.



"Your, Your Highness!" She landed and immediately began to exclaim excitedly, "I've found a witch!"

"A witch?" Roland asked curiously, "Where?"

"In the stone tower of the Misty Forest," Lightning pointed towards Maggie, who flew into the office after her, "She can testify!"

"Goo goo!" Maggie looked up and spoke.



"Stone tower?" He frowned. "What exactly happened? Tell me in detail."



After listening to Lightning's description, Roland couldn't help but take a deep breath. This guy was too bold, daring to explore the ancient ruins where devils were present with just a pigeon. What was even more frightening was that there was actually a witch sealed within the ruins? Of course, it could also be an ordinary person sealed by a witch... Regardless, this was an astonishing piece of news.



"What's the deal with the cry for help?"



"It's this thing, I found it on the desk behind her." Lightning took out a palm-sized square iron box from her pocket. At first glance, it looked like a small mirror used for applying makeup. Lifting the lid, there was a red gemstone embedded inside. She manipulated a trigger next to the gemstone, and the anxious voice of a woman suddenly filled everyone's ears.



"Save me..."



Roland shivered immediately; the voice was sometimes distant and sometimes close, truly a bit eerie. If he had heard such a plea for help in a dark basement, he would have definitely turned around and left without a second thought.



"The gemstone contains magic," Nightingale appeared and marveled, "I can see a faint magic vortex, just like the one that circulates within a witch."



Alright, it seemed to be a magic-powered sound recorder that could continue to emit sound, and the possibility that the other party was a witch just increased. "Are there any other stones like this in the stone tower's basement?"



"I didn't look closely; many parts of the room were flooded with water," Lightning shook her head, "At that time, all I wanted was to come back and tell you this news as soon as possible."



"Never do this again, especially going to dangerous places on your own," Roland patted her head, then turned to Nightingale. "Gather all the members of the Witch Union and Iron Axe to the office, the plan to search the ruins might need to be carried out ahead of schedule."
