## Municipal construction
"Where is the person who delivered these? Have they been classified and counted?" Roland asked.



"Yes, please look here," the assistant minister pointed to the bottom of the scroll, "A total of eleven hundred people have been sent to Border Town. Most of them are serfs, who have been settled outside the town as per your instructions. There are thirty-five craftsmen who have been assigned to Karl for command. Their residences are concentrated in the 'New District of Civilization'," Barov said, using that difficult term, "But Your Highness, is this alright? I remember that this was originally prepared for the witches."



"The personal guards I sent out to spread rumors have not returned yet, and this matter is progressing slower than I imagined. Let the houses be used by the craftsmen and their families for now; we can build more later." In Roland's plan, Border Town was to be completely renovated. Wooden houses and mud-brick cottages were to be rebuilt into brick houses, while also leaving spacious streets, rather than most alleys being just wide enough for two people to walk side by side.



"Yes," Barov nodded, "Your Highness, I heard that cattle and sheep will also be transported there?"



"Mmm, but not now. I've specifically asked for them to be sent later, along with the herdsmen. To the west of the city wall, isn't there a grassland between the Impassable Mountain Range and the Forest of the End? It should be good to convert it into a pasture. First, we'll blast two gaps in the city wall for people to pass through, as it's only useful during the Evil Months."



Now that he had both people and money, the bottleneck that had been restraining the development of Border Town had temporarily disappeared, and Roland could finally let go and put his plans into action.



He called in the guard outside the door and instructed, "Go find Karl from the Town Hall. If he's not at the mines, then he must be in the wooden shed area outside the town."



Half an hour later, Karl walked into the office and bowed, "Your Highness."



It had been almost half a year since Roland first met this member of the Stonemason's Guild. After being recruited into the Border Town City Hall, he could be considered the busiest official in the past six months, overseeing the construction of the city wall, the model housing district, and the temporary wooden shed area. Now thirty-five years old, with a few strands of silver beginning to show at his temples and his skin darkening a bit, he looked much more spirited than when Roland first saw him, and his voice was full of vigor.



The environment can indeed rapidly change a person, a truth that has been proven once more. Half a year ago, he was a careful stonemason refugee who hid himself and changed his appearance. Now, after having directed projects and personally managed construction work, he exudes the aura of a leader. However, what Roland appreciated the most was his spirit of willingness to contribute to others.



Roland nodded with a smile, "Come, sit at the table." He passed the several sketches he had just drawn across to the other side, "Take a look. I need you to build some new things."



"This is a warehouse, hmm, raising the base can effectively prevent dampness," Karl quickly glanced over the first sketch, and when he flipped to the second one, he studied it for quite a while, "This... is this a kiln?"



"That's right. You need to build more than five kilns on the slope of North Hill, to calcine cement and to fire clay bricks. Choose a site that's fairly open, considering the transport route and the storage area. Later on, we'll need to expand and build more kilns."



"Understood." He flipped to the last sketch and frowned, "This... seems to be a ditch? No, there's a roof and a retaining wall above... and what looks like a pool at the back. Your Highness, I don't quite understand."



Roland chuckled, "This is a toilet, and it's the project you should prioritize."



"A toilet?" Karl pondered for a moment, "Your Highness, where do you plan to build it? Your castle has chamber pots, and the servants are responsible for dealing with these pots regularly. And for the most part, the villagers don't need such a thing, as they can take care of their business just outside their homes. Serfs do the same, disposing of it into the Redwater River, and the river carries away the filth."



That's why there was such a strong stench when we were docking today, Roland shook his head, dispelling the unpleasant memory, "Exactly, that's why we need to change these bad habits."



"Eh... bad habits?" Karl looked somewhat puzzled.



For the commoners who were accustomed to relieving themselves anywhere, they naturally would not understand how wonderful a world where one could wander around without stepping on any landmines could be, Roland thought to himself sarcastically. "In any case, just follow the blueprint. I've already marked the approximate dimensions, using the lengths we previously settled on. Choose a location near the wooden shack area, build at least four of them, with two close together. Apart from the central drainage ditch, which should be bricked, use wooden planks for the outer shacks, roof panels, and partitions to save on cement."



"Your Highness, you want to concentrate them... uh," Karl hesitated, obviously feeling it was beneath royal dignity to discuss such filthy matters in front of His Highness, "but what if they refuse to use them?"



"I will issue a command for them to comply. You can go and organize the manpower to implement it."



"In that case, I will follow Your Will," he nodded, "Prince Roland, there is another matter I wish to report to you."



"Go on."



"After the Stonemason's Guild was forced to disband, many people, like myself, chose to leave the capital. I would like to write a few letters to summon those Stonemason's Guild members whose whereabouts I know to Border Town. They each have their strengths, for instance, Rosia is very skilled in kiln construction. Your Highness, I was wondering..."



"There's no problem at all," Roland immediately approved, "You can invite all of them to re-establish the Stonemason's Guild here. Pay them as you would the Stonemason's Guild, and for those with rich experience, it's also fine to incorporate them into the City Hall."



"Thank you for your generosity," Karl bowed in thanks.



After the stonemason left, he began to draft the management and emancipation system for the serfs.



Border Town's population was soon to face a peak period of growth. If they continued to rely on imported grain, the town would be in a precarious position if a natural disaster occurred or if trade routes were cut off. Therefore, besides industry, agriculture must also be rapidly developed to achieve self-sufficiency in food production as soon as possible.



The prince believed that by establishing a path for promotion, these serfs would quickly transform into active farmers. Coupled with the improved seeds from Leaf, the farmlands beside the Redwater River would turn into a golden sea of wheat by summer.



The priority given to the construction of toilets was also in preparation for agricultural development—after having people, land, and seeds, the last component needed was fertilizer.



Roland was of course aware that using human and animal waste was very troublesome; it required regular cleaning of the storage tanks and relied on manual labor to compost, far less convenient than chemical fertilizers. But since the chemical industry was not even in its initial stages, he had to use this purely natural organic fertilizer as a substitute—at least human and animal waste had withstood the test of time, and until the twentieth century, this traditional method of fertilization could still be seen in some rural areas.



The people of this other world had a pitiable understanding of fertilizers. The vast majority considered excrement to be filthy and, except for using it to disgust others, never thought that it could actually be quite useful. Therefore, in their annual cultivation, the farmers still practiced the three-field system, dividing a plot of land into three parts to be used in rotation for spring planting, autumn planting, and fallowing, in order to avoid exhausting the soil's fertility through continuous cultivation.
