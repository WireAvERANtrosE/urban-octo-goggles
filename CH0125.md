## Municipal Construction
"What about the people who were sent here? Is there a classification and count?" Roland asked.

"Yes, please see below," the minister's assistant pointed to the bottom of the scroll, "A total of one thousand one hundred people have been sent to Border Town thus far. Most of them are serfs, and they have been settled outside the town as per your instructions. There are thirty-five craftsmen who have been assigned to Karl's command, and their residence is concentrated in the 'New District of Civilization,'" Barov pronounced the awkward term, "However, Your Highness, is this alright? I remember it was originally prepared for the witches."

"My personal guards sent out to spread rumors have not yet returned, and things are progressing slower than I had imagined. Let the houses be used by the craftsmen and their families for now; we can always build more later." In Roland's plan, Border Town was to be completely renovated, with wooden houses and mud-brick bungalows to be replaced with brick houses, while also leaving spacious streets, rather than the current situation where most alleys only allowed two people to walk side by side.

"Yes," Barov nodded, "Your Highness, I heard that cows and sheep will also be brought over there?"

"Mhm, but not now. I've specifically asked for them to be sent a few days later, along with the herdsmen. To the west of the city wall, between the Impassable Mountain Range and the Impassable Forest, isn't there a plain? It would be good to turn it into a pasture. We'll first blast two gaps in the city wall for people to pass through, after all, it is only useful during the Evil Months."

Now with both people and money on hand, the bottleneck that had been restricting the development of Border Town was temporarily gone, and Roland could finally let loose and do as he wished.

He called the guards outside the door and ordered, "Go find Karl from the Administrative Office. If he's not at the mine, he must be in the wooden shed area outside of town."

Half an hour later, Karl entered the office and bowed, saying, "Your Highness."

It had been nearly half a year since Roland first saw this member of the Stonemason's Guild. Since being recruited into the administration of Border Town, he could be considered the busiest official over this half-year period, overseeing the construction of the city walls, the model housing district, and the temporary wooden shed area. At thirty-five years old, his temples were now tinged with a few strands of silver, and his skin had darkened, but his spirit was much stronger than when they first met, and his voice was full of vigor.

Indeed, the environment can quickly change a person—a truth evidenced by the fact that just half a year ago, he was a careful stonemason fleeing in disguise, yet now, after directing projects and taking charge of construction, he has acquired the air of a leader. However, what Roland appreciated most was his willingness to make sacrifices for others.

With a smile, Roland nodded, "Come sit at the table." He passed a few sketches he had just drawn across to the other side, "Take a look. I need you to build some new things."

"This is a warehouse, hmm, raised at the bottom for effective moisture prevention," Karl quickly glanced at the first sketch and then spent a while examining the second, "This... is it a stove?"

"That's right, you need to build more than five kilns on the side of North Slope Mountain for calcining cement and firing clay bricks. Choose a location that's open and consider the positioning of transport routes and storage areas. In the future, we will need to expand with more kilns."

"Yes." He flipped to the last sketch and furrowed his brows, "This... seems to be a ditch? No, there's a roof and retaining walls... And at the back, there's something like a pool. Your Highness, I don't quite understand."

Roland chuckled, "This is a toilet, and it's your highest priority construction project."

"A toilet?" Karl pondered for a moment, "Your Highness, where do you plan to build it? There are chamber pots in your castle, and the attendants regularly take care of them. And most villagers don't need such a thing—they just take care of it outside their homes. The serfs do the same, just dumping it into the Redwater River, and the river carries away the filth."

That's why there was such a strong smell when approaching the shore today. Roland shook his head, dispelling the unpleasant memory, "That's exactly why we need to change this bad habit."

"Uh... bad habit?" Karl looked somewhat puzzled.

For the commoners who were accustomed to relieving themselves wherever they pleased, they naturally couldn't understand how wonderful a world where one could wander around without stepping on a landmine would be, Roland thought to himself with a sneer. "In any case, follow the sketch to build it, I've already marked the general dimensions, using the length we determined earlier. Choose a location near the wooden shed area, build at least four, with two paired together. Apart from the central ditch that needs to be built with bricks, the outer shed, roof, and partitions should all be made of wooden boards, this way we can save a lot of cement."

"Your Highness, you want to concentrate them... that," Karl hesitated for a moment, obviously feeling that discussing such filthy matters in front of His Highness was an affront to royal dignity, "But what if they refuse to go in?"

"I will issue an order for them to comply. You can go and organize the manpower to implement it."

"If that is the case, I shall heed Your Will," he nodded, "Your Highness Roland, there is another matter I wish to report to you."

"Go ahead."

"After the Stonemason's Guild was forced to disband, many people, like myself, chose to leave the capital. I would like to write a few letters to summon those members of the Stonemason's Guild whose whereabouts I know to Border Town. They each have their own expertise, like the kiln you mentioned, Rosia is very skilled at it. Your Highness, I wonder..."

"There's no problem at all," Roland immediately decided, "You can summon them all to reconstitute the Stonemason's Guild, and the payment will be the same as before. Those with rich experience can also be incorporated into the City Hall."

"Thank you for your generosity," Karl bowed deeply in gratitude.

After the stonemason left, Roland began to draft the management and enfranchisement system for serfs.

Border Town's population is about to face a surge in growth, and if we continue to rely on imported grain, a natural disaster or a blockade of trade routes could leave the town in a precarious position. Hence, in addition to industrial development, agriculture must also be rapidly developed to achieve self-sufficiency in food production as soon as possible.
The prince believes that by establishing a path of advancement, these serfs will quickly transform into proactive farmers. Coupled with the improved seeds from Leaf, the farmlands by the Redwater River will turn into a golden sea of wheat by summer.
The priority of constructing toilets is also to support agricultural development—after securing people, land, and seeds, the last piece of the puzzle is fertilizer.
Roland, of course, knows that human and animal manure is very troublesome to use, requiring regular cleaning of storage pools and manual composting, which is far less convenient than chemical fertilizers. But since the chemical industry doesn't even have a starting point yet, he has no choice but to use this pure natural organic fertilizer as a substitute—at least human and animal manure has stood the test of time, and until the twentieth century, this traditional method of fertilization can still be seen in some rural areas.
The people of this other world have very little understanding of fertilizer, with the vast majority considering excrement a filthy substance, useful for nothing other than to disgust others, without ever considering its potential benefits. Therefore, in their annual cultivation, the farmers still adhere to the three-field system, dividing the farmland into three parts, rotating between spring planting, autumn planting, and fallowing, to prevent continuous cultivation from depleting the soil's fertility.
