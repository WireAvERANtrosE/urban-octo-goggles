## This phrase "心塞" is a bit tricky to translate directly because it is a Chinese internet slang term that is used to express a feeling of frustration or being upset, similar to the feeling of having something stuck in your heart. In the context of the novel "Release that Witch" and depending on the situation, it could be translated as "frustrating" or "suffocating." However, without a specific context, providing an exact translation is challenging. If you could provide the surrounding text or the situation in which the term is used, I could offer a more accurate translation.
Andrea had just climbed onto a corner of the city wall when she witnessed a shocking scene.

She saw a row of soldiers dressed as militiamen standing on the parapets, holding strange weapons in their hands—these were undoubtedly the firearms that Ashes had mentioned. As the demonic beasts approached, the firearms spewed flames and thick smoke, with continuous explosions echoing in her ears.

It must be a weapon similar to a crossbow, but she couldn’t see any bolts being fired, probably because of the heavy smoke. The demonic beasts at the forefront seemed to be heavily struck by something, their bodies halting abruptly before they toppled to the ground one after another.

But the soldiers neither observed the results of their shooting nor reloaded any bolts. Instead, they continued firing at the enemy, even faster than Andrea could nock and loose arrows.

"Is this the terrifying weapon you spoke of?" Andrea's lips felt a little dry, "The rate of fire is indeed very fast, but the accuracy seems..."



"These men were recruited to the First Army from miners, farmers, and hunters," Ashes interrupted, "They have been using these weapons for less than half a year."

It takes five years to train a skilled soldier, and even longer for an archer. Even the crossbow, which requires the shortest training time, still takes about half a year to ensure that a farmer will not panic and load the bolt incorrectly. As for actual combat? God knows what they could hit; in most cases, they were just there to make some noise.

Andrea swallowed involuntarily. She was not unfamiliar with this training; her family had also trained outstanding knights, so she naturally understood what it meant to be combat-ready in about half a year. As long as weapons and provisions were sufficiently supplied, Roland could assemble a large army in a short time, and this army would not fear crumbling in close combat, their relentless attacks preventing even the most elite knights from getting close.

This had nothing to do with the courage and will of the militiamen; it was the weapons that gave them tremendous power.



"Do you have any other knowledge about the firearms?" Tilly pondered for a moment before asking Sylvie.

The latter nodded, "I've observed them carefully many times. They are indeed a kind of weapon similar to crossbows, firing very short arrows without shafts or fletching. The difference is that the arrows are not propelled by the elasticity of the bowstring but by the impact of the explosion of a black powder—it can accelerate the arrow to an extremely high speed in an instant."

"Black powder?" Ashes inquired, "What is that?"

"It's probably some kind of alchemical product," she shook her head, "I'm not clear on the specific components."

"It must be very expensive," Andrea said, "the things that alchemists make are never cheap."

Ashes curled her lips, "Is that so... But looking at their shooting demeanor, they don't seem to be using anything particularly expensive."

"Wait, something is coming," Sylvie, who was observing the battlefield, suddenly stiffened, "My God, is that also a demonic beast? It's almost as tall as the city walls! It looks like a giant turtle with a huge shell on its back."

Andrea immediately perked up, "A shell? These firearms might have limited effects, but just let me get within ten steps, and not even city walls can block my magic arrows. Ashes, cover me."

"Huh, alright," Ashes resignedly took down the greatsword from her back, "Just so we’re clear, don't let down Lady Tilly."



"Don't go," Sylvie stopped them, "They still have—"



Andrea didn't catch the rest of her words. She only heard a deafening roar, like thunder exploding next to her ear. Turning her head, she saw the metal tube-like structures on the city wall spewing flames in unison. This time, she vaguely caught the trajectory of the flying arrows— they were like ghostly shadows, speeding toward the newly appeared monsters with lightning speed.



Moments later, several snow pillars several yards high rose around the monsters. After the drifting snowflakes settled, the ugly, enormous demonic beasts continued at a constant speed—clearly, this attack had missed.



Even so, Andrea was still utterly amazed... This distance was already far beyond that of longbows and heavy crossbows, "This is..."



"Her Highness calls it a field artillery piece. Simply put, it's a scaled-up arquebus," Sylvie removed her hands from her ears, "It's much more powerful than an arquebus and has a much longer range. It was with this that he easily defeated Timothy's militia fleet at the fork of the Redwater River."



The demonic beast's luck did not continue. The second round of artillery fire hit its carapace with two accurate shots. Andrea saw it very clearly: the uneven carapace raised a mist under the dull thud, and two large holes were blasted directly near the head. Black blood and innards spewed from the holes, splattering everywhere.



The battle ended not long after it began, with the corpses of demonic beasts lying in front of the city walls. The heat from the flowing blood caused white mist to rise above the snow. The soldiers began their cleanup work, while she never found an opportunity to make her move.



"It seems I miscalculated," Tilly said with a resigned smile, "He doesn't need the help of combat witches after all."



"Last time I was in town, this weapon was not yet widely distributed, only the Chief Knight could possess one. Now he's actually made so many..." Ashes sighed, "Perhaps this is precisely the reason why His Highness dares to insist on the public existence of witches despite the immense pressure from the Church."



Andrea did not respond. If it had been any other time, she would have certainly mocked Ashes, but now she only felt an unusual sense of suffocation in her heart, lacking even the energy to argue.



Upon returning to the castle, Prince Roland still prepared a lavish lunch for the witches.



Seeing the colorful dishes on the table, Andrea felt even more stifled in her heart.



The upper class of the Dawn Kingdom valued the natural beauty of food, willing to spend a great deal of Gold Royals and effort to acquire some rare and treasured ingredients, then cook them in the most original way possible. The food of Graycastle, covered in various spices and sauces, seemed to her a very crude way of eating—seasonings were but a way to cover up the food's own defects, the more you added, the worse the taste.



And yet... every dish on the table was terrifyingly delicious.



Take the charcoal-grilled mushrooms, for instance—where on earth did His Highness find such plump and juicy mushrooms? Just a slight bite, and the juice that overflowed could almost fill one's mouth.



Then there was the green vegetable soup, which looked very plain with its clear broth, but when tasted, it had a rich umami flavor as if it were made from a whole chicken, ribs, and kelp.



The most special was the dessert after the meal—ice cream sandwiched between bread. The ice cream, overflowing with the scent of milk, sandwiched between two slices of bread, gave a sensation of being both cold and soft that was simply addictive. Even though it was "winter," nothing could stop her from eating one slice after another.



Damn it, even in this, she had completely lost.



Gazing at Ashes, who was giving her a provocative smile, Andrea for the first time did not respond in any way.
