## Legacy (Part 2)
Maine was stunned, staring at the old man in front of him, trying to discern something from his eyes. 

However, they were cloudy. 

His gaze was no longer as deep and intimidating as it used to be, piercing straight to the heart. He might possess the wisdom passed down from all the previous pontiffs, the knowledge acquired from the Holy Book of Laws, but... none of it could withstand the ravages of time. 

His Holiness was not jesting, Maine realized, his journey had reached its end. 

His eyes began to blur. 

He knelt down once more, his forehead touching the ground, and this time His Holiness did not tell him to stand as before. Instead, after Maine had completed the full set of movements, he finally spoke, "Follow me." 

The guards attending the Pope helped him onto a cart and then pushed him toward the gates of the Secret Area. Maine followed closely behind, and the group left the Secret Sanctum, turning into a narrow tunnel. On the smooth stone walls, a luminous crystal was embedded every ten steps, and looking ahead, the end could not be seen at a glance. 

After an unknown period, Maine finally left the passage, his vision suddenly clearing, and the ground beneath his feet turned into a flat stone floor. He could see the angular walls and chandeliers hanging from the ceiling, clearly, this secret passage connected to an underground chamber. 

"We are beneath the great cathedral of the Old Holy City," the Pope said, perhaps noticing his confusion, "The structure here is completely identical to the great cathedral, but it was built in reverse. I am accustomed to calling it the Reflection Church."



"The basement of the cathedral?" Mayne said in surprise, "I always thought there was no basement there."

"Indeed, there isn't, because the two are not connected," O'Brien smiled, "One can only get here through the underground passage from the Secret Area. The ceiling is made of several feet thick stone slabs mixed with clay, impossible to penetrate by ordinary means."

"Why... design it this way?"

"To keep the secret safe, yet not to bury it completely," he said, "Before any Pope takes office, they must come to the Reflection Church to witness the establishment, development, and growth of the Church, and at the same time, etch the Church's goals in their heart."

"To defeat the devils," Mayne said solemnly.

But O'Brien did not nod in confirmation; instead, he sighed softly, "No, child, it's to win the smile of God."

The Archbishop was stunned, "What?"

The Pope didn't respond to him but signaled the guards to keep moving. Judging by the direction of the stairs and ramps, they seemed to be climbing upwards. Soon, the group arrived at a grand hall, which Mayne recognized as the prayer room of the Reflection Church, based on the familiar structures around him.

The thick wooden door was slowly pushed open, creaking. Although it seemed like the Pope had not visited this hall for a long time, Mayne did not smell any dust... Clearly, someone had been responsible for cleaning it.



"They could only take me this far, you'll have to push me in from here," O'Brien said.

"Yes, Your Holiness," Maine took the handle and pushed the Pope into the prayer room. The wooden door behind them closed again, completely blocking out the light from the torches. Now, only the soft glow emitted by the yellow crystals in the room remained—just like in the secret passage, they were evenly embedded on both sides of the wall. However, the difference was that above the crystals hung a huge portrait; he vaguely remembered that the position of the painting frame should be exactly where the window opening of the prayer room on the ground was.



The contents of the portraits were more or less the same, all being half-length portraits of people. They were dressed in magnificent robes, looking spirited and bright-eyed, as if they were gazing at every visitor who entered the prayer room. Among them, Maine was startled to see a portrait of His Holiness O'Brien—the painted figure was almost identical to the real person, staring at him with a smile. This eerie feeling made him shudder involuntarily, and goosebumps rose on his back.



"Ah, you've seen me," the Pope probably sensed the bishop's emotional change, "This painting was completed half a year ago. I wasn't as old as I am now; it must have looked a bit better when it was painted. But it was supposed to be hung up after my death," he examined it carefully, "I really was too impatient, wanting to see what I would look like hanging up there."



"Your Holiness, are these..." Maine felt a dryness in his throat.



"Yes, they are all great pioneers, the former Popes," he spoke softly, "Continue forward, and I will introduce each one to you."



The Archbishop listened to His Holiness O'Brien's brief introductions while examining the portraits—despite knowing they were once the highest leaders of the church, an inexplicable eeriness still lingered in his heart. The figures in the paintings were too lifelike, and he couldn't imagine what kind of techniques and dyes the artist had to use to create such half-length portraits. Coupled with the not-so-bright yellow light, as one walked further, the upper parts of these portraits would gradually fade into darkness, leaving only half a face grinning at him.



Halfway through the hall, Maine suddenly noticed that the figures in the portraits had changed to women.



They varied in appearance and attire, but all could be considered beautiful and charming—such outstanding looks were rare on the faces of ordinary people, and the bishop was not unfamiliar with this. Yet, precisely because of this, he felt utterly perplexed and astonished. However, His Holiness O'Brien seemed to have no reaction, still calmly introducing their names, terms, and achievements.



These people are all pontiffs of the Church.

The prayer room quickly came to an end.

Facing the central aisle of the hall was a full-length portrait occupying the entire wall. It hung behind the prayer stand, surrounded by luminous crystals, making the image even clearer.

Mayne swallowed and looked toward the person in the painting.

The moment his gaze fell upon the painting, he felt his heart skip a beat—oh my God, what an unparalleled woman she was. Beyond this word, he found it difficult to find others to describe her. She possessed both the delicate charm of a woman and the firmness of a man, a natural blend of both, appearing together without any conflict. Her head full of red hair was like burning flames, while the cold and reckless greatsword in her hand was the frost extinguishing the flames of desire. She stood leaning on her sword, her eyebrows slightly raised, eyes looking down, lips tightly closed, commanding awe without anger. Under those sharp, compelling eyes, Mayne felt an overwhelming pressure that almost made him want to kneel before this woman.

"Your Majesty, this is..."

He struggled to turn his head, only to find that Oberlein had already knelt down.

"She is the first pontiff, above the Extraordinary, Akaris. She has another title—the Witch Queen."

Mayne's heart thumped again; his earlier conjecture was entirely correct—the early succession of pontiffs of the Church were all witches!



"Why would the creator of the Church also be a witch?"

"Kneel before her and pay your respects, child. Afterward, I will show you everything you want to know."
