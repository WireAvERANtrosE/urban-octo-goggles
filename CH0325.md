## Arrow of Light
Tilly infused magic into her flight magic stone, soared into the sky, and overlooked the entire deck.

The crew of the Beauty of the Seas were mostly experienced sailors who, after the initial chaos, picked up weapons nearby and engaged in fierce combat with the demonic beasts, gradually moving toward the stern of the ship. It was clear that they too understood that they could not defeat such a large number of enemies on their own, and their only hope lay in the witches aboard.

With Ashes joining the battlefield, the situation quickly shifted.

She was like a whirlwind, everywhere she went was marked by the wails and howls of monsters. Any demonic beast daring to face her giant sword was bisected, leaving limbs and severed parts scattered all over the deck.

Andrea was not to be outdone; her magic longbow could shoot any handy object as an arrow, with both power and accuracy that were astonishing. Therefore, she seldom prepared regular arrows and instead used a bag of glass beads. The demonic beasts hit by her shots did not even have time to scream before they twitched and collapsed on the ground—the hard marbles were capable of piercing through skulls within twenty paces, turning everything inside to mush.

Leaf and Sylvie were moving back and forth on the deck, tending to the injured sailors. With the protection of the invisible barrier, the demonic beasts could not get anywhere near the two of them.

Even as the demonic beasts were rapidly being exterminated, Tilly did not let her guard down.

These fish-like creatures were clearly not the cause of the severe shaking that the Beauty of the Seas initially experienced—it felt as though a massive monster was ramming the ship from underwater. Without Molly's Servants to protect it, a few more such impacts and the ship would likely be reduced to a pile of broken planks floating on the sea. The witches might barely be able to save themselves, but most of the sailors would probably not escape the fate of being buried in the bellies of fish.

As expected, when the last demonic beast was flattened by Ashes' greatsword, a huge shadow emerged in the seawater to the left front of the ship—that size was definitely not something a fish could achieve. The shadow rapidly approached the surface and charged toward the Beauty of the Seas.



"Careful!" she shouted.



Before her warning faded, a shadow flashed beneath the vessel and the sailboat shook violently once again. The masts creaked with a series of terrifying noises, as if they could collapse at any moment. Fortunately, the shadow did not launch any other attacks and quickly disappeared into the depths of the sea—perhaps it had intended to flip the Beauty of the Sea over with its back and then feast to its heart's content.



Tilly landed back on deck and briefly explained the situation.



"We must drive it out of the water, or else this damned creature will sooner or later sink the ship," Ashes frowned.



"I'll give it a try," Sylvie said. "Since it's coming right up against the ship's bottom, as long as I'm close enough, I can use my barriers to block its ramming."



"By the Sea God," Old Jack wiped the sweat from his forehead, "if the creature is as huge as Lady Tilly says, ordinary attacks probably won't work. Even if we force it to the surface, how do we kill it?"



"Leave it to me," Andrea tucked a fallen lock of hair behind her ear, revealing a confident smile. "Within ten paces, no enemy can withstand my full force blow."



The shadow quickly reappeared, this time changing its approach and charging towards the Beauty of the Sea from the stern.



Tilly, who was monitoring from the air, immediately sent out a warning signal. Sylvie ran to her position and jumped off the ship's rail, her waist securely tied with several loops of hemp rope—the other end of the rope was held in Ashes's hands, who was steadying her descent.



Shadows struck, and Sylvie instantly unfurled her barrier. A crack abruptly appeared in the murky seawater, as if it were parted by some invisible force.

The monster slammed into the barrier, its massive form suddenly coming to a halt. Sylvie let out a muffled groan, her arms drooping weakly as if she had expended a great deal of strength. The shadow at her feet rapidly expanded, and the seawater surged upwards.



"Quick, pull her up!" Tilly dove down and shouted.

Ashes pulled with one arm, just getting Sylvie onto the deck, when a huge sea beast roared as it burst out of the water. The waves it raised made the Seagull sway from side to side. At first glance, it looked like a hybrid of a saber-toothed shark and an octopus, with several tentacles extending from its triangular head, slapping directly towards the deck.



Even by the sound of it, one could tell it was extremely furious at this inexplicable collision. The tentacles, as thick as an adult's thigh, swept the railings into disarray, but they could not breach the defense Sylvie was barely maintaining.



"Andrea!" Ashes bent down, her ten fingers coming together, cupping her hands into a bowl shape.

"I'm on it," the latter stepped onto Ashes' palms, "Leave it to me!"



The Extraordinary threw her upward, and Witch Andrea formed an arc in the air, in the blink of an eye she was already flying above the monster's head.

She summoned her magic bow, drew it to full span, and between the bow and the string, a dazzling light suddenly exploded. The light was like the sun breaking through the clouds, turning the sea surface into a golden expanse.



"Go!" 

A flash of lightning streaked across the sky, and the arrow, purely made of magic power, emitted a piercing roar as it plunged into the monster's body like thunder. The monster's gray-brown skin immediately swelled, golden cracks spread throughout its body, and strands of light shone from within. Then, with a thunderous boom, it exploded into pieces.



The massive explosion sent ripples across the sea surface, and black blood, like ink, dyed the water pitch black. Shattered innards fell like rain, and the tentacles that had been entwining the ship shrank back, sinking into the seabed along with the head-blasted behemoth.



Andrea plopped into the sea.



"Ah... Help, help me, I can't swim! Glub, who... who will give me a hand?"



Ashes looked at Sylvie, who was visibly exhausted, and sighed helplessly. "What a show-off idiot." She undid the giant sword on her back and dove into the sea, swimming towards the other.



Tilly finally breathed a sigh of relief. The threat of the sinking ship was removed, and at least she didn't have to worry about having to swim to Border Town now.



Suddenly, she felt a chill at the tip of her nose and looked up, only to be stunned in place.



Unbeknownst to her, the gray sky had started to sprinkle down snowflakes, which danced through the air like sprites, filling her entire field of vision.



"Is this... snow?" Wendy gazed in amazement at the melting ice crystal in her hand. "Does it snow in autumn in Graycastle?"



"Hah, I was wondering why it was getting colder as we headed west," One-Eyed Jack relit his pipe, "It seems you truly come from a place beset by turmoil."



Tilly did not respond, but her expression was serious. Wendy hailed from the Kingdom of Dawn, where it was spring all year round, while Old Jack was a Fjords man, who seldom saw heavy snowfall even in winter. But for the Western Region of Graycastle, snow held a special significance.



The court sorcerer once said that this relentless snowfall, accompanied by the horn of the devil's invasion, signifies the beginning of the Evil Months, and it will not cease until the Evil Months come to an end.



Although the Evil Months never had a fixed end date, they generally started in winter. Could it be that Border Town was already under attack by the demonic beasts? Moreover, water ghosts were mostly found to the east of Scorched Ridge, but now even the extreme southern tip of the sea had seen signs of them. Tilly worried whether the merchant ships traveling to and from the kingdom would be attacked by these monsters.



Growing increasingly concerned, Tilly finally saw the hazy coastline after sailing through the heavy snow for two days.
