## Conscience
After dinner, Roland returned to his office and continued to transcribe the basic mathematical knowledge in his mind onto paper.



He did not possess a photographic memory, and moreover, memory fades with the passage of time. Due to his profession, he often used mathematics and physics, but his knowledge in other areas such as history, geography, biology, and chemistry had probably degraded to a beginner's level. Therefore, whether or not it would be used, writing down the content he had not yet forgotten as soon as possible would allow him to retain more knowledge.



Each time he filled a page, he let Scroll, who was by his side, glance over it. Any content viewed by her was equivalent to being permanently saved. Unfortunately, Scroll's ability was only related to memory and did not enable her to intuitively understand the junior and senior high school mathematics knowledge. Hence, Roland had to explain it to her whenever he had the spare time.



Of course, for Roland, who enjoyed teaching, imparting knowledge was a very interesting activity. Especially when he saw Scroll's expressions of shock or sudden realization after deep thought, he felt a special sense of achievement. However, Roland was clear that this also had to do with the student. Although Scroll was nearly forty years old, her magical power greatly slowed the aging of her appearance. Her cheeks were still firm and rosy, and her black hair was simply tied behind her head, giving her a mature and capable look. The fine crow's feet at the corners of her eyes did not detract from her overall beauty but instead highlighted her composed temperament. In a movie, she would definitely fit the role of an elegant and capable teacher. Now, he could make the "teacher" listen with wide-eyed astonishment, and he found this contrast quite satisfying.



While transcribing, Roland also pondered—what exactly was magic in this world?



It was omnipresent, whether in the depths of the Northern Slope Mine or the Impassable Mountain Range, from the Barbarian Land in the west to the Seawind County in the east, witches could use it to unleash all sorts of incredible powers. If magic were considered electricity, then witches were like electrical appliances with various functions. But obviously, it was much more unfathomable than electricity, more like an energy akin to the 'origin'.



For example, the Witch Union's Cara, Wendy said she could summon four types of magic serpents, each named Execution, Pain, Petrification, and Nothingness, with different venom effects. And then there was Nightingale, whose mist seemed to almost distort space. The manifestations of these abilities were incredibly diverse, and aside from the term origin, Roland could not think of a more fitting word.



To define the origin, it would probably be a set of rules that were universal and versatile. Einstein spent the latter half of his life committed to incorporating the four fundamental forces of the universe into a single theoretical framework, the so-called Theory of Everything. In some sense, what he was doing was searching for the origin. So, could there be a universal rule that applied in any universe?



This thought made Roland's imagination run wild. Could it be that the world he had traveled from also harbored such a force, only without witches as a conduit, leading it to be overlooked by people all along?



Regardless, Roland could only dream about it, as with the current level of technology, he was simply incapable of analyzing such power.

Therefore, pushing forward the development of industry and promoting the progress of civilization was his main task.

Perhaps one day, people could utilize this force directly without the aid of witches—a universal, super energy source that could be transformed into various effects. Just thinking about it was exciting.



"Your Highness?" Scroll couldn't help but speak out when she saw the prince lost in ecstasy.

"Ahem," Roland returned from his daydream with a cough, glanced at the candle that was nearly burned out, and said, "Let's end here for today."

"Yes." She bowed her head to take her leave, but her steps involuntarily slowed.

Roland didn't hear the door close for a long while and looked up in surprise to find her still lingering at the doorway. "Is there something else?"

"Your Highness..." Scroll hesitated for a moment, "I have a question I want to ask you."

"Go ahead." Roland nodded, set down his quill, and took a sip of water from his cup. These witches were all well and good, but they had one issue—they were too lacking in confidence. Like rabbits poking their heads out of a burrow, they would scurry back into the hole at the slightest rustle of grass, too frightened to come out again. He guessed her question would be something like why he was willing to shelter them or if he wasn't afraid of the Church's threats. Nightingale and Wendy had already asked him many times. However, since she had approached him in such a manner, he naturally had to answer seriously, to let them deeply feel that one should treat comrades as warmly as the spring breeze.



"You... Is it possible for you to marry a witch?"

"Pfft," Roland almost spit out the water he was drinking, "Uh, why do you ask that question?"

"I..." Scroll opened her mouth but couldn't come up with an answer.

Marry a witch? The first image that popped into Roland's head was that of Anna, from the moment he met her in the prison cage, her lake-blue eyes had left a deep impression in his heart. Witches were women who awakened from ordinary humans, they were extraordinary in abilities, and superior to ordinary people in both appearance and physique. If they were in modern society, they would undoubtedly be the center of attention. So, what was there to hesitate about? With that in mind—

He looked at Scroll and replied with a smile, "Why not?"

...

Wendy rubbed her sore shoulders and returned to her room.

Her overly heavy chest always brought her many troubles, especially when standing on top of the wooden shed of the "Littletown," where she had to hold her hands slightly back to maintain her balance against the wind.

Based on the first trial sailing, several improvements had been made to the "Littletown." For instance, a simple shed had been constructed where she stood, which could protect her from wind and rain and prevent sunburn. A ring of bark was hung around the hull to reduce collisions when docking. On both sides of the ship's gunwales, two concrete stumps had been added to facilitate the mooring of the ship with hemp ropes.



Her wind control ability had improved significantly after nearly a month of training. Now, the ship sailed more steadily, and its speed could be fast or slow depending on the wind. She had also learned to adjust the consumption of her magic power according to the existing wind, allowing her to sustain her powers for a longer period.



Nightingale finished her bath before Wendy and was already dressed in her nightgown, leaning against the headboard of the bed waiting for her.



However, Wendy was surprised to see an uncontrollable smile on the other's face.



"Did something good happen?" Wendy couldn't help but ask, but the other shook her head, saying nothing, her smile only deepening.



Wendy pouted her lips. Ever since their late-night talk, her mood had not been very high, only improving recently with the popularity of the game of Quart within the castle. Why was she suddenly all smiles today? Where had the emotionless, silent, and spectral assassin from their first encounter in Silver City gone?



Well, Wendy thought as she took off her clothes and stepped into the wooden tub filled with hot water, perhaps she had drawn a good card.
