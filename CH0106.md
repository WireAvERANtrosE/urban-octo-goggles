## Different Reasons
Scroll tapped on the door, and a voice quickly came from inside, "Come in."



She pushed the door open and entered. Anna was sitting at the table by the window, flipping through a thick book. The sunlight poured in from the window, elongating the silhouette of the woman. Her soft cheeks and neck were so white in the light that they were almost dazzling, and her flaxen hair covering her shoulders was nearly dyed a pale gold.



After spending nearly a week together, Scroll had basically come to understand the other's temperament, such as being straightforward, never beating around the bush, calm and quiet, and especially eager to learn... In short, it was rare for a child born to commoners to be as pure and peaceful in spirit as Anna.



"Aren't you going to play that... card game?" Scroll pulled up a stool and sat down next to Anna. Over the past two days, the sisters would rush back to the castle as soon as they finished their practice, crowding into Soraya's room to play the so-called Gwent, competing for each other's collected cards, seemingly never tiring of it. Even Nana Pine, who used to come to play with Anna every day, had become a rare sight after learning how to play. Unlike the previous days, it was always possible to find the little girl with the miraculous healing ability in the room.



"I want to read more books," Anna turned to the next page, "I don't have your abilities, so I have to spend more time on this."



She read almost anything from historical biographies to epic poetry, including various folk tales she heard about in the streets and alleys. As long as it was compiled into a book, she found it fascinating.



Scroll affectionately touched her head, "Don't rush, I remember everything and will tell you all about it."



This is the child who changed the fate of the survivors of the Mutual Aid Society, Scroll thought. If it weren't for her, Nightingale would not have gone to Border Town midway, nor would she have met the Fourth Prince of Greycastle, and all that followed would not have happened. In a way, she was the savior of all witches.



This was also the reason why Scroll had taken an immediate liking to Anna, who after witnessing the Book of Magic, quickly accepted her and showed great admiration, which Scroll found both amusing and touching. In the Mutual Aid Society, no sister had ever envied her abilities. In contrast, Anna's magical capacity was the largest Nightingale had ever seen among the witches, and her green flames, which could be controlled at will, were also extremely powerful in attack.



"Your hair has gotten a bit long," Scroll lifted Anna's bangs that almost covered her eyes, "Hasn't anyone ever cut your hair for you?"

She shook her head, "I always snipped it off myself."

Scroll immediately became interested, "Snipping it off is not very nice looking, let me trim it for you."

"You know how to do this?"

"Back at the Mutual Aid Society, I used to cut the hair for most of the sisters," Scroll said with a light laugh, "Wait a moment, I'll go get my tools."

She quickly came back holding a cloth bag. Unwrapping the layers of white cloth, inside lay a pair of bronze scissors. The scissors were V-shaped, with handles full of fine scratches, emanating a well-oiled luster, clearly they were often used. Before joining the Mutual Aid Society, Scroll made her living by cutting hair in the taverns of Seawindshire using these scissors. The bronze royals she saved up from this were spent on bread, and the rest were given to a one-legged old captain, who in return taught her to read and write, until he passed away from old age.

Scroll skillfully unfolded the white cloth and tied it around Anna's neck, beginning to trim her overgrown hair.

"I... have some questions I want to ask you."

"What is it?" Scroll's fingers danced, the scissors constantly opening and closing in her palm, making a crisp snipping sound. Locks of flaxen hair slid past her fingertips, drifting to the ground.



"The book you showed me yesterday, many of the stories recorded in it have the same ending. Must a prince always marry a princess?" 



Her hand paused slightly, the storybook was not a real book in the true sense, but a collection of folk tales she had heard sung by sailors over the past decade or so in the Fjords. However, the scroll had been selectively compiled, discarding any story without a happy ending, or any where the prince did not end up with the princess, eventually forming a book which she had materialized for Anna to read.



Knowing that the other party would certainly ask such a question after reading it, but when she really had to answer, she felt a twinge of reluctance.



"Mostly so, although there are also princes who marry the daughters of archdukes or dukes. For example, King Wimbledon III of Greycastle, his wife is the daughter of the Duke of Silver City."



After finishing, the scroll sighed inwardly. Wendy had mentioned Nightingale's feelings to her, and compared to the mature and calm shadow assassin, she was more concerned about Anna, who was growing increasingly close to His Highness. How important this woman was to His Highness was obvious to anyone. Whenever Anna was present, Roland's gaze would linger on her more. Her daily busy work was several times more than that of the other sisters. After Nightingale and Wendy's room was converted to a double occupancy, His Highness uniquely did not adjust Anna's room, explaining that it was so that if Nana stayed overnight in the castle, she could share a bed with Anna â€” he did not realize that as the master of this place, there was no need for him to explain.



Anna was the same, not saying much when with other witches, mostly a quiet listener. Only when by Roland's side would she become more proactive. If there was anything that could take her gaze away from her books, the scroll would bet it was definitely His Highness.



Regrettably, Roland was the fourth prince of the Kingdom of Greycastle, and the future king whom the witches would strongly support, while Anna was a witch.



The scroll could not possibly remind His Highness, so she had to come up with this method to subtly hint to Anna. She did not want to see a rift form between the two, nor did she want to witness a tragic story without resolution.



"Why?" Anna shook her head, seemingly trying to shake out the loose hair from her neck, "What if the prince does not like the princess or noble lady?"



"Uh..." Scroll did not expect her to ask such a question, "Then he would have no choice but to marry. Because the prince is very likely to become the king, and the marriage of a king is not a matter for him alone," she tried to recall the knowledge recorded in the books, "To stabilize the great nobles far on the borders of the kingdom, to appease the restless neighboring countries, or even to strike a good deal. But most importantly, the king must have an heir."



Anna did not continue to question further, which allowed Scroll to breathe a sigh of relief. Such matters could only be guided gradually, and she believed that one day the other party would understand. After finishing the haircut, Scroll smiled and scratched Anna's hair tips, "Not bad, it looks much more spirited."



"Thank you," Anna said, bowing her head.



"So, today's book..." Scroll thought for a moment and decided to summon a history book about the evolution of the Wolfheart royal family to reinforce the impression she had instilled today, "Let's choose a family biography."



As she was about to take her leave, Anna suddenly said while holding the Book of Magic, "I think Roland is not like the princes in those stories." Her voice was very certain and did not sound like she was trying to convince herself, "He only does what he wants to do, regardless of everything else."



"..." Scroll was taken aback, "Why?"



"If he were that kind of prince, he wouldn't have saved me."
