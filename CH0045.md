## Conspiracy (Part 1)
As the moon began to sink in the west, Herman Wimbledon saw the silhouette of the royal capital's walls flickering in the night.

After several months, he was finally back, he thought. The fatigue from the long journey seemed to dissipate, but he remained vigilant, reining in his mount and gesturing to his lieutenant to scout ahead.

If the plan hadn't changed, Scholar Aon should have already replaced the guards on the wall with his own confidants. After the lieutenant signalled, they would lower the side gate drawbridge.

He strained his eyes to watch ahead, fearing he'd miss the faint light.

The wait was not long, but to Herman, time seemed to freeze. Just as his eyelids were growing heavy and he could barely keep them open, he finally saw the flickering light in the distance—two flashes below, followed by three above, just as arranged in the plan. He sighed in relief and waved his men to move forward.

With this, he was but one step away from the throne.

Herman rode through the city wall's side gate, with his lieutenant by his side.

Behind him followed more than twenty cavalrymen, all silent, tugging at the reins, controlling their mounts to proceed at a slow pace.

The walls of the Greycastle capital were made from materials from Dragon Cliffs City. This grey-brown stone gave off a dark red sheen under the torches, as if soaked in blood. The wall itself was twenty feet wide, and to construct this unparalleled barrier, thousands of laborers, slaves, and masons died on the worksite.



The impregnable fortress that an army of ten thousand could not conquer, now easily traversed by himself, Herman thought, any flaw starts from the inside. For some reason, he thought of the New Holy City, with its seemingly more magnificent and indestructible walls, wondering if they too could be breached from within.



"Your Highness, I have been waiting for you here for a long time." Passing through the city gate, Scholar Baron and a team of men were waiting by the door. Seeing Herman appear, the scholar hurriedly dismounted and bowed deeply in salute.



Herman cast aside his distractions; he was probably too excited and couldn't help but let his thoughts wander, "You've done well. Have the guards at the palace been changed as well?"



"Your Highness, there was a slight mishap with the plan. The Silver Hand Knights, who had already agreed to serve you, were dispatched to the southern border three days ago. Now, we only had time to change the guards at the sleeping quarters."



Herman frowned; this meant that it was impossible to bring all of these twenty-plus men into the palace. The guards would not stop him, but they would not allow so many fully armed men to enter the royal precincts.



"No matter, just have two from the sleeping quarters' team follow me, and have the rest guard the entrance well, preventing outsiders from disturbing me," he hesitated for a moment before making up his mind. Although the plan had changed, the situation was still under control. His father's personal guards usually stayed in the outer room overnight, and as long as someone could hold them off for a moment, he was confident that he could cut them down with his sword.



Entering the inner city, everything seemed to have returned to how it was when he left. Even at night, he could still recognize every street. This was his territory, without a doubt. Everyone dismounted and hurriedly advanced towards the palace, dispersing according to the new plan upon reaching the entrance, lurking outside the palace. As Scholar Baron had said, the gatekeeper was surprised by the prince's night return to the capital, but after Herman bluffed about having urgent matters, they opened the door and let him in.



After all, he was the eldest son of the King of Greycastle, the legal first heir.



The prince and Scholar Baron passed through the garden and the great hall, and the castle ahead was where King Wimbledon III resided. The scholar raised the torch in his hand and waved it left and right, and immediately, guards emerged from the shadows and knelt on one knee before the two, "Your Highness, please follow me."



Herman sniffed, detecting the scent of blood.



Weren't all the guards of the sleeping chamber replaced? He scrutinized the guard by the light of the fire, indeed recognizing the man—a knight from an earl who supported his own ascension to the throne. This gave him some reassurance.



"What's happened, has someone entered the castle?"



"Your Highness, His Majesty summoned a maid this evening, and she noticed our switch," the other replied, "Rest assured, we have dealt with it."



A maid? His father had not touched a woman for a long time—not since the passing of his mother. Herman was somewhat surprised, but now was not the time to fuss over such trivialities. He nodded, said no more, and followed the guard into the castle, with the others trailing behind.



Herman could navigate the castle with his eyes closed. He had lived here for over twenty years and was well aware of all the secret passages and hidden doors. However, the purpose of his visit was to persuade his father to pass the throne to him; sneaking into the sleeping chamber secretly was pointless. He had to deal with the royal guards stationed outside, making his father fully aware of his predicament before they could sit down and discuss the succession seriously.



If he could not persuade him…



Herman Wimbledon took a deep breath, gestured for his men to halt, and drew the greatsword from his back.



The bronze doors at the end of the corridor were the only entrance to the sleeping chamber. Beyond those doors lay the antechamber, the last line of defense before the sleeping chamber, where two or three royal guards were usually stationed, ready to rush in and protect His Majesty at the first sign of trouble.



Herman first pushed the door open a crack, then shouldered it aside and quickly darted into the room, sword raised in a defensive posture—but the antechamber was eerily silent, not a soul in sight. Simultaneously, a strong scent of blood assaulted his nostrils.



A foreboding feeling flashed through his mind as he dashed straight for the royal bedroom.



What Herman saw next was beyond belief.



King Wimbledon III was sitting at the edge of the bed in his nightgown, leaning back against the pillows. His robe was open, revealing a sword hilt protruding from his chest, with blood flowing down his bulging belly and soaking the bedding.



Standing beside his father was none other than his own younger brother, Timothy Wimbledon.



"How... how could this be?" Herman froze in place.



"Just like you, brother," Timothy sighed, "I didn't want to do this."



He clapped his hands, and a group of ironclad warriors quickly flooded in from behind the door, encircling the crown prince. "This is all a chess game, and I had intended to play by the rules. Brother, do you know? Our little sister never planned to join this game from the start, and of course... neither did you. Otherwise, why would you have rushed to the King's City from thousands of miles away upon hearing Scholar Ahn's stellar prophecy? Honestly, if you hadn't come, I would have been at a loss."



"Scholar!"



He gritted his teeth and looked back—Scholar Ayong stepped back, spreading his hands, "I did not deceive you, 'The Star of Initiation is moving away from the Blazing Sun,' implies that the traveler has deviated from the correct path, but it also signifies falling from grace."



Now, Herman fully understood that from the very beginning, he had fallen into a meticulously designed trap. The bloody smell at the castle gates was probably not left by a maid, and the excuse for the Silver Knight's reassignment was also fabricated. But what drove him to despair was that Scholar Ayong, who had taught him to read and write since he was a child and had taken care of him for over ten years, ultimately chose the Second Prince—just like his father.



"Timothy Wimbledon! As sons of the same father, he poured so much effort into you alone, assigning the best territory to you, and yet you were the first to bite the hand that fed you! You're nothing but a demon from hell!"



A flicker of anger passed through Timothy's eyes, but it quickly disappeared. "Do you really think so? My dear brother, if this trip fails to persuade him to pass the throne to you, do you truly plan to give up? Stop deceiving yourself."
