## Battle of Redwater River Ambush (Part 2)
Compared to Lian, who observed from a distance, Sylvie saw everything more clearly.



Through the walls of the earthen house, she could see the soldiers busily working in an orderly fashion. Each one performed a single repetitive action, but when seven or eight were linked together, it became a complex whole, flowing smoothly like clouds and water. The paper bags and iron balls piled up in the compartment behind were continuously fed into that thick iron tube, then blasted out with the force of thunder.



Upon closer inspection, Sylvie noticed that the soldiers first lit a fuse at the end of the iron tube. The leaping sparks surged into the interior of the tube, igniting the paper bags that had been stuffed in first. The brilliance of the following moment made her squint involuntarily as the sparks rapidly expanded into an orange-red fireball, filling every crevice inside the tube. With nowhere else to go, the expanding flames wrapped around the iron ball and propelled it outward as if a giant hand had forcefully thrown it!



In the blink of an eye, the iron ball turned into a black shadow, shooting straight toward the sailboat in the river. Its force was so great that it drilled a fist-sized hole directly through the wooden hull pieced together by planks. Even though its speed was significantly reduced after piercing through the wood, its power was still formidable. An enemy trying to climb out of the cabin was hit in the middle and instantly split in two.



Sylvie had never seen such a scene before—without the need for sharp blades or sword edges, a simple round ball could split a person in half.



Because her vision was so close, she even felt as if the blood and viscera of those killed had splattered onto her own body. Subsequently, several more were hit by the iron balls, either having their limbs severed or their heads shattered. For a time, the cabin was filled with flowing filth and organs, red and white mingling together.



The witch suddenly felt a surge of nausea, and a wave of acid rushed up her throat.



"Ugh..." The scene in the cabin abruptly disappeared—her chaotic thoughts could no longer maintain the use of her power, forcing Sylvie to break the connection with the Eye of True Sight, and she bent her head to vomit.



"What's wrong?" Lian, startled, immediately came forward to support her, "Are you okay?"



His Highness the Prince also noticed her discomfort and handed her a handkerchief. "If you feel squeamish, then don't look for now, at least don't use your ability to observe at close range. Take a rest first."

"Thank you..." Sylvie took the handkerchief and wiped her mouth. "I'm fine."

This was probably the "unbelievable invention" that Maggie and Lightning had mentioned. However, at that time, not many people took their words seriously, or perhaps they didn't take them to heart at all. After all, it was hard to imagine such an astonishing weapon in their minds before witnessing it with their own eyes.

She looked back at the battlefield to see Timothy's fleet beginning to approach the shores—it was clear that they had also realized that the storm-like attack was coming from behind the low houses disguised as earthen mounds on the shore. But what they didn't know was that the fortifications arranged by Prince Roland were far from limited to just this one spot.

In a place far from the V-shaped defensive line, there were bunkers concealed by wild grass and vines, the distance between them just matching the length of the fleet's column formation. Unless they turned their ships around and retreated without hesitation, landing at any point would only result in falling into a pincer trap.

The soldiers in the bunkers also held long cylindrical iron rods, but what they fired were no longer round iron balls, but sharp, tailless crossbow bolts. They didn't seem as unstoppable as the iron balls, but the target had now changed to the unprotected flesh and blood of the enemy.

Sylvie guessed that the enemy probably wanted to wait until they landed and reformed before counterattacking, but the soldiers in the bunkers didn't give them the chance—just like the previous strikes, they didn't even need to show their heads, they just had to aim the weapons at the target and easily pull the trigger, and the crossbow bolts poured down on their opponents like rain.

Faced with this kind of weapon that fired rapidly and didn't need to be reloaded, the enemy didn't last long before they completely collapsed. Those who had disembarked tried to get back on the ships, while those standing at the ship's side waiting to disembark scattered in all directions. Amidst the severe rocking of the ships, gangplanks flipped into the water, and many of those who fell into the water were killed while trying to climb up the side of the ships—the scene was utter chaos.

"It's time," the Prince finally put down his spyglass and ordered Iron Axe, "Take the reserve troops to sweep the battlefield. If any of their leading knights are lucky enough not to have died in battle, try to capture them alive. I have some questions for them."



"Yes," the latter saluted.



Then he looked towards Sylvie, "You go with Iron Axe as well, don't let anyone slip away."



Sylvie nodded and followed the First Army commander out of the observation post. She suddenly understood why Prince Roland dared to openly shelter witches in a corner of the continent... With such powerful military forces at his control, even if the church dispatched the God's Punishment Army, they might not be able to defeat him easily. If Lady Tilly could also possess such weapons, perhaps the witches really might have a day when they could return to their homeland.



...



Watching the paralyzed sailboat on the riverbank, Roland breathed a sigh of relief.



When they intended to land and counterattack, the defeat was essentially sealed—a process of turning the ship's bow with poles and rowers is very slow, and the enemy probably did not choose to turn around and retreat under the bombardment because of this point. Rather than being passively beaten, it was better to quickly reach the shore and then organize a team to counterattack with drugs.



A solid iron ball from a twelve-pound field gun was unlikely to completely sink a wooden sailboat; even if the hull was riddled with holes, it would not affect its ability to continue floating on the water. Therefore, turning the ship's bow might result in severe losses, but one or two sailboats could always escape, while choosing to land meant total annihilation.



Compared to the last raid on the stronghold and the small town defense battle, the enemy did not even appear to mount an effective offensive this time—probably because the pills are usually controlled by the commanders, only to be distributed to the militia before a battle, and once ambushed, they were utterly unable to respond quickly.



It was not until evening that the work of clearing the battlefield was finally concluded.



Iron Axe and the personal guards brought in two captives into the camp.



Before Roland had a chance to ask, one of them began to shout loudly, "I am Sir Snacke, Your Highness, please allow me to write a letter to my family. They will surely deliver a handsome ransom."



"I am the second son of the Northern Border's Firm Shield family, Elvin Shed," said the other, "Respected Your Highness, I am also willing to pay ransom."



"So... you led this attack?" Roland raised an eyebrow.



"Uh, no, the captain was Sir Vincent, but he has already fallen," Sir Snacke twisted his body, "Your Highness, could you have your men untie my hands? During the period of redemption, I hope to receive normal treatment."



"I do not need ransom," the prince shook his head, "Your purpose in coming to the Western Territory, your plans, and Timothy's intentions... Tell me everything you know, and I might give you the 'treatment' you deserve."



"This... please forgive me, I cannot tell you," Sir Snacke hesitated for a moment.



"I have sworn loyalty to His Majesty Timothy," the young knight of the Firm Shield family also refused, "Such actions would violate my oath."



"Is that so," Roland said indifferently, "Take them away first."



After the guards left, he glanced at Iron Axe, "I heard that you once served as the chieftain's guard in Iron Sand City and are particularly adept at interrogating for intelligence?"

"Yes, Your Highness," Iron Axe responded, "Few can hide information from me."

"Good, these two are handed over to you for interrogation," Roland turned around, "Methods and means are not limited, as long as enough intelligence is obtained."

He was taken aback for a moment, "Then about the ransom..."

"I've said from the beginning, I do not need a ransom," Roland's tone was cold, "After the questioning is done, just treat them as if they died in battle."

This is the end those deserve who kidnap civilians and invade the Western Territory, he added in his mind.
