## Redwater River Ambush (Part 2)
Compared to Lotus who was watching from afar, Sylvie had a much clearer view.

Through the walls of the earth hut, she could see the soldiers busily working in an orderly fashion. Each person was performing a single repetitive motion, but when seven or eight of them worked together, it became a complex whole, flowing as smoothly as the clouds and water. The paper bags and iron balls stacked behind the partitions were continuously fed into that stout iron tube and then erupted forth with the force of thunder.

Upon closer inspection, Sylvie noticed that the soldiers first lit a fuse attached to the end of the iron tube. The jumping sparks darted into the interior of the tube, igniting the first paper bag that had been stuffed in. The brilliance of the following moment made her squint her eyes involuntarily. The sparks quickly expanded into an orange-red fireball, filling every crevice within the tube. The expanding flames, having nowhere else to go, wrapped around the iron ball and rushed outward, as if a giant hand had forcefully thrown it!

In the blink of an eye, the iron ball turned into a dark shadow, hurtling directly towards the sailboat in the river. Its force was so great that it drilled a fist-sized hole through the wooden planks of the ship's hull. Even though its speed was reduced after piercing through the wood, its power was still formidable. An enemy who was attempting to climb out of the cabin was struck midsection and instantly split in two.

Sylvie had never seen such a scene before—without the need for sharp blades or sword edges, a mere round ball could bisect a person.

Because her vision was too close, she even felt as if the blood and viscera of the slain had splashed onto her own body. Subsequently, several more people were hit by the iron balls, either having their limbs severed or their heads smashed. In an instant, the cabin was filled with flowing filth and a mix of red and white organs.

Suddenly, the witch felt a surge of nausea, and a wave of acid rushed up her throat.

"Ugh..." The scene in the cabin abruptly disappeared—the chaos in her thoughts could no longer maintain the use of her ability, forcing Sylvie to break the connection with her Eye of True Sight and bend over to vomit.

"What's wrong?" Lotus, startled, immediately came forward to support her, "Are you okay?"



His Highness the Prince also noticed her discomfort and handed her a handkerchief, "If you feel squeamish, then don't look, at least don't use your abilities to observe closely. Take a rest for now."

"Thank you..." Sylvie took the handkerchief and wiped her mouth, "I'm fine."

This was probably the 'incredible invention' that Maggie and Lightning had talked about. However, at that time, not many had taken their words seriously, or perhaps they hadn't paid much attention at all. After all, without witnessing it firsthand, it was hard to imagine such an astonishing weapon in one's mind.

She looked back at the battlefield, only to see Timothy's fleet beginning to approach the shores—clearly, they had also realized that this storm-like assault was coming from behind the low houses disguised as hillocks on the shore. What they did not know was that the fortifications Prince Roland had laid out were far from just this one spot.

At a distance farther away from the V-shaped defense line, there were bunkers hidden under wild grass and vines, and the distance between them matched the length of the fleet's column formation. Unless they turned their ships around without hesitation and retreated directly, landing at any point would only trap them in a pincer attack from both front and rear.

The soldiers inside the bunkers also held long iron rods, but what they fired were no longer spherical iron balls, but sharp, tailless crossbow bolts. They did not seem as unstoppable as the iron balls, but their targets were now the unprotected flesh and blood of the enemy.

Sylvie guessed that the enemy probably wanted to wait until they landed and regrouped before counterattacking, but the soldiers in the bunkers did not give them that chance—just like the previous strikes, they did not even need to show their heads, only needed to aim their weapons at the targets, and lightly pull the trigger for the bolts to rain down on their opponents like a downpour.

Faced with this kind of rapid-firing weapon that did not require winding, the enemy did not last long before they collapsed completely. Those who had disembarked tried to get back on the ships, while those who were waiting at the gunwale to disembark scattered in all directions. Amidst the severe rocking of the ships, the gangplanks flipped into the water, and many of the people who fell overboard were killed while trying to climb the sides of the ships, creating utter chaos.

"It's time," the Prince said, only then putting down his spyglass and giving orders to Iron Axe, "Take the reserve troops to sweep the battlefield. If their leading knights are lucky enough not to have died in battle, try to capture them alive. I have some questions for them."



"Yes," the latter saluted.



Then he looked at Sylvie, "You go with Iron Axe as well, don't let anyone get away."



Sylvie nodded and followed the First Army's Commander out of the observation post. She suddenly understood why Prince Roland dared to openly protect witches in a corner of the continent... With such powerful military force, even if the Church dispatched its God's Punishment Army, they might not be able to defeat him easily. If Lady Tilly could also have such weapons, perhaps the witches really could one day return to their homeland.



...



Watching the paralyzed sailboat by the riverbank, Roland let out a slight sigh of relief.



When they planned to land and counterattack, the defeat was basically sealed — turning the ship around with poles and oarsmen was a very slow process, and the enemy likely didn't choose to turn around and retreat under the bombardment because of this reason. Rather than getting pummeled for nothing, it was better to quickly approach the shore and organize a drug-taking team to counterattack.



A twelve-pound field gun's solid iron ball was unlikely to completely sink a wooden sailboat. Even if the hull was riddled with holes, it wouldn't affect its ability to continue floating on the water. Therefore, turning the ship might result in severe losses, but at least one or two sailboats could escape. Choosing to land, however, meant only one fate: the total annihilation of the forces.



Compared to the previous surprise attack on the fortress and the defense of the town, this time the enemy didn't even launch an effective offense — the pills were probably always controlled by the commanders, distributed to the militia just before battle, and once ambushed, they couldn't quickly respond.



It wasn't until the evening that the task of clearing the battlefield finally came to an end.



Iron Axe and the personal guards brought two prisoners into the camp.

Before Roland had a chance to speak, one of them began to shout loudly, "I am Sir Snack, Your Highness, please allow me to write a letter to my family, they will surely send a hefty ransom."

"I am the second son of the Northern Firm Shield family, Elvin Shed," the other man said, "Your respectful Highness, I am also willing to pay a ransom."

"So... you led this attack?" Roland raised an eyebrow.

"Uh, no, the captain was Sir Vincent, but he has fallen in battle," Sir Snack twisted his body, "Your Highness, could you have your men unbind my hands? I hope to be treated normally during the ransom period."

"I don't need a ransom," the prince shook his head, "the purpose of your visit to the Western Territory, your plans, as well as Timothy's intentions... tell me everything you know, and perhaps I will give you the 'treatment' you deserve."

"I... please forgive me, I cannot tell you that," Sir Snack hesitated for a moment.

"I have sworn loyalty to His Majesty Timothy," the young knight from the Firm Shield family also refused, "To do so would violate my oath."

"Is that so," Roland said, unconcerned, "take them away for now."



After the guards left, he glanced at Iron Axe, "I heard that you served as a clan guard in Iron Sand City and that you are particularly skilled at interrogating for intelligence?"

"Yes, Your Highness," Iron Axe replied. "Very few can keep secrets from me."

"Very well, these two are yours to interrogate," Roland turned around. "You're not limited by methods or means, as long as you can obtain enough information."

He was taken aback for a moment, "Then, about the ransom..."

"I said from the start, I don't need a ransom," Roland said coldly. "After the questioning, just treat them as if they died in battle."

That is the fate those who plunder civilians and invade the Western Territory deserve, he added in his mind.
