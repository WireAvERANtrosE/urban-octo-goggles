## Intelligence and the Messenger
In the inner city district of Greycastle, in a garden mansion.



Today is the scheduled day for intelligence exchange. Tassa leaned back in the armchair of the living room, waiting for the arrival of the members from the "Pigeon and Hat" acrobatic troupe. After the onset of autumn, the closing time for the inner city gate was moved up to the evening, so the secret meetings had to be held in the afternoon instead.



The first to always arrive at the mansion was Hill Fawkes.



He was dressed in a blue velvet jacket with an open collar, light grey tight pants, and deer skin boots, with a white bow tied around his neck, the very image of a nobleman. After greeting, he handed back the "History of Kingdom Customs" he had tucked under his arm to Tassa, who took the book and glanced at him with interest, "Finished reading?"



"Yes," Hill nodded, then hesitated, "Aren't you going to teach me some combat swordsmanship... or assassination techniques?"



"Why?"



"When the demonic plague broke out, you said you would train me to be a qualified intelligence officer," he scratched his head, "but so far, you've only given me some bizarre books to read."



"You mean 'History of Customs'?" Tassa poured himself a glass of wine and added two ice cubes, "This is not some bizarre book. It records the origins, traditions, family crests, as well as famous products of nobles from all over the kingdom. As an intelligence collector, you first need to be well-informed so you can roughly determine the value of news from different places. As for swordsmanship and assassination?" He laughed, "I have no intention of having you infiltrate an organization or delve deep into enemy territory for intelligence. That's both dangerous and time-consuming. With that effort, it would be better to spend a few more Gold royals to directly buy off informants."



"But not everyone can be bought," Hill insisted.



"And those watertight organizations are also very difficult to infiltrate; without ten or twenty years of effort, it's unlikely to penetrate them," Tassa shook his cup, took a sip of the ice wine, "A qualified intelligence officer only needs to do two things well: discern information and conceal oneself. The books I've given you are the foundation for discerning information, and as for the second point... as a member of the circus troupe, you should have more experience than me. For example, your outfit today is quite good."



... As Hill Fawkes pondered the meaning of these words, the clown and others also arrived at this secluded residence one after another.



"My lord, everyone has arrived."



"In that case, let us begin," Tassa put down his wine glass and spread out his notebook, "Who will start?"



"I'll start, my lord," the most burly Iron Mountain was the first to speak, "A new group of people has moved into the camp on the outskirts of the eastern district of the royal capital."



This news made the personal guard's eyebrows twitch slightly; he did not expect the first piece of intelligence to be bad news. Since the royal capital's Knights' Order suffered heavy losses, this camp established on the outskirts had become the station for the militia. All the rats, refugees, and criminals conscripted by Timothy would be crammed into the eastern camp before deployment. And just over a month ago, a militia group of over a thousand had been sent to the Western Territory, and now new manpower was being replenished?



"How many?"



"Currently only two or three hundred, most seem to be from the north... In addition, there are some rats from the Bloodsail Association, but compared to the first two times, there are not many rats willing to go."



"Keep a close watch on their movements. Report to me every time the camp increases by more than two hundred people," Tassa instructed.



"Yes, my lord."

These people have only one use, which is to be consumed as expendables after taking the pill. Now that Queen Clearwater has moved northward, and there is no resistance left in the southern territories, Timothy will undoubtedly continue to attack Prince Roland's domain. He must pass this information back to Border Town as soon as possible.

"Next, the clown brings you confidential intelligence, or rather, idle chatter after a few drinks," the clown said in an exaggerated tone, "I cannot verify the truth of this news, but those merchants talk about it so convincingly, let's just take it as the truth. They say that Grace Wimbledon's Black Sail Fleet has appeared in the Kingdom of Everwinter and has launched an attack against the Church, causing the siege of Wolfheart to collapse. They also plan to take advantage of the time before winter sets in to trade some scarce goods there."

Queen Clearwater went to Everwinter? Tassa was slightly surprised by this, but whether the news was true or false didn't matter. By choosing to head north and leave Greycastle, she had effectively given up her claim to the throne. "Is that all?"

"Well, I know this is a bit far from Greycastle," he stuck out his tongue, "I'll try to find out more useful information next time."

"Cough cough," Hill coughed twice, "My lord, there's a new lead on the task you entrusted to me. Timothy has built a new workshop in the inner city district and has recruited a lot of masons. The large quantity of saltpeter recently purchased has all been transported there. However, the security around the workshop is tight, and my people can't find out what the saltpeter is being used for."

"Oh?" Tassa's spirit was lifted, "They really transported the saltpeter into the workshop?"

"Indeed," Hill nodded, "I even personally tailed one of the carriages carrying goods."

This was extremely valuable intelligence. Having spent a long time by Prince Roland's side, he naturally knew that the invincible gunpowder was an alchemical item, with saltpeter being one of its main components. Ever since the saltpeter from the niter yards around the capital began to be bought up in large quantities, he had taken notice and tasked Hill Fawkes with investigating the destination and use of the goods.



Now that the other party has moved the saltpeter from the Alchemists' Association to the workshop, their intentions have become very clearâ€”they have shifted from conducting alchemical experiments to workshop production, which means they have mastered the formula for gunpowder. The priority of this piece of intelligence is even higher than the addition of new soldiers at the eastern suburbs camp.

"Well done," Tassa praised.

...

After the secret meeting ended, everyone left the mansion in batches.

Before leaving, Hila suddenly asked, "Sir, can what we are doing truly dethrone Timothy?"

"Of course," the guard replied with a smile, "haven't you seen the letter brought by the fleeing soldiers from Prince Roland? His throne is already tottering."

In the evening, when returning to the Underground Hand Tavern, Tassa encountered an unexpected familiar face: Shawn.

Like himself, he was also a personal guard of the fourth prince.

Entering the second-floor guest room and exchanging pleasantries for a moment, Tassa then drew the curtains and asked in a low voice, "How did you know I was here?"



"His Highness gave me a token to find Lady Margaret, who knows where you are," Shawn said, producing a sparkling, translucent red gemstone.



"Does he have a new assignment for me?"



"Not an assignment, a gift." Shawn walked to the window, parting the curtains slightly, and whistled. Three dun-colored birds flew into the room and landed on the table, cooing at him insistently. After he fed each bird some grains of wheat, they finally settled down.



It was the first time Tassa had seen such intelligent birds. "These are..."



"Messenger birds trained by witches," explained Shawn as he stroked the neck of one of the gray birds. "Unlike homing pigeons, they can travel back and forth between two places on their own, without the need to be carried away by a person and released to return to the nest. You only need to speak a specific command to the birds, and they will deliver the message to His Highness. If all goes well, you only need to wait one day to receive a reply from His Highness."
