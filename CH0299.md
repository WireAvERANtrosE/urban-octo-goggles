## Intelligence and the Messenger
Greycastle Royal Capital, the inner city's garden mansions.



Today is the scheduled day for intelligence exchange. Theo sits comfortably in the living room's armchair, waiting for the arrival of the members of the "Pigeon and Top Hat" acrobatic troupe. After the onset of autumn, the closing time for the inner city gates was moved up to the evening, and secret meetings had to be shifted to the afternoon accordingly.



The first to always arrive at the mansion is Hill Fox.

He is dressed in a blue velvet open-necked coat, light grey tight trousers, and deerskin boots, with a white bow tie neatly knotted around his neck, the very picture of a noble. After greeting, he hands over the "History of Kingdom's Customs" tucked under his arm back to Theo, who takes the book and looks at him with interest, "Finished reading?"



"Yes," Hill nods, then hesitantly adds, "Aren't you going to teach me some combat swordsmanship... or assassination techniques?"



"Why?"



"When the demonic plague broke out, you said you'd train me to be a qualified intelligence officer," he scratches his head, "But up to now, you've only given me some odd and ancient books to read."



"You mean 'History of Customs'?" Theo pours himself a glass of wine and adds two ice cubes, "This is not some odd and ancient book. It records the origins of nobles from all over the kingdom, traditions, family crests, and famous local products. As an intelligence gatherer, you first need to be well-informed to roughly determine whether information from various places is valuable or not. As for swordsmanship and assassination?" He chuckles, "I have no intention of having you infiltrate a certain organization or delve deep into enemy lines for intelligence. That's both dangerous and time-consuming. With that effort, it's better to spend more Gold royals to directly bribe informants."



"But not everyone can be bribed," Hill insists.



"And those watertight organizations are equally hard to infiltrate. Without a good ten to twenty years, it's unlikely to penetrate them." Theo swirled his glass, sipping some ice wine, "A qualified intelligence officer only needs to do two things: discern information and conceal oneself. The books I've given you are the basis for discerning information, and as for the second point... as a member of a circus troupe, you should have more experience than I do. For example, your outfit today is quite good."



As Hill Fawkes pondered the meaning of these words, the clowns and others also gradually arrived at this secluded residence.



"Sir, everyone has arrived."



"In that case, let's begin," Theo set down his cup and spread out his notebook, "Who will start?"



"I'll begin, sir," the most burly man, Iron Axe, spoke first, "A new batch of people has moved into the camp on the outskirts of the eastern district of the King's City."



This piece of news caused the royal guard's eyebrows to twitch slightly; he hadn't expected the first piece of intelligence to be unwelcome. Ever since the King's City Knights had suffered heavy losses, the barracks established in the suburbs had become the garrison for the militia. All the rats, refugees, and criminals conscripted by Timothy were stuffed into the eastern camp before being sent off to battle. And just over a month ago, a militia of over a thousand men had been dispatched to the Western Territory, and now there were new reinforcements?



"How many?"



"Currently only two to three hundred, most seem to be from the North... In addition, there are some rats from the Bloodfang Association, but compared to the first two times, there are not many rats willing to go."



"Keep a close watch on their movements. Report to me whenever the camp grows by more than two hundred," Theo instructed.



"Yes, my lord."



These people only had one use, which was to consume the pills and serve as expendable items. Now that Queen Clearwater had gone north, there were no more forces of resistance in the south, and Timothy would undoubtedly continue his assault on Prince Roland's territory. He must send this information back to Border Town as soon as possible.



"The clown now presents you with some confidential intelligence, or rather, idle chatter after drinking," the clown said with an exaggerated tone, "I cannot verify the truth of this news, but it's spoken of with such certainty by those merchants that we might as well take it as fact. They say that Grace Wimbledon's Black Sail Fleet has appeared in the Kingdom of Everwinter and has launched an attack on the Church, causing the siege of Wolfheart to collapse. They also plan to take advantage of the time before winter sets in to trade some scarce goods there."



Queen Clearwater went to Everwinter? Theo was slightly surprised, but whether the news was true or not didn't matter. Her choice to head north away from Greycastle was tantamount to giving up her claim to the throne. "Is that all?"



"Well, I know this is a bit far from Greycastle," he stuck out his tongue, "next time I will inquire about more useful news."



"Cough cough," Hill coughed twice, "My lord, there is a new lead on the task you entrusted to me. Timothy has built a new workshop in the inner city area and recruited a lot of masons. The large quantity of saltpeter he has recently purchased is all being transported there. However, the workshop is heavily guarded, and my people are unable to find out the use of that saltpeter."



"Oh?" Theo perked up, "They really brought the saltpeter into the workshop?"



"Indeed," Hill nodded, "I have even personally trailed a carriage that was transporting the goods."



This was indeed a piece of extremely valuable information. Having stayed by Prince Roland's side for a long time, he naturally knew that the indestructible gunpowder was an alchemical item, and its main ingredient was saltpeter. Ever since the saltpeter from the nitrate fields around the capital had been massively purchased, he had taken note of this and arranged for Hill Fox to investigate the destination and use of the goods.



The other party has now moved the saltpeter from the Alchemist Association to the workshop, which makes their intentions very clearâ€”they have transitioned from alchemical experimentation to workshop production, indicating that they have mastered the formula for gunpowder. This piece of intelligence is even higher priority than the additional troops at the eastern suburbs camp.



"Well done," Theo commended.



...



After the secret meeting concluded, everyone left the mansion in separate groups.



Before departing, Hill suddenly asked, "My lord, by doing all this, can we really overthrow Timothy from the throne?"



"Of course," the personal guard said with a smile, "haven't you seen the letter sent by Prince Roland through the fleeing soldiers? His throne is already teetering."



In the evening, upon returning to the Underhand Tavern, Theo encountered an unexpected acquaintance: Shawn.



Like himself, he was also a personal guard of His Highness, the Fourth Prince.



Entering the second-floor room and exchanging pleasantries for a moment, Theo then drew the curtains and asked in a low voice, "How did you know I was here?"



"His Highness gave me a token to find Lady Margie, as she knows your whereabouts," Shawn said, taking out a crystal clear red gemstone and shaking it.



"Does he have a new task for me?"



"Not a task, a gift." Shawn smiled as he walked over to the window, pulled back a slit of the curtain, and blew a whistle. Three grey-brown birds flew into the room and landed on the table, cooing at him incessantly. After feeding each bird some grains of wheat, they finally settled down.



Theo had never seen such intelligent birds before. "These are..."



"Messenger birds trained by witches," Shawn explained as he stroked the neck of one of the grey birds. "Unlike homing pigeons, they can travel back and forth between two places on their own without needing to be taken away by someone and released to return to their nest. You just have to say a specific command to the birds, and they will deliver the message to His Highness. If all goes well, you only need to wait one day to receive a reply from His Highness."
