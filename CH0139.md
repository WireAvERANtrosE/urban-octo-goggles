## Devil's Power
Barov returned to his office in the City Hall and immediately shut the door tightly behind him.

Good heavens, he touched the Divine Stone of Judgement on his chest, His Highness must truly be possessed by the devil. He had had his suspicions before, but now he was almost certain that the person he had just spoken with could not possibly be the Fourth Prince.

It was understandable for someone to undergo a drastic change in personality or to act eccentrically, but to suddenly understand things he had never come into contact with before, to grasp knowledge he had never heard of? Such occurrences were only found in mythological tales where deities possessed mortals to lead humanity out of dire straits. Since when did devils start doing such things?

If Roland Wimbledon managed his territory as they did in the capital (although that would be very difficult), Barov wouldn't be surprised. Everyone said the Fourth Prince was ignorant and unlearned, but one could feign their character, and perhaps someone had secretly taught him how to manage a city, or even a country.

However, the ideas and plans spoken by the prince were unheard of to the assistant minister. He had been mixed up in the Capital City Hall for twenty years, serving as an underling to the Minister of Finance, and he was very knowledgeable about the structure and operation of the City Hall. The ministers were in charge of various functions and did not account for each other's affairs outside of private agreements.

After the king issued an edict, the minister who received the order would delegate it to those under him to carry out. Each minister had their own forces, and their styles of handling matters were also different. For example, the Ironheart Knight responsible for the defense of the capital of Greycastle controlled hundreds of patrolling troops and mercenaries and also had significant influence over the shady underground organizations in the city. When handling matters, he would charge in with his men, and the criminals he targeted, even if they were nobles, found it hard to remain in the city. They had to either leave the capital or wait to be thrown into prison.

This was not only the case in the capital but in other cities as well.

Therefore, to become a lord or a subordinate of the king, one must first be a noble with significant family and business assets.

Without enough money and provisions to recruit subordinates, could one possibly handle everything on their own? And the more subordinates one had, the more they would be valued by those above—because it was well understood that having more people made things easier to handle.

But the prince's approach completely subverted Barov's perception. Whether it was a minister or a minister's subordinate, everyone was recruited by the City Hall and paid accordingly, which meant that even if a minister was no longer there, a new one could simply be replaced, or even someone from below could be promoted.
This was a brand new system, and Barov was certain that the prince aimed to create a political system drastically different from that of the upper echelons of Greycastle.
Perhaps some would think this was nothing but Roland's whimsical fantasy, or the presumptuousness of an amateur? But the assistant minister did not think so. He picked up a quill and meticulously noted down His Highness's requirements one by one.
Looking at these plans, they were interconnected, with every detail taken into account.
First and foremost was management down to eating, drinking, and the necessities of life.
Barov naturally knew that the stronger the control over the people, the faster the lord's orders could be carried out. However, this would significantly increase the number of people to manage. First, where would one find so many literate people? Second, the additional salaries would be a heavy burden for the lord's subordinates, and not many were willing to undertake such a task.
Then, looking at the other two items from His Highness, recruiting civilians into the City Hall and educating all civilians.
His fingers brushed over these two lines of text, and he couldn't help but shiver.
If both of these were realized by His Highness, what would Border Town become?

Every commoner can read and write, and the City Hall can find a large number of suitable personnel whenever it wants to expand its scale. This in turn will promote the popularization of education—if one receives education, there is a chance to enter the City Hall and get a well-paid position, which also brings about a rise in social status. In just one or two years, everyone will actively seek education, and even if they can't achieve it themselves, they will think about sending their children to the academy.

Moreover, as mentioned earlier, all the salaries of the employees are paid by the City Hall—that is, by Lord Roland. The commoners no longer need to spend a single Bronze royal to build their own team, which completely breaks the restriction that only nobles are qualified to be administrative officers.

Without a doubt, only a devil could come up with such a shocking and unconventional system.

Barov took a deep breath, clutching the Divine Stone of Judgement on his chest, and now only one question remained: do devils have a kind side too?

If someone were to call Roland an evil man, he would be the first to disagree.

The actions of the Fourth Prince, in his eyes, could even be considered the deeds of a wise king. Even the legends of kings in the history books did not care for every subject's life and death as he did. He stayed with his people in Border Town, spent a lot of money to buy food, and ensured everyone's safety through the Evil Months; he brought the devil's technology and equipment for the town's development; even the witches, the minions of the devil, were using their abilities to improve the lives of the people.

Barov suddenly felt that even if Roland became the king of Greycastle, it might not be such a bad thing after all.

Recalling his father's teachings to him—do not speak what should not be spoken, do not ask what should not be asked—he decided to keep his findings to himself for now. Since it was a devil, there would always be a clash with the Church eventually, and if the situation was not right, he could still act as a revealer and witness hidden within the devil's camp.

He rang the bell, summoning the newly joined City Hall member, Seine Dali.

Compared to those foolish and arrogant knights, this young man from the Wolfheart family was already outstanding, even though he still had a bit of a knight's pride, at least he was willing to listen to his own instructions.
"Teacher, do you need something?" he asked as he entered and bowed.
"His Highness is setting up a new ministry to oversee crop cultivation and supervision, and needs two apprentices to assist with the record-keeping," Barov repeated Roland's request, "Additionally, go to the city hall archives and pick out ten people who meet the requirements, then screen them again. Although they are commoners, His Highness has insisted on incorporating them into the city hall. If any of them perform exceptionally well, they might even become the head of the Ministry of Agriculture. Ah..." he sighed, "You follow them and keep records of the results for now, and after the spring plowing is over, I'll call you back."
"Teacher, just selecting two people will suffice," he said confidently, "I am also well-versed in this area."
"You?" Barov was taken aback.
"Yes! Before I became a knight, I helped my father manage the farm and am very knowledgeable about wheat cultivation," said Seine, pausing, "However, when His Highness asked me if I had any other expertise, I didn't mention it... because I was worried at the time that he would send me to work in the fields with the serfs."
Barov was delighted. Educated and knowledgeable about farming, this man was the indisputable choice for a manager in the Department of Agriculture, even if commoners were added. As it stood, Seine was on his side, and if he became a manager, it was as though he himself had influence over the Department of Agriculture.
"Very well," he turned this consideration into a promise of benefits, "Work hard, and you might climb to an even higher position than before."
After Seine left, Barov leaned back in his chair and let out a gentle breath.

Knowing that His Highness is a devil, he became even more determined to cling to power. Devils always have an appreciation for those with great ambition; this is a common record in mythological biographies. As for him, whether it's power bestowed by the king or by the devil, both are equally sweet.
