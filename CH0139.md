## The Devil's Power
Barov returned to his office in the City Hall and immediately shut the door tightly behind him.



"My God," he touched the God's Punishment Stone on his chest, "His Highness must really be possessed by a devil." He had had his suspicions before, but now he could almost be certain that the person he had just spoken with could not have been the Fourth Prince.



A change in personality or odd behavior were understandable, but suddenly grasping matters he had never come into contact with, mastering knowledge he had never heard of? Such occurrences were only found in mythological tales where deities possessed mortals to lead humanity out of predicaments. Since when did devils start doing the same?



Had Roland Wimbledon operated his territory in the same fashion as the King's City (although that would be difficult), Barov would not have been surprised. Everyone said that the Fourth Prince was ignorant and incompetent, but personality could be feigned. Perhaps someone had secretly taught him how to manage a city, or even a country.



However, the ideas and plans mentioned by the prince were entirely unheard of to the Ministerial Assistant. He had been in the King's City Hall for twenty years and, as an aide to the Finance Minister, he was very familiar with the structure and operation of the City Hall. The ministers were in charge of various functions and, except for private agreements, normally no one answered to anyone else.



After the King issued a decree, the minister who received the order would delegate the task to his subordinates. Each minister had their own power base and their own unique style of operation. For instance, the Steel Heart Knight in charge of the defense of Greycastle's King's City controlled hundreds of patrollers and mercenaries, and also had significant influence over the city's shady underground organizations. His approach to business was to charge in forcefully with his men, and the criminals he set his sights on, even if they were nobles, would find it difficult to remain in the city. They either had to leave the King's City or wait to be thrown into jail.



It was not just the King's City, other cities were the same.



Therefore, to become a subordinate of a lord or a king, one must first be a noble with considerable family wealth and businesses.



Without sufficient money and provisions to recruit followers, could one really accomplish anything by oneself? And the more followers one had, the more valued they were by those above—because it was well understood that more hands made for lighter work.



But the prince's actions completely subverted Barov's conception. Whether it was a minister or the minister's subordinates, everyone was recruited by the City Hall and paid a salary. This meant that if a minister was no longer present, a new one could simply be replaced, or even directly promoted from below.



This was a completely new system, and Barov was certain that what the prince wanted to create was a political system entirely different from that of the upper echelons of Greycastle.



Maybe some would think this was just Roland's flight of fancy, or the presumption of an outsider? But the Assistant Minister did not think so; he picked up a quill and meticulously recorded the prince's requests on paper.



Look at these plans, they were interconnected, considering every single detail.



First on the list was management down to the basics of life.



Barov knew well that the stronger the control over the people, the quicker the lord's commands were carried out. But this also greatly increased the number of managers needed. First, where would one find so many literate people? Second, the additional salaries were a heavy burden on the lord's subordinates, and not many people were willing to undertake this.



Then look at the other two items from His Highness: recruiting civilians into the City Hall and providing education to all citizens.



When his finger brushed over these two lines of text, he couldn't help but shudder.



If both of these were realized by His Highness, what would Border Town become?



Any civilian can read and write, and the City Hall can find a large number of suitable personnel anytime they wish to expand. This point will, in turn, promote the spread of education—receiving education means there's a chance to enter the City Hall and obtain a well-paid position, which also brings about an elevation in social status. I fear that in just a year or two, everyone will actively seek education, and even if they can't achieve it themselves, they'll consider sending their children to the academy.



Furthermore, all employee salaries mentioned before are paid by the City Hall—that is, by Lord Roland. Civilians need not spend a single bronze royal to build their own team, which essentially breaks the restriction that only nobles have the capital to serve as administrative officials.



Without a doubt, only a devil could conceive such a shocking and unconventional system.



Barov took a deep breath, clutching the God's Punishment Stone on his chest. Now only one question remained: can devils also be kind?



If anyone were to call Roland an evil man, he would be the first to disagree.



The actions of the Fourth Prince, in his eyes, could even be considered the acts of a wise king. Even the legendary kings in the history books did not care for each of their subjects' lives and deaths as he does. Staying with his people in Border Town, spending a fortune on food so that everyone could safely get through the Months of Demons; bringing the devil's technology and equipment for the town's development; even the witches, the minions of the devil, were using their abilities to improve the lives of the people.



Suddenly, Barov felt that even if Roland were to become the king of Greycastle, it might not be such a bad thing after all.



Recalling his father's teachings—to not speak out of turn and not to ask unnecessary questions—he decided to keep his findings to himself for now. Since this involved the devil, there would eventually be a clash with the Church, and if things went awry, he could serve as an undercover exposer and witness within the devil's camp.



He rang the bell, summoning the newly joined member of the City Hall, Sonny Dali.



Compared to those foolish and arrogant knights, this young man from the Wolfheart family was already exceptional. Although he still had some of the pride typical of a knight, he was at least willing to follow instructions.

"Teacher, do you need something?" He asked as he entered and bowed.

"His Highness is forming a new department to oversee crop cultivation and supervision, and needs two apprentices to assist with record-keeping," Barov repeated Roland's request, "Additionally, go to the City Hall archives and pick out ten suitable candidates for further screening. Although they are commoners, His Highness is determined to incorporate them into the City Hall. If any of them perform exceptionally well, they might even become the head of the Agriculture Department. Ah..." he sighed, "For now, follow them and keep track of the results. After the spring plowing is over, I'll call you back here."

"Teacher, just selecting two individuals will suffice," he said confidently, "I am also quite familiar with this area."

"You?" Barov was momentarily taken aback.

"Yes! Before I became a knight, I helped my father manage our farm and am very knowledgeable about wheat cultivation." Sonny paused, "However, when His Highness asked if I had any other special skills, I did not mention it... because I was worried that he would send me to work in the fields alongside the serfs."

A feeling of delight arose in Barov's heart. Educated and knowledgeable about farming, this made him an undeniable candidate for the head of the Agriculture Department even if commoners were to join. As it stood, Sonny was on his side, and his becoming the head would mean that Barov himself would effectively have influence over the Agriculture Department.

"Very good," he turned these considerations into a promise of potential benefits, "Do well, and you might climb to an even higher position than before."

After Sonny left, Barov leaned back in his chair and exhaled softly.



Since he knew that His Highness was a devil, he was all the more determined to cling to power. Devils always have a certain admiration for the ambitious, as is often recorded in mythological biographies. And for him, whether the power was granted by the king or by the devil, it was equally sweet.
