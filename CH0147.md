## Embassy
Alesia never thought that one day she would also become a member of an envoy.



After all, when the Church dispatched envoys, the team members were always elite warriors, not only well-rounded in both literature and martial arts but also had to have appearances that could represent the face of the Church. She was very confident in her combat skills and church etiquette, but as for her appearance... How attractive could a woman be who had been running around on the front lines all year round, swinging a greatsword all day? Thinking about this made her feel somewhat uncomfortable.



Priestess Mira said that they were going to a small town in the western border of the Kingdom of Greycastle to negotiate an incident of royal collusion with witches. In addition to the leading priest, the envoy consisted of ten members of the Judgement Army, one of whom was the cold-faced captain whom she had met once on the Hermes Plateau.



But now it seemed that even when not in battle, he still maintained a cold expression. Just standing beside him, Alesia felt the temperature drop considerably.



On the other hand, Priestess Mira was the complete opposite. She was over forty years old, with a pair of wise eyes. She was always smiling when talking about interesting church stories, experienced and knowledgeable, warm yet dignified. Even in front of the Archbishop, her grace remained undiminished. Alesia had heard more than once that she was very likely to become a candidate for the next bishop.



What surprised the female knight was that, as a civil officer, Mira's horsemanship was not much inferior to the other members of the Judgement Army. Over the past two days, she had been leading the team at the front, from forested mountains to town paths, she could keep the horses moving at a steady pace while minimizing their exhaustion. This skill could only be mastered by members of the Judgement Army who had undergone long-term equestrian training.



"Aren't we heading south?" someone in the team asked after they left the territory of Hermes and entered the Kingdom of Greycastle.



"No, Border Town is too far from us. If we take the land route, I don't want to get saddle sores," Mira waved her hand, "We'll head east first, to the Silent Town. There's a river there that leads to Redwater City. From Redwater City to Longsong Stronghold is quite quick."



"When did you join the Church?" Alesia asked curiously, "Not only do you know various interesting stories of the Holy City, but you also understand the secular world so well."



"Twelve years ago, I was exactly thirty years old," Mayne replied.

"That's quite late," she exclaimed in surprise. "As far as I know, the older one gets, the harder it becomes to comprehend the divine teachings. Yet you've managed to rise from a believer to a bishop within merely ten years, which is simply inconceivable."

"Yes," Mayne smiled, "that is the charm of the Church. You see, I was originally a merchant's daughter, traveling with my father among the Four Kingdoms. We would carry ordinary goods from one place to another, and their prices would differ by several times. For example, the emerald green corals from Seawind County, when bought directly from the local fishermen, would only cost twenty to thirty silver royals per piece. If you put them into water tanks and brought them to the palace of the Kingdom of Everwinter, they could be exchanged for a gold royal. The ones with good color and uniform branches could even sell for more than five. I often wondered, why does the same item have two different values?"

"Because... rarity is the measure of value?" Agatha suggested.

"That's what I thought at first," the bishop nodded, "but then something happened that changed my mind. A noble in the capital secretly harbored a witch who could change temperatures. He devised various methods, finally managing to breed the Seawind County corals in the cold climate of the capital of Everwinter. He transformed the basement of his courtyard into a huge pool, with a skylight at the top for sunlight, and he could harvest once a year, producing more each time than what we could in ten voyages. My father would only make the journey once a year. Consequently, the market was flooded with emerald green corals, not only sold to the palace but also to other nobles. If rarity determined price, the cost of the emerald green corals should have continuously fallen."

"Yet, merely two years later, the palace began to refuse those lower-priced emerald green corals, claiming they were imitations. The corals my father sold not only did not reduce in price, but they actually doubled. As for the noble who hid the witch, he was caught by the Church, charged with harboring a witch, and burned at the stake alongside her. But I know that the corals he bred were not imitations; they were no different from the ones my father transported."

"The concept of 'rarity is the measure of value' is not wrong per se, but there are many other factors that determine the price of goods. This is just the simplest example—because the palace of Everwinter designated the emerald green coral as a symbol of luxury, artificially defining its value. When more corals appeared, it challenged the decree of the royal family, and thus, on the day of the execution, the Queen even celebrated grandly. Do you think, these goods... are they not like us mortals?"

"Like... what?" Agatha had not yet fully grasped the concept.

"Like the people under the king's authority, child," Mayne said, each word deliberate, "from birth, we are assigned a price, and this price does not reflect our true value. We are just like these emerald green corals; although identical, some are priced cheaply, while others are unattainably expensive."



"Unattainable... you mean the nobility."



"Nobility is the coral of the Eternal Winter Palace," the priest said with a smile, "they are born no different from us, with a pair of hands, a pair of feet, a pair of eyes, and a mouth. However, they are artificially deemed of the highest value, and this inequality is not determined by their own abilities but by the decree of royal authority. That is why I joined the Church, for at least in the New Holy City of Hermes, one's birth does not limit their value. If we could transform the entire continent into the Church's ultimate Holy City, the so-called Divine Kingdom, it would be just like that."



"You speak so wonderfully!" Ashes nodded repeatedly, her heart stirred with excitement. It would be a beautiful sight indeed if a divine kingdom on earth as described by Mia could truly be established, where people are not differentiated by bloodline, and there are no serfs or slaves.



"A Divine Kingdom? Hmph... how many more people do they want to turn into cold-blooded monsters?" The grim-faced captain of the Judgement Army shook his reins and stepped forward, "Priest, how much do you know about the God's Punishment Army?"



"Hey, you—" Ashes was about to call him out for his rudeness but was stopped by Mia.



"The God's Punishment Army consists of the Church's most powerful warriors, transformed from the Judgement Army who are steadfast in faith, willing to sacrifice, and brave and fearless."



"The most powerful, indeed, and it is true that they need the Judgement Army to transform, but what they transform into are not warriors, but a group of emotionless monsters!" After dropping these cold words, he spurred his horse to the front of the column.



"What an impertinent man!" Ashes said resentfully. She had thought highly of him when she saw him in Hermes, composed in the face of danger, possessing both the steadiness of a commander and the bravery of a warrior. How could he have become such a person now?



"It doesn't matter, he is just troubled," Mia shook her head, "In building the divine kingdom on earth, setbacks and sacrifices are inevitable... but at least we do so willingly."



When the party arrived at the next town, it was already late, and the priest led the delegation to the church to rest. After everyone had their meal, they went back to their rooms to sleep, but Aletheia followed the Judge Army Captain in the corridor and stopped him.

"Lord Mayne is our leader, what do you mean by doing that? Have you forgotten all the church's rules and regulations?"

"You're called Aletheia, right?" He remained silent for a moment before he spoke.

"Correct, I am now a Judge Army Captain like you. Back in the Evil Months, I had asked for your name, but you said nothing. Can you tell me your name now?"

"Abrams," he said expressionlessly, "As for why I did what I did... Do you have any brothers or sisters?"

"No." Aletheia suddenly remembered that he had once said his elder brother was a member of the God's Punishment Army.

"I do. He and I grew up together in the church, and we knew each other as if we were the same person. Later, he volunteered for the God's Punishment Army transformation, and I never saw him again—The Judge told me that his transformation was very successful, and that he was now out on the church's special mission. I was genuinely happy for him." He paused, "Until one day, I saw him again in the great cathedral, I called out his name, went forward to embrace him, guess what I saw?" A pained look crossed Abrams's face, "A stranger. It was as if he didn't see me at all, just walked straight by me, his eyes devoid of any life, staring straight ahead, his movements not at all human."

"..." A chill rose behind Aletheia, she wanted to shout out that the other party was lying, but when she opened her mouth, she couldn't say a word.

"The God's Punishment Army is stripped of human emotions, nothing more than a moving corpse." He pushed past the stunned Aletheia, not looking back as he walked to his own room.
