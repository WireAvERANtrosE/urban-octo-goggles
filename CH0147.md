## Embassy
Alesia had never imagined that one day she would become a member of an envoy group.
After all, when the Church dispatched envoys, the members of the team were always elite warriors, not only skilled in both civil and military affairs, but also possessing appearances that represented the Church's image. She was very confident in her combat skills and ecclesiastical etiquette, but when it came to her looks... How attractive could a woman who constantly toiled on the front lines, swinging a great sword all day, be? Thinking about this made her feel somewhat uncomfortable.
Priestess Mira said that they were heading to a small western town in the Kingdom of Greycastle to negotiate a blasphemous incident involving the royal family harboring witches. In addition to the leading priest, the envoy group consisted of ten soldiers from the Judgement Army, one of whom was the cold-faced captain she had met once at the Hermes Plateau.
However, it now seemed that even when not in battle, he still kept a stern face. Just standing beside him made Alesia feel as if the temperature had dropped considerably.
Priestess Mira, on the other hand, was the complete opposite. She was over forty years old with a pair of wise eyes. She always talked about the Church's interesting stories with a smile, knowledgeable and enthusiastic without losing grace; even in front of the Archbishop, her charm did not diminish. Alesia had heard more than once that she was very likely to become a candidate for the next bishop.
What surprised the female knight was that, as a civil officer, Mira's riding skills were not much different from the other members of the Judgement Army. In the past few days, she had been leading the group at the forefront, from forested mountains to town trails, managing to keep the horses at a steady pace while reducing their fatigue. This kind of skill could only be mastered by members of the Judgement Army who had undergone long-term horse riding training.
"Aren't we heading south?" someone in the group asked after they left the territory of Hermes and entered the Kingdom of Greycastle.
"No, Border Town is too far from us; I don't want to get saddle sores by taking the land route," Mira waved her hand and said, "We'll head east first, to Valley Town. There's a river there that flows to Redwater City. From Redwater City to Longsong Stronghold is quite fast."
"When did you join the Church?" Alesia asked curiously, "You not only know all sorts of interesting stories about the Holy City, but you also have such a good understanding of the secular world."

"Twelve years ago, I was just thirty years old at that time," Mayra replied.
"So late," she exclaimed in surprise. "As far as I know, the older one gets, the harder it is to comprehend the teachings of the divine. Yet you managed to advance from a believer to a priest in just ten years, which is simply unbelievable."
"Yes," Mayra smiled, "that's the charm of the Church. I was, originally, a merchant's daughter, traveling with my father among the four major kingdoms, transporting ordinary goods from one place to another. The price would multiply several times over. For example, the emerald corals from Fjords, when bought from the local fishermen, would only cost twenty to thirty Silver Royals each. Packed into water tanks and brought to the palace of the Kingdom of Everwinter, they could be exchanged for one Gold Royal. If they were of good quality and had a uniform branch shape, they could even sell for five or more. I often wondered, why does the same item have two different values?"
"Because... rarities are cherished?" Alesia ventured.
"That's what I thought at first," the priest nodded. "But then something happened that changed my view. A noble in the capital secretly hoarded a witch who could change temperatures. He used various methods and finally managed to cultivate corals from Fjords in the cold capital of Everwinter. He transformed his courtyard's basement into a huge pool, with a skylight above for illumination, roughly harvesting once a year, each yield more than what we could carry back and forth in ten trips. And my father would only make this long trade route once a year. As a result, the market saw an increase in the emerald corals, and he sold not only to the palace but also to those high nobles. If rarity determined the value, then the price of the emerald corals should have continually dropped."
"Yet, just after two years, the palace refused to accept those cheaper emerald corals, claiming they were counterfeits. The corals sold by my father not only did not drop in price, but they actually doubled. As for the noble who hid the witch, he was caught by the Church and burned at the stake alongside the witch for harboring a crime. But I know that the corals he cultivated were not counterfeit; they were no different from the emerald corals my father transported."
"The notion of rarity being valuable is not a wrong idea, but there are many reasons that determine the price of goods, and this is just the simplest example—because the Everwinter Royal Palace regarded the emerald corals as a symbol of luxury, they artificially determined its value. When more emerald corals appeared, it challenged the royal decree, and so on the day of the execution, the queen even celebrated grandly. Do you think, are these goods like us, the commoners?"
"Like... what?" Alesia hadn't come around yet.
"Like the people under royal authority, child," Mayra said slowly, "from the moment we are born, we are assigned a price, and this price is not a reflection of our true value. We are just like these emerald corals, seemingly alike, yet some are priced cheaply, while others are unattainably high."

"Unattainable... you mean the nobility."

"The nobility is the coral of the Eternal Winter Palace," the priest said with a smile. "They are born no different from us, with a pair of hands, a pair of feet, a pair of eyes, and a mouth. However, they are artificially designated with the highest value, and this inequality is not determined by their own abilities but by the dictates of royal power. That's why I joined the Church, at least in the New Holy City of Hermes, your birth does not limit your value. If we could turn the entire continent into the Church's ultimate sacred city, the so-called kingdom of the gods, it would be just like that."

"You speak so wonderfully!" Aletheia nodded repeatedly, her heart stirring with excitement. It would be such a beautiful scene if a kingdom of gods on earth could truly be established as Myra described, where people are born without regard to bloodline, and there are no serfs or slaves.

"A kingdom of gods? Hmph... How many more people do they want to turn into cold-blooded monsters?" The stern-faced captain of the Judgement Army shook his reins and stepped forward. "Priest, how much do you know about the God's Punishment Army?"

"Hey, you—" Aletheia was about to ask him to mind his manners when Myra stopped her.

"The God's Punishment Army consists of the Church's strongest warriors, transformed from the Judgement Army who are firm in their faith, willing to sacrifice, and courageous."

"The strongest, indeed, and the need for transformation from the Judgement Army is also true, but what they transform into are not warriors, but a bunch of emotionless monsters!" After dropping this cold remark, he spurred his horse to the front of the column.

"Such an impudent person!" Aletheia said resentfully. When she saw him in Hermes, she thought he was calm in the face of danger, possessing both the steadiness of a commander and the bravery of a warrior. How could he have become such a person now?

"It's alright, he's just troubled," Myra shook her head. "In order to build a kingdom of gods on earth, setbacks and sacrifices are inevitable... but at least we are willing."

The group arrived at the next town by nightfall, and the priest led the envoy to the church to rest. After dinner, everyone returned to their rooms to sleep, but Aletheia followed the commander of the Judgement Army in the corridor and stopped him.
"What do you mean by that, Lord Mayne is our leader. Have you forgotten all the rules and regulations of the church?"
"Your name is Aletheia, right?" He broke the silence.
"Yes, and now I am like you, a commander of the Judgement Army. I asked for your name back during the Evil Months, but you said nothing. Can you tell me your name now?"
"Abrams," he said expressionlessly, "As for why I did that... Do you have any brothers or sisters?"
"No." Aletheia suddenly remembered that he had once said his older brother was a member of the God's Punishment Army.
"I do. He and I grew up together in the church, and we knew each other as if we were one person. Later, he took the initiative to undergo the transformation into the God's Punishment Army, and I never saw him again—The Chief Inquisitor told me that his transformation was very successful, and that he was now out carrying out special missions for the church, and I genuinely felt happy for him." He paused, "Until one day, I saw him again in the great cathedral. I called out his name and went forward to embrace him, and guess what I saw?" A pained expression crossed Abrams's face, "A stranger. It was as if he didn't see me at all, he just walked past me, his eyes devoid of any sparkle, staring straight ahead, his movements nothing like those of a human being."
"..." A chill rose up Aletheia's back. She wanted to scream that the other party was lying, but she couldn't utter a word when she opened her mouth.
"The God's Punishment Army has been stripped of human emotions; they are nothing more than a moving heap of dead matter." He pushed past the stunned Aletheia and walked towards his room without looking back.
