## Establish the Ministry of Agriculture.
With the woodland on the southern bank of the Redwater River gradually being cleared, the day for plowing the fields was drawing nearer.



To facilitate the movement of people across the Redwater River, Roland ordered the construction of a pontoon bridge spanning nearly a hundred meters across the river. The lower part was made up of dozens of wooden rafts crafted by carpenters, connected with thick hemp ropes. He also specifically instructed the carpenters to shape the ends of the rafts into pointed tips so that they would face less resistance from the water's impact. The ends of the hemp ropes were wrapped around four round wooden stakes driven into the banks, securing the position of the rafts as much as possible. Each raft was laid with four long planks in the middle to serve as the bridge deck, allowing for four people to walk side by side with about two meters of space between them.



The raft bridge was simple to construct and had a long lifespan. As long as the river did not experience any sudden surges or drops that could break the hemp ropes, it could last for two to three years—the quality of the trees in the Misty Forest was excellent. For instance, the dock pillars and planking at the town's wharf were made from the forest's giant trees and had a lifespan almost as long as the town itself. Despite the creaking sounds when walking on them, there were no signs of collapse.



Crossing the pontoon bridge to the west, the first piece of land to be cultivated was Leaf's experimental field. Now it was tightly enclosed with wooden boards, with soldiers from the First Army standing guard at the entrance. These days, aside from eating, attending classes, and sleeping, Leaf spent all her time in the experimental field. From the window of his third-floor office, Roland could vaguely glimpse the scene within the wooden enclosure—the wheat was growing wildly, with the green spikes seen in the morning turning into a golden sea by the afternoon.



Relying on magical power, the "Golden No. 1" was accumulating seeds almost at the rate of one harvest per day. If outsiders were to see it, they might just kneel down and exclaim it to be a miracle.



Seeing that the land, population, and seeds were all ready, Roland decided to add the final element: a supervisor.



He summoned Barov, the Minister Assistant, who had been extremely busy lately.



"Your apprentices should be able to handle things on their own by now, right?" Roland asked. "I need to establish two new departments within the City Hall."



"Your Highness, this... we are short of hands," Barov replied with difficulty.



"You always used to agree immediately before slowly discussing the details, but now you've learned to complain first," Roland thought with a silent rebuke, but his face remained impassive. "How could there possibly not be enough? Didn't I just assign you a group of knights?"



Roland had initially screened out over fifty knights who met the requirements and could read and write. There weren't that many needed for teaching, so after selecting the best, nine knights were chosen to be junior teachers, and the rest were assigned to the City Hall to start as apprentices.



"Your Highness, those people are both dragging their feet and lazy, with slow reactions. They make several mistakes even when just copying documents. They are simply not fit to be apprentices."



"How to discipline them is your concern," Roland tapped the table, "Those who do not follow the arrangements can be sent directly to the North Slope Mine. But I am determined to establish these two departments."



"Alright, Your Highness, you have the final say," Barov said helplessly.



Roland continued, "The first one is the Department of Agriculture, responsible for supervising the planting and production of crops within the territory."



Barov was stunned, clearly hearing for the first time that the City Hall would even manage farming, "Your Highness, aren't such matters left to the serfs to deal with themselves? How they plant and harvest doesn't concern us, we just need to collect the full amount of taxes."



"That's why you... no, I mean the previous harvests have been so low," Roland picked up his cup and took a sip of water to cover his slip of the tongue, "A responsible City Hall should manage everything about the people's lives, even their food and waste."



"Food and waste... You're not joking, are you?"



"Of course not. The importance of food and drink goes without saying. It would be a dereliction of duty for the City Hall if we can't even ensure that our citizens are well-fed, and it would be my failure as well. As for the latter part, isn't the public toilet project built for that very purpose?" He dropped his casual tone and said seriously to Barov, "I don't know how the City Hall in King's City operates, perhaps the lives of the commoners mean nothing to them, but in Border Town, I intend to establish a versatile political institution that must be fully informed about every aspect of the territory and its people. Only then can we gain the wholehearted support of our citizens, and have our decrees executed efficiently. I will now explain the composition of this department and the tasks it needs to undertake. Make sure you take note."



"Yes, Your Highness," Barov wiped the sweat from his forehead.



"Go to the archives and find three or four people who have experience in farming to join the Agricultural Department. Also, assign two apprentices responsible for record-keeping and statistics. Six people should be enough."



"Wait... You want commoners to serve as officials in the City Hall?" Barov was shocked.



"Not only are they obedient, but they also have high enthusiasm for their work. Why can't they serve as officials? Officials are not synonymous with nobility, and the Agricultural Department needs professionals to guide future farming practices."



"But most of them can't even read..."



"That's why I need you to assign two apprentices to assist with the paperwork at first," Roland interrupted, "and this situation won't last long. I will soon implement a universal education plan in the territory, aimed at enabling everyone to read and write. After that, you won't have to worry about being short-staffed ever again."



This news seemed to shock Barov even more than the idea of commoners entering the City Hall. His mouth hung open, and he couldn't utter a word for a long time.



Roland didn't care whether he could accept it or not and continued, "Back to the matter of the Agricultural Department, serfs working their own land will inevitably produce varying levels of quality, such as some plowing deeper and others sowing more densely. This presents an excellent opportunity for observation. These six people in the Agricultural Department will need to assign numbers to the divided plots of land and record every step of the serfs' farming process, with detailed data on how deep they plow and the intervals at which they sow seeds. I will provide them with measuring tools and teach them how to use them."



"Are you saying... a comparison?" Barov may be somewhat old-fashioned in certain aspects, but his mind was quick to understand.



"Exactly, there is no need to worry too much about the yield for the first cultivation. Continuing to maintain food imports and... using some new varieties of wheat seeds will ensure that everyone has enough to eat. I need to find the most suitable method among these, compile it into a manual for record. In the future, wheat cultivation will follow this method, and the Ministry of Agriculture will be responsible for promotion, guidance, and supervision."



Roland did not know much about agriculture, but this did not prevent him from using scientific methods to summarize an optimal plan. With this plan, whether it is to expand the cultivated area or to add new farming populations, the average output of the land can be maintained at a higher level.



Barov nodded, then hesitated before saying, "Your Highness, there's something I don't understand. After the serfs are promoted to free citizens, why do you only collect twenty percent of the crops as land tax? Even if you asked for fifty percent, leaving fifty percent for them would still show your great generosity."



"Because money piled in the basement is meaningless," Roland explained, "After the twenty percent tax, I will buy the remaining food from them at a fixed price—here in Border Town, the grain trade is a monopoly of the lord. In this way, the castle gets the food, and they get paid. Once they have some savings, they will want to buy some things... such as oxen, iron farming tools, beef, cotton clothes, and good brick houses, all of which only I can provide. Residents in town who want to buy grain can only buy it from the castle as well. So, in the end, the money will still flow back into my pocket, but in the cycle, it can continuously improve everyone's standard of living. Do you understand now?"



Barov frowned and did not answer, obviously stuck in a state of confusion.



Roland smiled and shook his head, "If you don't understand, you can think about it slowly when you go back. Just do as I said for now."



The assistant minister stood up in a daze, and as he walked to the door, he suddenly turned back, "By the way, Your Highness, you just mentioned establishing two departments, what is the other one?"



"The Ministry of Education," Roland replied, "I will take charge of this one personally."
