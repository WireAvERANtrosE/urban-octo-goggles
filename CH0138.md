## Establish the Ministry of Agriculture
As the woodland along the southern bank of the Redwater River was gradually cleared, the day for plowing the fields drew ever closer.



To facilitate the movement of people between the two banks of the Redwater River, Roland ordered the construction of a floating bridge over the nearly hundred-meter-wide river. The lower part was made up of dozens of wooden rafts crafted by carpenters, connected with thick hemp ropes. He also specifically instructed the carpenters to shape the ends of the rafts into pointed angles so that they would offer less resistance to the impact of water. The ends of the hemp ropes were wrapped around four round wooden stakes driven into the banks, keeping the rafts as stationary as possible. Each raft had four long planks laid across the middle to serve as the bridge deck, and after gathering, it allowed four people to walk abreast.



The raft bridge was simple to construct and had a not insignificant lifespan. As long as the river didn't experience a sudden rise or fall that could break the hemp ropes, it could last two to three years—The trees of the Misty Forest were of excellent quality. For example, the dock pilings and planks of the town pier were made from the forest's large trees, and their lifespan was almost as long as the town itself. Despite the creaking noises when walking on them, there were no signs of collapse.



Crossing the floating bridge to the west, the first plot of cleared land was Leaf's experimental field. Now it was tightly surrounded by wooden planks, with soldiers from the First Army guarding the entrance. Aside from eating, attending classes, and sleeping, Leaf spent all her time in the experimental field these days. From the window of his third-floor office, Roland could vaguely see the scene within the wooden enclosures—the wheat there was growing wildly; the green wheat ears seen in the morning turned into a golden sea by the afternoon.



The Golden One, grown by magic, was accumulating seeds at an almost one-ripening-per-day pace. If outsiders saw this, they might kneel down and cry out a miracle.



Seeing that the land, population, and seeds were all ready, Roland decided to add the last piece to the puzzle: a supervisor.



He summoned Barov, the minister assistant who had been extremely busy lately.



"Your apprentices should be able to stand on their own by now," Roland asked, "I need to establish two new departments in the City Hall."



"Your Highness, this... We are short on manpower," Barov said with difficulty.



Before, you used to agree right away and then slowly discuss the details, now it seems you've learned to complain first. Roland thought to himself with a sneer, but his face remained impassive. "How could it not be enough? Didn't I just assign you a batch of knights?"



Roland had initially screened out over fifty knights who met the requirements and could read and write. There were too many for the teaching positions, so they picked the best of the best, and finally, nine knights were selected to serve as junior teachers, with the rest allocated to the City Hall to start as apprentices.



"Your Highness, those people are both sluggish and lazy, with slow reactions; they even make several mistakes when copying documents. They're simply not qualified to be apprentices."



"How to manage them is your responsibility," Roland tapped the table, "those who do not comply with the arrangements can be sent to the Northern Slope Mine. But I am determined to establish these two departments."



"Alright, Your Highness, you have the final say," Barov said helplessly.



Roland continued, "The first one is the Department of Agriculture, responsible for overseeing the planting and production of crops within the territory."



Barov was stunned, obviously hearing for the first time that the City Hall would even manage farming, "Your Highness, isn't that something the serfs should be struggling with on their own? How they plant and harvest is none of our concern; we just need to receive the full amount of taxes."



"That's why your... no, I mean the past crop yields were so low." Roland picked up his cup and took a sip of water, to cover up his slip of the tongue, "A responsible City Hall should manage everything, even the people's basic living needs."



"Basic living needs... You're not joking, are you?"



"Of course not, the importance of food and drink goes without saying. If the people can't even get enough to eat, it's a dereliction of duty on the part of the City Hall, and it's my failure as well. As for the latter part, isn't the public restroom project built for that very purpose?" He put away his casual tone and seriously said to Barov, "I don't know how the City Hall in King's City operates, or perhaps the life and death of commoners are of no concern to them, but in Border Town, what I want to establish is an all-encompassing political institution. It must be fully aware of all aspects concerning the territory and its people, so as to gain the wholehearted support of the populace. This ensures that the decrees issued are executed efficiently. I'll now explain the composition of this department and the tasks it needs to undertake. Make sure you remember them."



"Yes, Your Highness." Barov wiped the sweat from his forehead.



"Go to the archives and find three or four people who have done farm work before, and include them in the Agricultural Department. Then assign two apprentices responsible for recording and statistics. Six people should be about enough."



"Wait... You want commoners to become officials in the City Hall?" Barov was shocked.



"Not only are they obedient, but they are also enthusiastic about their work. Why can't they be officials? Officials are not synonymous with nobility, and besides, the Agricultural Department also needs some professionals to guide future farming."



"But most of them can't even read..."



"That's why you need to first assign two apprentices to help with clerical work," Roland interrupted, "and this situation won't last too long. I will soon implement an education universalization plan in the territory, with the goal of enabling everyone to read and write. Then you won't have to worry about being short-handed anymore."



Clearly, this news was even more shocking to Barov than the idea of commoners entering the City Hall. His mouth was slightly agape, and he was unable to utter a word for a long while.



Roland didn't care whether he could accept it or not and continued, "Back to the matter of the Agricultural Department. When serfs are cultivating their own land, there will inevitably be a disparity in proficiency. For example, some people may plow deeper, others may sow more densely. This is an excellent opportunity for observation. The six people in the Agricultural Department need to number the divided plots of land and record every step of the serfs' cultivation process in detail—how deep they plow, the intervals between sowing. I will provide them with measuring tools and teach them how to use them."



"You mean... comparison?" Barov might be somewhat old-fashioned in certain aspects, but his mind was quite quick.



"Exactly. For the initial cultivation, we don't need to worry too much about the yield. Continuing to maintain grain imports and... using some new varieties of wheat seeds will be enough to ensure that no one goes hungry. I need to find the most suitable method among these, compile it into a manual, and record it. In the future, all wheat cultivation will be carried out according to this method. The Ministry of Agriculture will be responsible for promoting, instructing, and supervising."



Roland wasn't very knowledgeable about farming, but that didn't prevent him from using scientific thinking to summarize the best solution. With this solution, whether it was expanding the cultivation area or adding new farming population in the future, it would be possible to maintain a higher average yield of the land.



Barov nodded, then hesitated before speaking, "Your Highness, there's something I don't understand. After serfs are promoted to freemen, why do you only take twenty percent of the crops as a land tax? Even if you demanded fifty percent, leaving fifty percent for them would still seem very generous on your part."



"Because money has no meaning when it's piled up in a basement," Roland explained, "After they give up twenty percent, I will purchase the remaining food from them at a fixed price— in Border Town, grain trade is an exclusive right of the lord. In this way, the castle gets food, and they get compensation. Once they have some savings, they will want to buy some things... like oxen, iron farming tools, beef, cotton clothes, and good-quality brick houses, all of which only I can provide. The residents of the town who want to buy grain will also have to purchase it from the castle. Thus, in the end, the money will still flow back into my pocket, but in the cycle, it can continuously improve everyone's standard of living. Do you understand now?"



Barov furrowed his brows and did not reply for a while, clearly puzzled and unable to figure it out.



Roland shook his head with a smile, "If you don't understand, you can think about it slowly when you go back. For now, just do as I say."



The assistant minister stood up in a daze, and when he reached the door, he suddenly turned back, "By the way, Your Highness, you just mentioned establishing two departments; what's the other one?"



"The Ministry of Education," Roland replied, "I will take charge of that myself."
