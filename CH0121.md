## Plunder
...

After all five families had asked their questions, Roland let out a sigh of relief.

He leaned back in his chair while Nightingale voluntarily came behind him and stretched out her hands to knead his shoulders.

It had only taken one day to defeat the Duke and occupy the lord's castle in the city.

Things had gone smoother than he had anticipated. After the Duke fell in battle, the majority chose to surrender. The mercenaries even switched sides, kneeling on the ground, expressing their willingness to serve the prince.

Thus, the mercenaries guarded the surrendered knights and nobles, while the First Army watched over the mercenaries. A large group marched eastward and arrived at Longsong Stronghold by three in the afternoon. The guards at the city gates, upon seeing the head of the Duke of Lion and the many captured nobles, immediately opened the gates to welcome the fourth prince into the city.

Roland did not make a big show of gathering all the nobles in the city to announce its new ownership, but went straight to the lord's castle.

The castle, situated at the highest point in the stronghold, was like a city within a city. A small-scale battle broke out when entering the castle district; Nightingale blew open the garden gate with explosive packs, and the twenty-plus guards who had not followed the Duke into battle tried to stop Roland from entering. They were killed by the First Army. The guards had used hand crossbows, causing injuries to five members of the army, with two of them seriously wounded. Fortunately, Nana, who accompanied the army, immediately healed them.

Another ten personal guards attempted to secretly take the Duke's family and flee from the back door of the castle but were spotted by Lightning, who was surveilling from the air, and they were quickly surrounded and captured. The Duke's wife and two sons surrendered without a fight—they were still in the dark about the news of the Duke's defeat until that moment.



After taking control of the lord's castle, the First Army of Border Town immediately took over the defense of the castle district. It has to be said that the Duke of Lion’s castle was three to four times larger than that of Border Town, and much more majestic in appearance. The six watchtowers formed the hexagonal outline of the castle, and the central tower was nearly five stories high— a rare high-rise building of the era. The garden contained residences, warehouses, stables, and everything else one could need, and the castle even had private dungeons underground.



Roland crammed the valuable captives and the duke's family into the cells, dismissed all the civilians, confiscated the mercenaries' weapons, and placed them in the vacant rooms of the garden in batches. At the same time, he picked out a few leaders to watch over their own, offering them high salaries— in Roland's eyes, the Northern Slope Mine was the best destination for these opportunists, but he had more important matters to attend to at the moment.



That was the most crucial Loot phase after a battle—commonly known as searching the bodies.



Roland, with a group of witches, turned the castle inside out, not even sparing the God's Punishment Stones placed in the vault and secret chambers. After a thorough search, the results were deeply moving. Just in the basement warehouse, two large chests of Gold royals were found, conservatively estimated to be more than ten thousand in number. Nightingale discovered dozens of gems the size of eyeballs in a secret compartment in the bedroom, while Echo found a secret room behind the fireplace. Inside the chamber, not only were there all sorts of gold artifacts such as scepters and crowns, but also many dazzling pieces of jewelry neatly hung on wooden racks on the wall.



This was the wealth of a duke!



Looking at this huge fortune and thinking back to Border Town's total mineral revenue of less than five hundred Gold royals for the autumn and winter seasons, Roland was filled with emotion. The allure of plundering was precisely this; if he didn't come from a highly developed industrial society, he might have been lost in it too.



However, emotions aside, these things still needed to be taken. In the foreseeable future, the labor population of Border Town would increase significantly, and before the local agriculture developed, he needed a large sum of money to import food from other places.



So, Hummingbird dematerialized the chests of treasures one by one, and Iron Axe and the prince's personal guards were responsible for escorting them back to their own castle via the "Littletown." Considering the time spent enchanting large items, the entire transportation would take about three days.



This was also why Roland decided not to demand Gold royals for ransom the next day. Having devoured a duke, he had already made a substantial profit, and now he needed living people and livestock even more.



"Your Highness, are you really staying here for only one week?" Nightingale asked.

"What's the matter?" Roland closed his eyes, enjoying the tingling sensation on his shoulders.

"Isn't this the largest city in the Western Region?" she whispered. "Don't you want to stay in this more prosperous place compared to Border Town?"

"The power structure in Longsong Stronghold is complicated and not suitable for what I want to do. Everything is fine if it stays as it is, but if I want to make changes, the resistance I will encounter will only grow. And right now, I cannot simply eliminate them all by force." Roland smiled. "Of course, the most important reason is that the people here are deeply influenced by the Church, and it would be difficult for them to accept you in a short period. I've said before that I hope witches can walk freely on the streets. Border Town has already achieved this."

"Mhm," Nightingale said softly, "You've kept your promise."

...

On the third day, Peter hurried over with his list, and as usual, Roland received him in the hall.

"Your Highness, I have made my choices."

"Let me see." Roland took the list. As he had expected, the list was mostly comprised of serfs worth 2 points—about eight hundred people, one hundred cattle, and three hundred sheep, which took up 900 points in total. The rest were various craftsmen.



"Your Highness, is this acceptable?"

"Of course, as long as you gather a total of three thousand points," Roland handed the list back to Peter, "When can you assemble these people and supplies?"

"I can do it today, I've made arrangements based on the assets and serfs of the Honeysuckle domain. However, Your Highness, if you wish to bring them back to Border Town, it might take about half a month."

"That will be for you to complete," Roland tapped on the tabletop, "You should have experience organizing caravans for transportation, right?"

"Yes, Your Highness," Peter hesitated, "Then my father..."

"You can take him back today," the prince said with a smile, as he handed him a scroll of parchment, "If you find no issues, sign and press your seal here."

"Is this... a proxy contract?" Peter glanced at the beginning and his voice became excited, "You've agreed to grant the proxy rights to the Honeysuckle family? Please wait a moment." He spread out the scroll and began to read the contract carefully.

Roland nodded in satisfaction at the other party's caution—as a collaborator, valuing the contract is the most basic requirement.

After a while, Peter looked up, "The content here is basically consistent with what you told me yesterday, there is just one thing..." he pointed to the end of the contract, "Your Highness, shouldn't my father's name be written here? He is the Earl of Honeysuckle and the representative of our family."



Roland laughed, "Of course not, it is you who discussed the matter of the agent with me, not your father. Therefore, the name at the end of this contract will naturally be yours."



Peter was stunned for a moment, somewhat in disbelief he asked, "Your Highness, do you mean to let me—"



"That's right, you will take the place of the Duke, and manage the Longsong Stronghold for me," Roland nodded, "If the contract is carried out smoothly, after I become king, you can also continue to own this city." He paused, his smile fading, "However, if you violate the contract, your fate will be the same as the Duke's—I was able to take Longsong Stronghold once, and I can do it a second time. Work hard, Mr. Ambassador."
