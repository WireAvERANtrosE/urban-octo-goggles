## Plunder
After all five families had made their inquiries, Roland let out a sigh of relief. 
He leaned back in his chair, and Nightingale took the initiative to walk behind him and began to massage his shoulders.
It only took one day from defeating the duke to entering and occupying the lord's castle.
Things went smoother than he had imagined. After the duke died in battle, the majority chose to surrender. The mercenaries even switched sides, kneeling on the ground one after another, expressing their willingness to serve the prince.
Thus, the mercenaries guarded the surrendered knights and nobles, while the First Army oversaw the mercenaries. A large group proceeded eastward in high spirits and arrived at Longsong Stronghold at three in the afternoon. Upon seeing Duke Ryan's head and a large number of captured nobles, the guards at the city gate immediately opened the gates wide to welcome the Fourth Prince into the city.
Roland did not make a grand announcement to all the nobles in the city regarding the ownership of the city. Instead, he headed straight for the lord's castle.
The castle was situated in the highest terrain at the center of the stronghold, resembling a city within a city. A small-scale battle erupted when they entered the castle area. Nightingale blew open the garden gate with a blasting pack, and over twenty guards who had not followed the duke into battle tried to stop Roland from entering. They were killed by the First Army. The opposition used hand crossbows during their stubborn resistance, causing injuries to five members of the team, two of them seriously. Fortunately, Nana, who accompanied the army, healed them immediately.
Another ten personal guards tried to secretly take the duke's family and flee from the back door of the castle. They were spotted by Lightning, who was monitoring from the air, and were promptly rounded up. The duke's wife and two sons were captured without resistance—they were still in the dark about the duke's defeat until that moment.

After taking control of the lord's castle, the First Army of Border Town immediately took over the defense of the castle district. It must be said that Duke Ryan's castle was three to four times larger than that of Border Town's and much more magnificent in design. Six watchtowers formed its hexagonal outline, with the central main tower nearly five stories high—a rare high-rise building of the era. Inside the courtyard were residences, warehouses, stables, and everything one could need, and the castle even had private dungeons underground.

He crammed the valuable prisoners and the duke's family into the cells, disbanded the commoners, confiscated the mercenaries' weapons, and settled them in batches into the vacant houses in the garden. At the same time, he picked out several leaders to supervise their own men, offering them high salaries—for Roland, the mines were the best destination for these opportunistic fellows, but he had more important things to do at the moment.

That is the most critical part after a battle—the so-called looting of the riches.

Roland, accompanied by a group of witches, turned the castle upside down, not even sparing the Divine Stone of Judgment placed in the treasury and secret rooms. After a thorough search, the results were truly touching. Just from the two large chests of Gold royals found in the basement warehouse, there were conservatively estimated to be more than ten thousand coins. Nightingale found dozens of gems the size of eyeballs in a hidden compartment in the bedroom, while Echo discovered a secret chamber behind the fireplace. Inside this secret room, not only were there various gold artifacts such as scepters and crowns, but also many dazzling pieces of jewelry neatly hung on wooden racks on the wall.

This was the wealth of a duke!

Roland looked at this immense fortune, and then thought about the total income of less than five hundred Gold royals from the ore of Border Town during the autumn and winter seasons, his heart filled with emotions. The alluring aspect of plundering was precisely this; if he hadn't come from a highly developed industrial society, he might have become obsessed with it too.

However, despite these reflections, these treasures still had to be taken. In the foreseeable future, the labor population of Border Town would increase significantly, and before the local agriculture could be developed, he needed a large amount of money to import food from other areas.

Thus, Hummingbird turned the chests of treasures into a light weight, with Iron Axe and the prince's personal guards responsible for escorting them back to their own castle for storage via the First Army's transport ship, the Seagull. Considering the time spent enchanting large items, it would take about three days to complete all the transportation.

This was also the reason why Roland decided not to demand Gold royals for ransom the next day. Having fully consumed a duke's wealth, he had already benefited immensely; now what he needed more were living people and livestock.

"Your Highness, are you really only staying here for one week?" Nightingale asked.
"What's the matter?" Roland closed his eyes, enjoying the tingling massage on his shoulders.
"This is the largest city in the Western Territory, isn't it?" she said softly, "Don't you want to stay in this more prosperous place than Border Town?"
"The Longsong Stronghold is a complex web of power and not suitable for what I want to do. Everything is fine as long as it remains the same, but if I want to make changes, the resistance I encounter will only get bigger. And right now, I can't just ruthlessly eliminate all of them," Roland said with a smile. "Of course, the most important thing is that the people here are deeply influenced by the Church, and it would be difficult for them to accept you all in a short period. I once said that I hope witches could walk freely on the streets, and Border Town has now achieved this."
"Mm," Nightingale said softly, "You have kept your promise."
...
On the third day, Petro rushed over with his list, and Roland, as usual, received him in the hall.
"Your Highness, I have made my choice."
"Let me see," Roland took the list. As he had expected, the majority of the list was filled with serfs worth 2 points, about eight hundred people, one hundred cattle, and three hundred sheep, which together accounted for 900 points, with the rest being various craftsmen.

"Your Highness, is this acceptable?"
"Of course, as long as you gather three thousand points worth," Roland returned the list to Petro, "When can you assemble these people and resources?"
"I can do it today. This plan is based on the assets and subjects in the Honeysuckle fief. However, Your Highness, if you wish to bring them back to Border Town, it might take about half a month."
"That will be for you to accomplish," Roland tapped on the desk, "You should have experience in organizing merchant caravans, right?"
"Yes, Your Highness," Petro hesitated, "Then my father..."
"You can take him back today," the prince said with a smile while handing him a scroll of parchment, "If you find everything in order, sign your name and press your seal here."
"Is this... a proxy contract?" Petro scanned the beginning and became excited, "You've agreed to grant the proxy rights to the Honeysuckle family? Please wait a moment." He spread out the scroll and began to read the contract carefully.
Roland nodded in satisfaction at the other party's caution—as a collaborator, valuing the contract was a basic requirement.
After a while, Petro lifted his head, "The content here is basically consistent with what you told me yesterday, only there is one point..." he pointed to the end of the contract, "Your Highness, shouldn't this be my father's name written here? He is the Earl of Honeysuckle and the representative of our family."

Roland smiled, "Of course not, it was you who discussed the matter of the agent with me, not your father. Therefore, at the end of this contract, it is naturally your name that will be written."

Petro froze for a moment, somewhat in disbelief, he asked, "Your Highness, do you mean to let me—"

"That's right, you will take the Duke's place and manage the Longsong Stronghold for me," Roland nodded. "If the contract is carried out smoothly, after I become king, you can continue to own this city." He paused and his smile faded, "However, if you breach the contract, your end will be the same as the Duke's—I was able to take Longsong Stronghold once, and I can do it a second time. Do well, Mr. Ambassador."
