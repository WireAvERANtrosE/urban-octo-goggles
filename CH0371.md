## Forest Heart
Roland walked to the center of the garden, and couldn't help but be stunned.

At the end of the path, a quaint room made of plants appeared before him. Tree trunks and modified crops formed the walls, while intertwining vines hung overhead, as if they had been carefully woven together. Clusters of crystal-clear grapes dangled among the green leaves. In the middle of the room, a bonfire was burning, surrounded by verdant furniture—which upon closer inspection, were all made from peculiar plants growing from the ground. For a moment, he thought he had entered a world from a fairy tale. Had it not been for the presence of several familiar figures standing by the fire, he might have doubted if this was all just a dream.

"What's going on here?"

Tilly turned her head, showing an expression of wonder. "Leaf's abilities have evolved; she has become this garden."

"Where is she?" Roland asked in surprise.

"She has merged with the plants," Tilly looked around. "Everything you see here is a part of Leaf."

So the previous feeling that he was walking within a gigantic living organism was not an illusion, only now the "gigantic organism" had become Leaf. Roland felt a sudden tightness in his heart, "She won't be unable to return to normal, will she?"

"As long as I release my ability, I can return to my normal state," Leaf's voice suddenly sounded.

However, upon closer listening, it wasn't her speaking directly, but rather a combination of the rustling of leaves and the rubbing of branches that formed her speech.



The response from the other party allowed Roland to relax a bit, "Can you hear us talking?"

"Not only can I hear, but I can also see, smell, touch," Leaf appeared very pleased, "I can sense every little change in the garden, including the birds building their nests on the branches and the insects crawling on the tree trunks... It's hard to describe this feeling in words, Lady Tilly was right, I am now the garden itself. From the moment you stepped in here, I noticed you."

As she spoke, a giant curled-up leaf descended from the ceiling to Roland's hand and slowly unfolded to reveal a cup holding a purplish-red liquid inside. The cup was made of four overlapping olive leaves, with the petioles forming the handle, looking exquisitely dainty. Roland picked up the cup and took a sip, finding to his surprise that it was newly brewed grape wine, tart with a refreshing sweetness. It seemed that both the drink and the container were products of this garden.

Roland drank the "toast" from the other party, walked over to the campfire, and sat down with interest on a plant bench—its supports were made of rough tree branches and both the seat and back were covered with a thick layer of wheat leaves, sitting on it felt like sinking into a sofa. By the fire stood a grill, with Andrea roasting apples and corn for everyone. Undoubtedly, these too were sourced directly from the garden.

"How do you manage all this?" the prince asked, looking up.

"I'm not very clear on the process," the voice responded promptly, "I was just taking care of the newly planted crops and your flying messengers as usual, while also practicing my abilities—then they responded to my call. This might be the path of fusion I've been looking for, turning the jungle and the life it nurtures into a true whole."

"What if you use your powers in the Misty Forest? Could you make it a part of you too?"

"I think... no," she hesitated for a moment, "Even if possible, it would take a very long time. Maintaining this state doesn't require much magical power, in fact, the forest even replenishes it for me, but with every expansion of my control range, I feel my thoughts slowing down."

"Thoughts slowing down?" Roland was taken aback.



"I don't know how to describe this feeling," Leaf said, "If I slowly expand my control, in a few years, I should be able to merge with the Misty Forest. But if I merge with it instantly, I'm afraid I'll lose my consciousness—it felt like my brain wasn't enough when I first merged with the garden, as if my mind suddenly became incredibly spacious. It took me a while to adapt and return to normal." She paused, then added, "However, once I've controlled a plant, re-entering it doesn't bring that unfamiliarity anymore. I can do it as soon as the thought arises."



It was indeed incredible, Roland thought to himself, comparing Anna and Lily's evolution towards the microscopic, Leaf's new ability was clearly a breakthrough on a macroscopic level. If one day she could control the entire Misty Forest, no enemy's movement would escape her notice.



"Congratulations," Wendy said with a smile, "Now the Witches' Union has gained another evolved witch. According to Agatha's words, this is already equivalent to half the scale of the Union."



"If she were here, she would definitely have a lot to exclaim about," Roland laughed, then looked towards the little girl who was curiously peeking at him, "What about Paper?"



"Regarding her ability... it probably requires further testing," Wendy replied, "But I've noticed a strange phenomenon."



After she finished speaking, she snapped her fingers, and two bundles of packed snow quickly fell from the roof.



Wendy spread them out, one beside the campfire and the other in a corner of the room. Then she asked Paper to use her ability on them, "I'm guiding her on how to use her magic power evenly to achieve a stable effect—just like how you first taught me. Although she can't control it precisely yet, the results are not too far off."



Roland noticed that the snow near the campfire quickly melted into a puddle of ice water, while the one farther away had only melted halfway.



Wendy picked up the melted water, walked to the wall, and knocked on it. The tightly wrapped vines contracted to both sides, revealing a fist-sized hole, and the cold outdoor wind immediately poured in.



"Come on, try using your ability on this," she said to the white paper.

The little girl nodded, stretched out her hands, and Roland was surprised to find that the snow water blooming in the leaves had once again formed a thin layer of ice crystals.

"Is this... accelerating time, making the result appear prematurely?" He voiced his guess but immediately refuted it. That's not right, time is merely a concept created by humans for convenience, it doesn't actually exist. How can you affect something that doesn't exist?

"I thought so too at first, but Lady Tilly said that's not the case," Wendy said, suspending a piece of rock with a vine and swinging it in front of the white paper. The latter used her ability again, but the pendulum's speed did not change; it continued to swing at the same amplitude until it eventually stopped, "If it were accelerating time, it should swing faster, right?"

Indeed, Roland quickly realized the nature of her ability—she was not affecting time, but the motion of particles. Magic changed the particle's energy level, causing it to decrease or increase, which manifested macroscopically as freezing or melting. Of course, the white paper might not understand this at all; she simply released her ability based on her own sensations, which is why she concluded that it had little effect on other objects: Oxidation is a relatively lengthy process, requiring more time to observe the outcome.

If his guess was correct, then her ability was essentially a natural catalyst.
