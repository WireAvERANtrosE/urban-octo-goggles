## Preparation Against the Enemy
Roland learned of the large group approaching on the morning of the second day, as Lightning discovered this slowly advancing party during her routine patrol.



"What, more than a thousand people?" He was stunned for a moment. Wasn't it agreed to be a delegation of fifty?



"Mhm, Grr," Maggie added, "But there aren't many on horseback, only six!"



"And the foot soldiers... what about their clothing and weapons?"



"Pretty ordinary, most of them don't have armor, just normal linen clothes," Lightning said, "The weapons are also a mixed bag, but a few hundred people are carrying short spears on their backs."



Such poor equipment standards, could they all be conscripted civilians or serfs? Roland wondered. In this era, there was fundamentally no specialized training for militia; plainly speaking, they were logistics teams responsible for transporting food and baggage for the knight troops and sometimes could be used as cannon fodder to consume the enemy's arrows.



If Timothy wanted to resolve matters with force, it was impossible not to learn about the battle that erupted between Longsong Stronghold and Border Town. Not even the more than two hundred knights of Duke Lion's allied forces had been able to get close to the town, let alone this group of militia running on their legs. Knowing the process and outcome of the battle yet still advancing on the town could only mean they were confident in breaking through the dense line of musketeers.



Roland couldn't help but think of the Church's pills.



He had previously speculated whether the Church, while supporting him and Garcia, was also supporting Timothy. If these people all had the pills, the situation would become entirely different.



It can make humans run at speeds close to that of a horse in a short period, while also being fearless of pain. That is to say, the musket line will face the charge of over a thousand "knights." Just one of them breaking through the ranks would bring casualties to the First Army.

Fortunately, the First Army is no longer the same as it was over two months ago.

Although only around a hundred revolving rifles have been equipped, the density of fire delivery has far surpassed that of the flintlock troops. Especially after snipers were paired with dedicated loaders, any enemy entering within three hundred meters would encounter relentless attacks. The artillery has also been expanded after the battle at the stronghold, from the original four units to the current twenty units, each equipped with a modified twelve-pound field cannon with an increased caliber, raising the effective range to over a kilometer.

However, Roland thought of another problem.

"Have you noticed if those on foot are wearing God's Punishment Stones?"

"I didn't dare get too close," Lightning pointed at Maggie, "this one sees much clearer than I do after transforming into an eagle."

The latter shook her head, "No, I didn't see any, perhaps they are hidden under their clothes, coo!"

"In that case..." Roland pondered, "take Nightingale on another flight. Carrying just one person, you can fly at an altitude of about ten meters, right? Fly along the Redwater River. Maggie will be responsible for scouting ahead. If you encounter any passing ships, Nightingale will enter her Mist state to advance." He looked towards Nightingale, "After approaching the enemy, observe from a distance whether a large number of the enemy troops are carrying God's Punishment Stones. Do not attack rashly."

"Yes," Nightingale and Lightning said in unison.



Just as the three of them were about to set off, Roland stopped them. "Remember, safety is the most important thing. Take good care of yourselves."

"No problem," Nightingale winked and smiled.



After the witches left, he felt a vague unease. Was that last sentence too much like tempting fate?



Moreover, he realized a significant oversight in his work—the control over intelligence regarding the Longsong Stronghold was too weak—if it weren't for Peter sending a messenger, he might have found himself facing enemies at his doorstep before he even knew it. Once caught in street fighting, the First Army, without its firepower advantage, would find it hard to turn the situation around.



"I'm still too young and too naive," Roland thought. This aspect must be improved after the war, and not just intelligence—the people around Peter should also include his own.



The prince sat at his desk, restless, with no appetite for lunch, until Lightning flew into the room with Nightingale on her back, as sprightly as a sprite, and he finally breathed a sigh of relief.



Maggie landed on Nightingale's shoulder, flapping her wings, and loudly said, "No cluck, no cluck!"



"No God's Punishment Stones?"



"Mostly none," Nightingale removed her hood, and her golden hair cascaded down. "I observed from the front to the end of the line, aside from the ten leading the team, there were only three or four black voids in the militia."



"Very good," Roland immediately formed a preliminary battle plan in his mind, "You must all be hungry, right? Head to the dining hall first, and tell the chef whatever you want to eat."

"Honey roast meat coo!" Maggie stretched her wings and declared proudly.

...

Outside the eastern end of the town.

Tanner glanced at the busy stonemasons and workers lining the road, "What on earth are they building?"

Hundreds of people first dug several large pits in the ground, then began to build brick walls around the edges of the pits. He originally thought that these walls would connect at both ends to block the road, but to his surprise, they were built around the pits.

"Who cares, I just know there are more enemies to beat up." Jop excitedly said while securing the cannon mount into place.

Indeed, Tanner thought. Ever since the last defeat of the Duke's Allied Forces, His Highness the Prince personally awarded each member of the artillery team a bronze medal... no, a badge. The front of the badge featured the high wall emblem of Longsong Stronghold, and the back was engraved with the year and battle achievements, exquisitely made, which made the members of the Gun Squad green with envy.

Moreover, in addition to this honor, everyone had been promoted. Tanner was now the captain of the artillery team, in charge of ten cannon groups. Rodney brothers, Moe, and Jop had been promoted to group leaders, with three of them being transferred to newly established groups, teaching the recruits how to operate the cannons.



The most exhilarating news was that His Highness the Prince had kept his promise. Tanner had been allocated a piece of land at the foot of the Impassable Mountain Range on the eastern side of the town. Although it was currently just a forest, a stone stele had been erected, symbolizing that the rights to use the land now belonged to him.

Therefore, when word got out that enemies intended to invade the town, the First Army immediately boiled with excitement. Everyone was eager and rubbing their hands together, hoping to distinguish themselves in the upcoming battle.

As dusk fell, having finished a day's drill, Tanner wiped the sweat from his forehead and rested, leaning against a cannon carriage. He had spent the entire afternoon moving between the artillery units, checking whether the new recruits followed the prescribed firing procedures, and his throat was almost smoking from all the shouting.

"Have some water," Jop offered him a waterskin.

"Thanks." Tanner unscrewed the cap and drained it in one gulp.

"I think I know what they're building," the former said with a smug smile.

"Really?" He handed the waterskin back. By this time, the brick wall had been built to half a person's height, roughly enclosing the pit into a hexagonal shape. However, each wall had a narrow horizontal slit at about thirty to forty centimeters from the ground, somewhat resembling a window, but it appeared to be a bit too narrow. "It can't be a house, can it?"

"It's not wrong to call it a house, I just went to ask a stonemason," Jop nodded, "He told me it's something the Prince came up with. As long as the gunners hide in this semi-underground house to shoot, they'll have nothing to worry about from behind. But it has a special name, His Highness calls it a 'bunker'."
