## Preparation to Meet the Enemy
Roland learned of the approaching large troop the next morning, when Lightning's routine patrol discovered this slowly advancing group.

"What, more than a thousand people?" he was stunned, wasn't it agreed to be a delegation of fifty?

"Mmm-hmm," Maggie added, "but not many are riding horses, only six!"

"What about the people on foot... their attire and weapons?"

"Pretty ordinary, most of them don't have armor, just plain hemp clothes," Lightning said, "and the weapons are all sorts, but a few hundred people carry short spears on their backs."

Such poor equipment, could they all be conscripted civilians or serfs? Roland wondered. In this era, there was no specialized training for militia, to put it plainly, they were just logistics teams responsible for transporting food and baggage for the knight troops, and sometimes they could also serve as cannon fodder, consuming the enemy's arrows.

If Timothy intended to solve the problem with force, it was impossible that he did not learn about the battle that erupted between Longsong Stronghold and Border Town. More than two hundred knights of the Duke Ryan coalition didn't even get close to the town, let alone this group of militia running on their feet. Knowing the process and outcome of the battle and still advancing on the town could only mean they were confident in breaking through the dense line of musketeers.

Roland couldn't help but think of the Church's pills.

He had previously speculated whether the Church, while supporting him and Grace, was also supporting Timothy. If these people all possessed the pills, the situation would become completely different.



It allows humans to run at speeds close to that of horses in a short time while not fearing pain, which means that the musket line will face the charge of over a thousand "knights." Just one person breaking through the ranks would cause casualties to the First Army.

Fortunately, the First Army is no longer the same as it was over two months ago.

Although only about a hundred revolving rifles have been equipped, their firepower density has far surpassed that of the flintlock troops. Especially after assigning dedicated loaders to the marksmen, any enemy entering within 300 meters will face relentless attacks. The artillery battalion has also been expanded after the fortress battle, growing from the original four groups to the current twenty, each equipped with a modified twelve-pound field gun. The caliber has been increased, bringing the effective range to over a kilometer.

However, Roland thought of another problem.

"Did you notice if those on foot were wearing the Divine Stone of Judgement?" he asked.

"I didn't dare get too close," Lightning pointed at Maggie, "this guy sees much clearer than I do after transforming into an eagle."

The latter shook her head, "I didn't see it, perhaps it's hidden under their clothes, coo!"

"In that case..." Roland pondered, "take Nightingale on another flight. With just one person on your back, you should be able to fly at a height of about ten meters, right? Fly along the Redwater River, with Maggie on lookout ahead, and if you encounter any passing ships, Nightingale can proceed in her mist form." He looked at Nightingale, "After getting close to the enemy, observe from a distance whether anyone in the large troop is carrying the Divine Stone of Judgement, and do not attack rashly."

"Yes," Nightingale and Lightning said in unison.



Just as the three were about to set off, Roland called out to them, "Remember, safety is the most important thing. Take care of yourselves."

"No problem," Nightingale winked and smiled.

After the witches left, he felt vaguely uneasy. Was that last sentence too much like tempting fate?

Moreover, he also realized a major oversight in his work, which was the weak control over intelligence on Longsong Stronghold—if it weren't for the messenger sent by Petrov, he might have found himself surprised by the enemy at his doorstep. Once caught in street fighting, the First Army would struggle to regain the situation without their firepower advantage.

"I'm still too young, too naive," thought Roland. This issue must be rectified after the war, and not just in intelligence. He should also place his own people around Petrov.

The prince sat restlessly at his desk, without the appetite for lunch, until Lightning, carrying Nightingale, flew into the room like a sprite, and he finally breathed a sigh of relief.

Maggie landed on Nightingale's shoulder, flapping her wings and loudly declared, "No caw, no caw!"

"No Divine Stone of Judgement?"

"Mostly not," Nightingale took off her hood, her blond hair cascading down, "I observed from the front to the back of the team, besides the ten in the lead, there were only three or four black voids in the militia."



"Very good," Roland immediately formed a preliminary combat plan in his mind, "You must all be hungry, right? Head to the dining hall first. Tell the chef whatever you want to eat."

"Honey-roasted meat coo!" Maggie spread her wings and declared proudly.

...

Outside the eastern end of the town.

Vanner glanced at the busy stonemasons and workers on both sides of the road, "What on earth are they building?"

Hundreds of people had first dug several large pits in the ground, then started piling up brick walls around the pits. He had thought these walls would connect at both ends to block the road, but it turned out they were being built around the pits.

"Who cares, I just know there's more enemies to beat up," Oak said as he excitedly secured the cannon carriage in place.

Indeed, Vanner thought. Since the last defeat of the Duke's coalition forces, His Highness the Prince had personally awarded each member of the artillery team with a bronze badge... no, a medal. The front of the medal featured the high wall emblem of Longsong Stronghold, and the back was engraved with the year and battle achievements. It was exquisitely made, making the musketeer squad green with envy.

Furthermore, in addition to this honor, everyone had been promoted. Vanner was now the captain of the artillery team, in charge of ten cannon crews. Rodney, Cat's Claw, and Oak had been promoted to crew leaders, with three of them transferred to newly established crews, teaching the recruits how to operate the cannons.



The most exhilarating part was that His Highness the Prince had kept his promise; Fan Na had been allocated a piece of land at the foot of the Impassable Mountain Range, to the east of the town. Although it was currently just a forest, a stone stele had already been erected, signifying that the rights to use the land belonged to him.



Therefore, when they received news that enemies intended to invade the town, the First Army immediately boiled with excitement, everyone eager and rubbing their hands in anticipation, hoping to distinguish themselves in the upcoming battle.



As dusk fell and the day’s drills came to an end, Fan Na wiped the sweat from his forehead and rested briefly on a gun carriage. He had spent the entire afternoon checking that the new recruits followed the correct procedures for firing the cannons, and his voice was almost hoarse from all the shouting.



"Have some water." Yu Pi handed him a water skin.



"Thank you." Fan Na unscrewed the cap and drank it all in one go.



"I think I know what they're building," the former said, lifting the corners of his mouth proudly.



"Oh?" He handed the water skin back. By this time, the brick wall had been built to half a person's height, roughly forming a hexagon around the pit. However, each wall had a narrow horizontal slit about thirty to forty centimeters from the ground, resembling a window but slightly narrower. "It's not a house, is it?"



"It's not wrong to call it a house," Yu Pi nodded, "I just asked a stonemason, and he told me it's something His Highness came up with. As long as the musketeers hide in this house that's half-buried underground and open fire, they won't have to worry about being attacked from behind. But it has a special name; His Highness calls it a 'bunker'."
