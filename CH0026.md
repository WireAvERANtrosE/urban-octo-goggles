## Experience of History
"Your Highness, what are you doing?" Carter had initially thought that the Fourth Prince was just a bit arbitrary, but now it had escalated to being whimsical.

When it came to training a warrior, the Chief Knight believed that no one was more professional than him. His family had a complete training method. From the age of ten to fifteen, in just five years, they could cultivate a warrior proficient in various weapons. If you add another five years, that would be a knight well-versed in upper-class etiquetteâ€”of course, the prerequisite was that the trainee must not be of common birth.

Look at this group of fools in front of him, all they have in their eyes is food! And... eggs are very expensive, okay!

Roland picked his ear, "Just watch, remember, the training in the next few days will also be carried out in this way. There will be some minor changes, and I will list them on paper."

In the age of cold weapons, training a batch of qualified soldiers in two or three months? Roland had no such idea, and he didn't need those Spartan warriors who could tear beasts apart with bare hands. The individual combat power of the army can be weak, but it must be strictly disciplined and obey orders.

The power of a team often surpasses that of the individual, which is determined by the social nature of humans. To quickly achieve this, it's a good choice to bring in the military training system and improve it according to the current environment. Based on his personal experience, it took only half a month to meld students from all over the country into one whole. Regardless of the process, the effect was very evident.

Only when this group of people fully understood what discipline was, could Roland implement the next step of his plan.

In the end, Van'er didn't get to eat the second egg.

This time, the standing period was more than twice as long as before. It didn't end until someone's legs were weak, and they couldn't help but sway from side to side.



The Fourth Prince announced a break for everyone and ordered the servants to distribute lunch. This successfully shifted the people's anger from the offender to the food, but it also made Fana suspect that the prince may never have intended for them to get the second reward. 



The lunch was contained in four large earthenware jars, which were brought to the outskirts of the town by several horse-drawn carriages. In addition to carrying the food, the carriages were also loaded with many wooden bowls and spoons.



As Fana licked his lips, ready to rush forward, the chief knight blocked everyone's path.



The prince ordered everyone to line up in four vertical lines to receive their tableware one by one. Anyone who disrupted the order would be forced to be the last to be allocated food.



The crowd pushed their way into four lines, and he was lucky enough to be at the front of the outermost line. Of course, some people expressed strong dissatisfaction, and there was a commotion in the line. Soon, the knight and several guards rushed into the crowd and drove the disruptors out.



"Fool," Fana sneered at the ringleader, the town's most belligerent "Mad Fist". Usually causing trouble everywhere with his brute strength, he was now being held at sword-point and obediently squatting aside. Look at his pitiful appearance! 



He felt that he had probably figured out the prince's preferences.



That was uniformity.



The line must stand straight, the line must be a single line, the queue for eating must be orderly, the order cannot be disrupted... Fana had heard a well-informed city merchant say that some nobles have a strange hobby, that is, everything must be arranged neatly, and if anything is slightly off, they will force themselves to organize it.



In Van'er's mind, such people were simply idle, with nothing to do, deliberately looking for trouble to torment themselves.

He didn't expect that His Royal Highness the Prince was such a person.

When the lid of the earthenware pot was lifted, Van'er smelled a rich aroma.

The scattered enticing scent almost intoxicated him, causing a stir among the crowd. Simultaneously, the roar of a knight came from the front. Probably another line was forming, he thought. 

Sure enough, the Fourth Prince asked everyone to line up to receive food in the order they had previously taken the wooden bowls and spoons.

Despite everyone swallowing their saliva and their stomachs growling, they all lined up obediently, taking the example of Mad Fist.

The earthenware pot was filled with steaming hot wheat porridge. To Van'er's surprise, there was even jerky in the porridge! Although only a thin slice was scooped into the wooden bowl, it was still meat! After serving the porridge, he also got an extra egg as he had wished.

Van'er almost wolfed down his lunch, even licking the bottom of the bowl. He didn't even have time to bite the egg, swallowing it whole. He ate so fast that he accidentally burned his tongue.

Putting down the wooden bowl, Van'er patted his stomach and belched. It had been a long time since he had enjoyed such delicious food. What was even more incredible was that he actually felt full. The sweet taste of the meat porridge was a world away from the black bread, and he even thought that if he could eat such food every day, what would it matter if he had to fight the demonic beasts on the front line?



After dinner was a relatively long rest period, everyone was taken back within the city walls, walking all the way to the camp where the patrolling soldiers lived. A burly foreign man walked out from the team and started teaching everyone how to set up tents.

Fanna knew him - there were few people living in the old street who didn't know Iron Axe. His exquisite archery skills left the most experienced old hunters in the town in awe. Wait, Iron Axe is now serving the Fourth Prince? It seemed that before he was always staying by the knight's side. Fanna frowned, what on earth was His Highness thinking? He was a Sand Person.

"Do you really plan to appoint a Sand Person as the captain?" Carter held the same question, "He does not belong to Greycastle, not even to the Continental Kingdom."

"Witches do not belong to Greycastle," Roland said indifferently, "But they all belong to Border Town. Besides, aren't you still here?"

"But, Your Highness..."

"Don't worry," Roland patted the knight's shoulder, "Border Town does not care about one's origin. As long as they do not violate the kingdom's laws, they are still my citizens. If you're really not at ease, you can pick two more outstanding ones as captains, anyway, the number of this team will expand in the future, it's not bad to cultivate a few more potentials now. By the way, I've written the training regulations, I think you should pay more attention to this than the Sand People."

Carter took the parchment roll from Roland's hand, skimmed it from beginning to end, and was immediately dumbfounded. The training content was unheard of - for example, leading everyone around Border Town in the afternoon, from Deer Hour (2 pm) until sunset. The regulation emphasized that everyone had to complete this, assistance was allowed along the way, and if no one gave up, an egg would be added to their dinner. Or, for example, blowing the assembly whistle immediately after the Wolf Hour in the evening, asking everyone to gather as quickly as possible. After such torment, the team would probably disband in a few days.

If the first few regulations could still be somewhat understood, the last one completely baffled Carter.

"Every evening after dinner, everyone will go to Mr. Karl's college for cultural training."



"Your Highness... what do you mean by cultural training? Don't tell me you're going to teach them how to read and write?"

"I wish I could, but time is too short. At most, I can only teach them some simple words and numbers, enough to read and write orders. I will personally explain this part to Karl, you just need to bring them to him."

"But, why would you do this? This is of no help in fighting the demonic beasts!"

"Who says?" Roland yawned, "A team proficient in combat, is inevitably a team with culture. This is a conclusion drawn from history."
