## Historical Experience
"Your Highness, what are you doing?" Carter had previously thought that the Fourth Prince was just being a bit headstrong, but now he had escalated to having whimsical ideas.



When it came to training a warrior, the Chief Knight felt that no one could be more professional than himself. His family had a complete set of training methods, which could cultivate a warrior skilled in various weapons in just five years, from the age of ten to fifteen. With another five years, one could become a knight well-versed in high society etiquette—of course, the premise was that the trainee could not be of commoner birth.



Looking at this bunch of fools before him, all they had in their eyes was food! And... eggs are very expensive, okay!



Roland dug at his ear, "Just watch, and remember, the training for the next few days should be conducted in the same way. Of course, there will be some detailed changes, which I will list on paper."



In an era of cold weapons, training a group of qualified soldiers in two or three months? Roland had no such idea, nor did he need those Spartan warriors who could tear beasts apart with their bare hands while wearing only shorts. An army's individual combat strength could be weak, but it had to maintain strict discipline and obey orders.



The power of a team often surpassed that of an individual, which is determined by the social nature of humans. To achieve this quickly, adapting the military training system and improving it based on the current environment was probably a good choice. Based on his personal experience, it was possible to meld students from all over the country into a single entity in just half a month, regardless of the process, the effect was quite evident.



Once these people fully understood what discipline was, Roland would then be ready to implement the next step of his plan.



Tanner ultimately did not get to eat a second egg.



This time, the duration of standing exceeded the previous time by more than double, ending only when someone's legs became weak, and they couldn't help but sway from side to side.



The fourth prince just happened to announce a break for everyone at this time and ordered his attendants to distribute lunch. This move successfully shifted the people's anger from the violator to the food, but it also made Tanner suspect that the prince probably never intended to give them the second reward.



Lunch was packed in four large earthen jars, hauled to the outskirts of town by several horse-drawn carriages. Besides carrying food, the carriages also bore many wooden basins and spoons.



As Tanner licked his lips, ready to rush forward, the Chief Knight barred everyone's way.



The prince commanded everyone to form four columns and come up one by one to receive their utensils. Anyone who disturbed the order would be forced to be the last one to receive food.



The crowd noisily formed four queues, and Tanner was lucky enough to be at the front of the outermost column. Of course, there were those who were strongly dissatisfied with this, and a scuffle broke out in the line. Soon, knights and several guards rushed into the crowd and drove out the troublemakers.



Fool, Tanner glanced at the ringleader of the disturbance, the town's most belligerent 'Mad Fist.' Usually relying on brute strength to cause trouble everywhere, he was now meekly squatting to one side with a sword pointed at him. Look at his pitiable state!



He felt that he had probably figured out the prince's preferences.



That is to be neat and uniform.



Lines must be straight, the queue must be a single line, meals require lining up, and order must not be interrupted... Tanner had once heard from a well-informed merchant from a large town that some nobles have a strange preference, which is that everything must be arranged neatly and orderly, and anything even slightly amiss would compel them to organize it.



In Tanner's mind, such people were purely idle, with nothing to do, so they deliberately found trouble to torment themselves.

He had not expected His Highness to be such a person.

When the lid of the clay pot was lifted, Tanner smelled a rich fragrance.

The tempting aroma that spread out almost intoxicated him, and there was a stir in the crowd, accompanied by the loud voice of a knight. It seemed they were going to line up again, he thought.

Sure enough, the Fourth Prince requested that everyone queue up in the same order as they had when they took their wooden bowls and spoons to receive food.

Although everyone was salivating and their stomachs were growling, considering the example set by Mad Fist, they all lined up obediently.

The clay pot contained steaming wheat porridge. Tanner was surprised to find that there was even jerky in the porridge! Even though only a thin slice was scooped into his wooden bowl, it was still meat! After scooping up the porridge, he also got an extra egg, much to his delight.

Tanner almost wolfed down his lunch, licking the bottom of the bowl clean. He didn’t even have time to bite the egg, swallowing it whole. Because he ate too quickly, he even accidentally scalded his tongue.

Putting down the wooden bowl, Tanner patted his stomach and belched. He had not enjoyed such delicious food for a long time. What was even more incredible was that he actually felt full. The sweet flavor of the meat porridge was a world apart from black bread, and he even thought that if he could eat food like this every day, what would it matter if he had to fight the demonic beasts on the front line?



After dinner, there was a rather long rest period. Everyone was brought back inside the town walls and walked to the garrison where the patrolling soldiers lived. A tall and burly foreign man stepped out from the ranks and began to teach everyone how to set up tents.

Tanner recognized him—there were few in Old Street who didn't know Iron Axe. His exquisite archery skills even made the most experienced hunters in town gasp in admiration. Wait, Iron Axe was working for the Fourth Prince now? It seemed that he had been seen staying close to the knight before. Tanner frowned, what exactly was His Highness thinking? He was a Sand Person, after all.



"Do you really intend to appoint a Sand Person as a captain?" Carter had the same doubts, "He doesn't belong to Graycastle, nor even to the kingdoms of the continent."



"Witches don't belong to Graycastle either," Roland said nonchalantly, "but they all belong to Border Town. Besides, you're here to keep an eye on things, aren't you?"



"But, Your Highness..."



"Don't worry," Roland patted the knight's shoulder, "Border Town does not care about one's origin. As long as they haven't violated the kingdom's laws, they are still my subjects. If you're really concerned, you can pick another two outstanding individuals to be captains. After all, this unit's numbers will continue to grow in the future, so it wouldn't hurt to cultivate a few with potential now. By the way, I've already written the training regulations, and I think you should pay more attention to that than to the Sand People."



Carter took the sheepskin scroll from Roland's hand and scanned it from start to finish, immediately dumbfounded. The training content was unheard of—such as taking everyone for a run around Border Town in the afternoon, from two in the afternoon until sunset. The regulations emphasized that everyone must complete this, with mutual assistance allowed on the way, and if no one gave up, an egg would be added to dinner. Another one was to blow the assembly whistle immediately at night, getting everyone to dress and assemble in the shortest possible time. With such exertion, it was feared that the unit might disperse in a few days.



If the previous regulations were somewhat understandable, the last one completely baffled Carter.



"Every evening after dinner, everyone goes to Mr. Karl's Academy for cultural training."



"Your Highness... what do you mean by cultural training? Surely you don't plan to teach them to read and write?"



"I wish I could, but there's not enough time. At most, we can only teach them some simple words and numbers, enough for them to read and write commands. I will explain this part personally to Karl. You just need to bring them over."



"But, why are you doing this? This has no use in fighting against demonic beasts!"



"Who says?" Roland yawned, "A team skilled in combat is necessarily a team that is cultured. This is a lesson learned from history."
