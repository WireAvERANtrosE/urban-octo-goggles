## Scouting Plan
Roland was sitting at his office desk, pondering how to launch an air raid on the royal palace of the capital, when suddenly there came a tapping sound from the French window behind him.

Turning around, he saw Lightning pressing against the window, her face filled with panic, while Maggie was squatting on her head, pecking at the window rapidly.

As soon as Nightingale opened the window, the little girl flung herself into Roland's arms.

"What's wrong," he asked, taken aback, "what happened?"

"Black stone coo! Huge snow mountain coo!" Maggie landed on the desk, flapping her wings as she reported.

"Ah?"

"It's none of those," Lightning said in a muffled voice, "it's the devil, I saw the devil!"

"What?" Roland's expression turned serious, he touched her head to calm her down, "Don't panic, take your time and tell me."

It took a while before Lightning looked up from the Prince's embrace, her short golden hair messy, and with two light red marks around her eye sockets, clearly from the goggles being pressed against her face during high-speed flight, "I planned to map out the border of the Misty Forest, so I followed the Redwater River westward, and then I came across a great mountain..."



After listening to her detailed account of what she had witnessed, Roland couldn't help but widen his eyes—the red mist that the demons relied on for survival was just behind the Impassable Mountain Range, and only a little more than two hundred kilometers away from the Western Region?



He looked at Nightingale, who nodded in response, "I'll go and call the other sisters over."

An emergency meeting was immediately convened in the castle's office.



After Roland recounted what Lightning had discovered to everyone, the witches who had experienced the Night of the Long Knives all showed uneasy expressions, especially Leaf. As a witch who had personally killed two demons, she couldn't help but cover her mouth and let out a low cry.



"Your Highness, I suggest further investigation into the area covered by the red mist," Scroll was the first to speak, "After all, Lightning only caught a glimpse from a great distance and couldn't confirm that the demons are definitely entrenched under the red mist. Moreover, even if this is confirmed, we should investigate whether they might cross the mountain range by the sea and reach the kingdom's mainland along the coast."



"I agree with Scroll's view," Wendy nodded, "Although they are very powerful, being prepared for defense is always better than being captured without a fight."



As the two oldest witches of the Witch Union, Scroll and Wendy had always been the backbone in the hearts of many sisters. Although the others were still somewhat afraid, no one wanted to just sit and wait for doom.



Roland also tended to agree with this strategy. Seeing that no one else had any objections, the matter was basically settled. The key was how to implement it.



"Let's use a hot-air balloon for reconnaissance," Anna suggested, "Cover the 'Twilight' with a sky camouflage, use the clouds as cover, and fly over from the sea."



"You can also bring Sylvie," Nightingale said, "Her ability is perfect for this situation."

"Um," Roland nodded, "Also... I'm going too."

"Your Highness!" As soon as he spoke, Wendy, Scroll, and Nightingale all tried to stop him at once, "You can't take this risk yourself!"

"It's not a risk," Roland waved his hand, "If they had the ability to fly across the sea or over mountains, they would have already spread across the four major kingdoms. The fact that they are still gathered in the far west just shows that the demons are not as terrifying as we imagined."

There was another reason he did not mention: judging the development level of an alien civilization, he had more experience than anyone else—seeing the demons and their cities with his own eyes would be extremely helpful for formulating future development directions and defense strategies.

"But..." Wendy hesitated.

"Don't worry, we're just going to take a look from afar," the prince smiled, "If even staying at a distance to scout is dangerous, I wouldn't have agreed to let you go in the first place."

"Well, okay, but you must take me with you." Seeing that persuasion was ineffective, Nightingale was the first to change her tune.

Looking at the serious eyes cast by the other party, Roland knew he could not refuse her. After pondering for a moment, he announced, "Then, aside from myself, the people going on this trip will be Anna, Wendy, Soraya, Sylvie, Nightingale, Lightning, and Maggie."



The departure time is set for one week later. In addition to the necessary food preparations, I will equip each of you with a revolver. Use this week to practice well. This way, even non-combat witches will have the ability to fight back against any enemy.



The speed of the hot air balloon is much slower than that of Lightning, and a journey of over two hundred kilometers will probably take a whole day to fly. Therefore, everyone will need to camp overnight in the wild to complete the reconnaissance. Considering this, dried food, tents, and weapons are all essentials.



"Yes, Your Highness," the witches responded in unison.



After everyone left, Roland finally had time to examine the black ore that Lightning had brought back.



"You're saying this kind of stone can be found everywhere on the edge of the forest?"



"Uh-huh," Lightning, now calm, sat beside the mahogany table swinging her feet, with her cheeks still slightly flushed, "And the closer you get to the foot of the mountain, the more there are. From the air, the black stones cover an area about a dozen times bigger than Border Town."



Roland weighed it in his hand, his heart skipping a beat.



In terms of weight, it was much lighter than ordinary stones, unlikely to be metallic ore. It was hard and light with a metallic luster on the surface and exposed above ground... Could it be a coal mine?



Thinking this, he hurriedly called Anna back.



Under the scorching of blackfire, the stone quickly turned bright red and translucent, looking very much like the iron ore in a smelting furnace, but it did not melt as a result. Even after withdrawing the blackfire, the orange glow it emitted did not diminish in the slightest, and a faint blue flame could be seen faintly rising from its surface.

Roland confirmed his own guess; this was indeed a block of high-quality anthracite.

"So this is what a coal mine looks like," Lightning exclaimed in surprise. "I thought they were all as fragile and crumbly as charcoal, and with lots of powder, that the slightest touch would dirty one's palm."

"That's the pulverized, water-mixed coal balls and coal cakes," Roland said with a smile. "Most coal mines are just like stones when they are mined, and of course, the higher quality the raw coal, the harder it is. In the end, it's like these stones, with surfaces that can even reflect a shine."

This unexpected discovery delighted him.

Coal was not rare in Greycastle. Both Dragon Cliffs City and Silver City had coal mines, mostly used for firing kilns and heating. But in reality, its uses were extremely broad. Before the popularization of internal combustion engines, it was the burning coal that supported half the sky of steam power. After coal is coked, it can replace charcoal for smelting iron and steel, which is much more environmentally friendly than cutting down trees on a large scale. Even after entering the electrical era, coal could still be processed into coal gas, hydrogen, and asphalt, and used to generate electricity, making it a great and inexpensive fuel.

Having an open-pit coal mine in hand was obviously much better than relying on imports. The only question was, how to develop it?

Roland shifted his gaze to the new map that Lightning had drawn.

It seemed that building more inland steam cement ships was imperative.
