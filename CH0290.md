## Scouting Plan
Roland sat at his desk, pondering how to launch an air raid on the royal palace of the king's city, when suddenly there was a tapping sound from the floor-to-ceiling window behind him.

Turning around, he saw Lightning pressing against the window with a look of panic on her face, while Maggie was perched on top of her head, rapidly pecking at the window.

As soon as Nightingale opened the window, the little girl threw herself into Roland's arms.

"What's wrong," he said, startled, "what happened?"

"The black stones, coo! The huge snow mountains, coo!" Maggie landed on the desk, flapping her wings and reporting.

"Ah?"

"It's not that," Lightning said in a muffled voice, "I saw the devil, I saw the devil!"

"What?" Roland's expression turned serious, he touched her head to steady her emotions, "Don't panic, take your time and tell me."

It took a while before Lightning raised her head from the prince's embrace, her golden hair messy and two faint red marks around her eyes, obviously caused by the goggles during high-speed flight, "I was planning to map out the border of the Misty Forest, so I followed the Redwater River westward, and then I came across a big mountain..."



After listening to her detailed account of what she had seen and heard, Roland couldn't help but widen his eyes. The red mist that the demons relied on for survival was just behind the snowy mountains, and it was only a little over two hundred kilometers away from the Western Region?



He looked at Nightingale, who nodded. "I'll go and call the other sisters over."



An emergency meeting was immediately convened in the castle office.



After Roland recounted Lightning's discovery to everyone, the witches who had experienced the Night of the Witch Hunt showed a unanimous look of unease, especially Leaf. As a witch who had killed two demons with her own hands, she couldn't help but cover her mouth and gasp.



"Your Highness, I suggest we conduct further reconnaissance on the land covered by the red mist," Scroll was the first to speak. "After all, Lightning only took a few glances from a great distance and we cannot be certain that the demons are definitely lurking beneath the red mist. Moreover, even if this is confirmed, we must investigate whether they will cross the mountains by the sea and reach the kingdom's mainland along the coastline."



"I agree with Scroll," Wendy nodded. "Although they are very powerful, it's always better to be prepared for defense than to be caught without a fight."



As the two oldest witches in the Witch Union, Scroll and Wendy had always been the backbone for many of their sisters. Although the others were still somewhat afraid, none of them wanted to just sit and wait for doom.



Roland also favored this strategy, and seeing that no one had any objections, the matter was basically settled. The key was how to implement it.



"Let's use a hot-air balloon for reconnaissance," Anna suggested. "We can cover the 'Sight' with sky camouflage, using the clouds as cover, and fly over from the sea."



"We could also take Sylvie with us," Nightingale suggested, "Her ability is perfect for this situation."

"Right," Roland nodded, "Additionally... I want to go too."

"Your Highness!" As soon as he spoke, Wendy, Scroll, and Nightingale all tried to stop him at once, "You can't take this risk yourself!"

"It's not a risk," Roland waved his hand dismissively, "If they had the ability to fly across the sea or over mountains, they would have spread across the four kingdoms by now. The fact that they're still congregated in the far west only shows that the demons aren't as terrifying as we imagine."

There was another reason he didn't voice; when it came to assessing the development level of an alien civilization, he had more experience than anyone elseâ€”seeing the demons and their city with his own eyes would greatly aid in formulating future development directions and counter-strategies.

"But..." Wendy hesitated.

"Don't worry, we'll just take a look from a distance," the prince smiled, "If even scouting from afar is dangerous, I wouldn't have agreed to let you go in the first place."

"Well, okay, but you must take me with you." Seeing that her persuasion was ineffective, Nightingale was the first to change her stance.

Looking at her serious gaze, Roland knew he couldn't refuse her. After pondering for a moment, he declared, "Then, aside from myself, the party will include Anna, Wendy, Soraya, Sylvie, Nightingale, Lightning, and Maggie."



"The departure will be in a week. In addition to the necessary food preparations, I will equip each of you with a revolver. Take this week to practice well, so that even non-combat witches will have the ability to counter any enemy they face."

The speed of a hot air balloon is far less than that of lightning; a journey of over two hundred kilometers will probably take an entire day to fly, so everyone will need to camp out in the wilderness for a night to complete the reconnaissance. Considering this, dry food, tents, and weapons are all essentials.

"Yes, Your Highness," the witches responded in unison.

After everyone had left, Roland finally had time to examine the black ore that Lightning had brought back.

"You're saying that this kind of stone can be found everywhere at the edge of the forest?"

"Mhm," Lightning had now regained her composure, sitting at the mahogany table and swinging her feet, her cheeks still flushed with a hint of redness, "And the closer to the foot of the mountain, the more there are. From an aerial view, the area covered by the black stones is about more than ten times larger than Border Town."

Roland weighed it in his hand, his heart skipping a beat.

In terms of weight, it was much lighter than ordinary stones, making it unlikely to be a metal ore. Hard and light on the outside, reflecting a metallic luster, and exposed on the surface... could it be a coal mine?

With that thought, he hastily called Anna back.



Under the scorching of the blackfire, the stone quickly became red and translucent, looking very much like the iron ore in a smelting furnace, but it did not melt as a result. Even after the blackfire was withdrawn, the orange light it emitted did not diminish at all, and one could even see a faint blue flame rising from its surface.



Roland confirmed his speculation; this was indeed a high-quality anthracite.



"So this is what a coal mine looks like," Lightning said in surprise. "I thought they were all as fragile and crumbly as charcoal, and with lots of powder that would dirty your palm with just a touch."



"That's because you're thinking of crushed coal that's been moistened and processed into briquettes and cakes," Roland laughed. "Most coal mines look just like rocks when they're mined, and naturally, the higher quality the raw coal, the harder it is. In the end, they're just like these stones, with surfaces that can even reflect a sheen."



This unexpected discovery delighted him.



Coal was not rare in Graycastle, with coal mines present in Fallen Dragon Ridge and Silver City, mostly used for kilns and heating. But in fact, its uses were extremely diverse. Before internal combustion engines became widespread, it was the burning coal that supported half the sky of steam power. After coal was turned into coke, it could replace charcoal for iron smelting and steel making, which was much more environmentally friendly than massive deforestation. Even after entering the era of electricity, coal could still be turned into coal gas, hydrogen, and asphalt, and used for power generation, making it a cheap and excellent fuel.



Holding an open-pit coal mine in his hands was clearly much better than relying on imports. The only problem was, how should he develop it?



Roland's gaze shifted to the new map drawn by Lightning.



It seems that building more inland steam concrete ships is imperative.
