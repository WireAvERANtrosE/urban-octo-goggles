## "Swarm"
The mirror issue was ultimately resolved by Soraya.

She referred to the mercury obtained from the laboratory and directly painted a shiny coating on the back of the glass, similar to the effect of a mercury mirror, and also avoided the risk of mercury vapor poisoning.

Compared to mirrors with silver foil, mirrors with an overall coating had better reflectivity. Roland promptly cleared out a batch of crystal glassware, producing a small, portable mirror for each witch. This kind of gift, which allowed them to clearly see their own appearance, delighted all the witches. Even Scroll, who usually maintained a serene expression, showed a smile, making him have to marvel at the fact that, although witches could not bear children, they were still essentially women.

Unfortunately, these convenient daily necessities could not yet be sold to the public at a low price, as the crystal glass used as the base material was expensive, and the laboratory also needed to consume a large amount of glass to produce colorless, transparent containers. Kymo Stew was indeed knowledgeable about how to make colorless glass, but the laboratory was too busy with tasks to spare any manpower—most apprentices were occupied with purifying acids and soaking guncotton, while the Chief Alchemist was engrossed with a few disciples in overcoming the major hurdle of fulminate of mercury. Until the industrial method of acid production was developed, they could not think of producing anything else.

In addition to the reflective mirror, the method of moving the object distance was also changed from finger movement of the stage to knob control of the tube body. For these improvements, Roland only needed to give a couple of hints, and Anna would understand immediately. With Blackfire processing, the new fixture was quickly completed, and by selecting two sets of tubes with the highest magnification, the first batch of complete optical microscopes was obtained.

Taking advantage of the abundant afternoon sunlight, Roland gathered all the members of the Witch Union in the backyard of the castle, and the first natural biology class officially began.

...

When Lily entered the backyard, she noticed that the plants here had grown even more luxuriant.

The grapes on the trellis had turned a vibrant purple-red, and she remembered that it had been less than a week since they last ripened. Lightning occasionally flew up, plucking a bunch of ripe grapes to toss to everyone. And that big clumsy bird, which had recently joined Border Town, simply stood on the trellis, pecking at the grapes and swallowing them whole.



Under the shade in the center of the backyard, His Highness the Prince and Anna were chatting about something, looking like an intimate couple, but Lily knew for sure they weren't whispering sweet nothings. If she were to get closer and listen carefully, she would definitely hear a bunch of incomprehensible terms and confusing debates... things like what a little ball looks like, a cat that is both dead and alive, matter turning into waves, and so on. Perhaps that was why Nightingale kept a distance of more than five meters from the two—listening for too long would definitely make one sleepy!



Wendy was always with her books, her expression gentle and smiling at all times. Sometimes Lily even felt that when Wendy looked at her, it was as if she was looking at a child. Lily sighed helplessly, glanced at Wendy's chest, then looked down at her own, acknowledging the vast difference.



When would she stop being considered a child?



After all the witches had gathered, Prince Roland placed two gray-black metal devices on the table, which must be the microscopes he claimed could let one see the minutiae of the world. Lily thought that perhaps objects would indeed look different when magnified, but the idea that everything in the world was made up of little balls? She found that hard to believe—how could round balls possibly make up a solid rock?



His Highness asked a guard to bring a bucket of water, took a few drops, and placed them under the microscope—contrary to Lily's expectations, the water in the bucket was neither muddy nor dirty. Under the light, it was crystal clear, seemingly empty of anything. Could it be... that under the microscope, one could really see tiny balls flowing?



"There's something moving in the water!" To her surprise, the exclamations of her sisters rose one after another, "Ah, it ran away!"



"There's not just one, there seems to be many."



"My god, are these insects? They all look different!"



"This one looks like a transparent crab..."



Lily's heart was instantly lifted with anticipation—were they not little spheres but insects instead? His Highness must indeed be deceiving them! But... having insects would also be strange, she thought. Just a moment ago, there was clearly nothing in the water! When it was her turn, the young girl could no longer pretend to be indifferent; she eagerly squinted her eyes and brought her head close to the microscope.



Then she witnessed an incredible scene.



Within the narrow aperture, many oddly shaped objects were swimming around unrestrained. Some were square-shaped with soft hair all over them, some resembled a mix between beetles and crabs, and others were similar to wheat grains with legs. No matter how peculiar their shapes were, most of them were transparent, as if they lacked shells or skin, allowing a clear view of their insides—of course, these insects' bellies were almost entirely empty.



"Your Highness, are these really insects?" Scroll asked.



"What you see are probably protozoa or single-celled algae. Calling them insects is not quite accurate; they should be classified as microorganisms," the prince explained.



"Microorganisms?"



"Yes, they are also a form of independent life, but much smaller. Besides the two types you are observing, there are even smaller bacteria and viruses. The current magnification of the microscope is insufficient to observe these two types of microorganisms, and they are the cause of food spoilage and various diseases," Prince Roland explained with increasing interest. "These tiny life forms are everywhere, in vast numbers. Fortunately, most of them cannot withstand high temperatures, which is why we boil water before drinking it, cook fish and meat thoroughly, and don't reuse bathwater—it's all for this reason."



Although it was hard to imagine there could be creatures even smaller than these, the thought of having swallowed a bunch of these insects while drinking water made Lily's skin crawl.



And to think that these inconspicuous little things were the culprits behind food spoilage?



If bread and meat porridge could be kept fresh, then water... should be able to as well, right?

With this thought, she couldn't help but release her magic power, covering the droplet of water under the microscope.

An unexpected transformation occurred.

She saw a portion of the "bugs" begin to tremble, then rapidly change their appearance. Their previously transparent exoskeletons were no longer visible, now clad in purple armor, with tentacles sprouting all around, beginning to devour the surrounding unchanged bugs. No, not devouring—Lily saw that they were assimilating the others at an astonishing rate. The tentacles, like sharp thin swords, would pierce into the other microorganisms, and then transform them into their own likeness.

She wasn't sure if it was an illusion, but she felt that these mutated swarms were also altering those invisible life forms. Soon, specks of purple light appeared in the water. In a matter of breaths, more and more specks gradually connected, laying down a layer of light purple carpet within her field of vision. The tentacled bugs aligned themselves on this carpet, as orderly as a military parade. As if sensing her attention, they all raised their tentacles, as though saluting in respect.

For the first time, she saw the true face of her own ability.
