## "The Swarm"
The mirror problem was ultimately solved by Soraya.

She made use of the mercury obtained from the laboratory and directly painted a layer of shiny coating on the back of the glass, creating an effect similar to that of a mercury mirror, which also eliminated the risk of mercury vapor poisoning.

Compared to mirrors that had silver sheets adhered to them, mirrors with an overall painted surface had better reflectivity. Roland simply allocated a batch of crystal glassware and made a small, portable mirror for each witch. This kind of gift, which allowed them to clearly see their own appearance, delighted all the witches. Even Scroll, who was usually calm and composed, showed a smile, prompting him to remark that although witches could not conceive, they were still essentially women.

Unfortunately, these convenient daily necessities could not be sold to the public at a low price for the time being, as the crystal glass used as the base material was expensive. Additionally, the laboratory needed to consume a large amount of glass to produce colorless and transparent containers. Kyle Sichi understood how to make colorless glass, but the laboratory was too busy to spare any manpower—the majority of apprentices were occupied with purifying acids, soaking guncotton, and the Chief Alchemist was engrossed with a few disciples in overcoming the critical barrier of mercury fulminate. Until an industrial method for acid production was developed, they could hardly think about making anything else.

Aside from the reflective mirrors, the method of moving the object distance also changed from manually adjusting the stage with fingers to controlling the movement of the tube body with a knob. Roland only needed to give a couple of hints for Anna to grasp the idea immediately. With her Blackfire processing, the new mounting stands were quickly completed, and by selecting two sets of tubes with the highest magnification, they obtained the first batch of complete optical microscopes.

Taking advantage of the abundant afternoon sunlight, Roland gathered all the members of the Witch Union in the backyard of the castle, where the first official lesson on natural biology began.

...

When Lily entered the backyard, she noticed that the plants here had become even more luxuriant.

The grapes on the trellis had already turned into a bright purple-red color, and she remembered it had been less than a week since they last ripened. Lightning occasionally flew up, plucking a ripe bunch of grapes to share with everyone. And that big, clumsy bird, which had recently joined Border Town, simply perched directly on the trellis, pecking at the grapes and swallowing them down.



Under the shade in the center of the backyard, His Highness the Prince was chatting with Anna, looking like an intimate couple, but Lily knew they were definitely not whispering sweet nothings to each other. If she approached and listened carefully, she would undoubtedly hear a bunch of incomprehensible terms and confusing debates... such as what small spheres looked like, cats that were both dead and alive, and matter turning into waves, and so on. Perhaps that was the reason why Nightingale kept a distance of more than five meters from the two of them—listening for too long would definitely make one drowsy!



Wendy, on the other hand, was always with her books, wearing a smile at all times, her expression gentle. Sometimes Lily even felt that the way Wendy looked at her was like looking at a child. Lily sighed helplessly, glanced at Wendy's chest, then looked down at her own, and indeed there was a world of difference.



When will I no longer be considered a child, when I grow like that?



After all the witches had gathered, Prince Roland placed two gray-black metal instruments on the table, which must be the microscopes he claimed could reveal the microscopic world. Lily thought that perhaps objects would indeed look different when magnified, but everything in the world is made up of small spheres? She always found it hard to believe that round spheres could make up a solid rock.



His Highness asked the guards to bring a bucket of water, took a few drops, and placed them under the microscope—contrary to Lily's expectation, the water in the bucket was neither turbid nor dirty. Under the light, it was crystal clear, seemingly empty. Could it be... that under the microscope, one could really see the moving spheres?



"There's something moving in the water!" To her surprise, exclamations from her sisters rose one after another, "Ah, it ran away!"



"There's more than one, and there seem to be a lot of them."



"My goodness, are these bugs? They all look different!"



"This one looks like a transparent crab..."



Lily's heart instantly tightened—were they not little spheres but insects instead? His Highness was indeed deceiving people! But... it was still strange to have insects, there was clearly nothing in the water just now! When it was her turn, the young girl could no longer pretend to be indifferent. She eagerly squinted her eyes and brought her head close to the microscope.



Then she witnessed an incredible scene.



Within the narrow aperture, many oddly-shaped objects were swimming about unrestrained. Some were square with soft hair all around, some looked like a cross between beetles and crabs, and others resembled grains of wheat with legs. No matter how bizarre their shapes were, most of them were transparent, as if they had no shell or skin, allowing a clear view into their bodies—of course, these insects had almost nothing inside their bellies.



"Your Highness, are these really all insects?" Scroll asked.



"What you are seeing are probably protozoa or unicellular algae; it's not quite right to call them insects. They should be classified as microorganisms," the prince explained.



"Microorganisms?"



"Yes, they are also a form of independent life, only much smaller in size. Apart from the two types you see, there are even smaller ones, like bacteria and viruses. The current magnification of the microscope is not sufficient to observe these microorganisms, but they are the cause of food spoilage and various diseases," Prince Roland explained with increasing interest, "These tiny life forms are omnipresent and numerous. Fortunately, most of them do not withstand high temperatures, which is why it's important to drink boiled water, to cook fish and meat thoroughly, and not to reuse bathwater. That's the reason for these practices."



Although it was hard to imagine there were creatures even smaller than these, the thought of having swallowed a whole bunch of insects while drinking water made Lily involuntarily shudder with goosebumps.



And His Highness said these inconspicuous little things were the culprits behind food spoilage?



If bread and meat porridge could be preserved, then water... should be able to as well, right?

Thinking of this, she couldn't help but release her magic power, covering the droplet of water under the microscope.

An unexpected change occurred.

She saw some of the "bugs" start to tremble, then quickly change their appearance. Their exteriors were no longer transparent, instead, they appeared to don purple armor, with tentacles growing all around, beginning to devour the surrounding unchanged bugs. No... not devour, Lily saw that they were assimilating the others at an astonishing rate. The tentacles, like sharp fine swords, would penetrate the bodies of other microorganisms, transforming them into the same form.

She wasn't sure if it was an illusion, but she felt that these mutated swarms were also altering those invisible life forms. Soon, specks of purple light appeared in the water. After a few breaths, more and more spots gradually connected into a sheet, laying out like a light purple carpet within her field of vision. The tentacle bugs were neatly arrayed on this carpet, as orderly as an army. As if sensing her attention, all their tentacles rose up, as if saluting her in respect.

For the first time, she saw the true face of her own ability.
