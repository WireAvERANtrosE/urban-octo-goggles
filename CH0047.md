## Market and Circulation
Over the past week, Border Town had been relatively peaceful.

According to Iron Axe and Brian, the intensity and number of demonic beasts would gradually increase as the Months of Demons continued. Taking advantage of the current low defensive pressure, Roland sent another single-masted sailboat filled with ore to Willow Town.

With the Steam Engine Mark I put into use, the number of workers at the North Slope Mine had been halved, yet the output was steadily increasing and had now returned to the level before the collapse. With machinery taking over, there was a significant saving in manpower.

At the same time, Roland made preliminary reforms to the production system in the mining area, changing from a fixed salary to a piece-rate salary. He had Barov calculate the average daily output from the previous years and set it as the standard; workers would receive additional compensation for each certain increment in production, with special rewards for those who discovered gemstone veins. This measure effectively promoted the workers' enthusiasm for production, creating a bustling scene throughout the mining area.

With surplus ore in hand, Roland naturally wanted to do something.

In addition to incorporating the Steam Engine Mark II into the production plan, he also planned to manufacture a batch of manual machine tools.

Machine tools have a long history; in layman's terms, they are essentially workbenches used for processing tools. Thus, the anvil can be regarded as the most primitive form of machine tool—manually fixed, hand-forged.

Hand-forging was manageable, but manual fixing was too inconvenient, so people added clamps or grooves to the bench to secure the parts being processed. For instance, the barrels of early matchlock and flintlock guns were hand-hammered on anvils with grooves.

Later, as manual hammering and milling could no longer meet processing needs, machine tools diversified. According to different purposes, they adopted various fixation methods and processing tools, combining manual and mechanical operations, which effectively improved the inconsistency of force applied in pure manual labor.



Roland was thinking about a manual milling machine.

Despite the milling machine's variety of functions, he was mainly interested in machining involute gears, so its structure could be accordingly simplified. It required only a pair of clamps to secure the gear disk, and a rotatable steel grinding disk. With Anna's help, it was easy to create a grinding disk specifically for cutting gears—after shaping the top of the grinding tool into a trapezoid and heating it to red-hot, an iron bar was used to scrape marks on it, followed by quenching in water to produce a custom grinding disk with high rigidity.

After solving the key problem, Roland immediately called for Carter, instructing him to hire two carpenters to build a base for the milling machine, while Anna continued to manufacture other metal parts in the castle's backyard.

It must be said, with Anna, metalworking became as easy as molding clay, especially after she had mastered the control of her flames. Now, for the initial processing of small parts, she shaped them with her hands. Watching how she melted the iron ingot into a viscous liquid and then kneaded it, Roland was endlessly amazed.

Without witches, these plans in his mind might have been delayed for over a decade.

Two days later, the first simple milling machine appeared in the backyard.

During this time, Roland was not idle. Designing gears could be considered his old trade, and he had designed a set of gear assemblies for the purpose of adjusting the speed and stabilizing the output of the steam engine. The corresponding gear disks were already cast, just waiting for the milling machine to be assembled before starting the gear milling process.

Gears were not a novelty; most mines in this world relied on livestock to pull wooden gears and winding mechanisms for drainage. This time, the Chief Knight finally felt satisfied—he had run errands for His Highness so many times, and at last, he could understand what the other party intended to do.

Roland also had him bring along three blacksmiths and their apprentices to learn how to use the milling machine in the yard. He could not operate these machines personally every day, so it was essential to train a group of skilled workers.



After everyone had respectfully completed their salutations, Roland began demonstrating how to use the milling machine to process gears.

He didn't mind acting as a senior fitter in front of everyone. In fact, in this era, there were princes of all kinds with a wide variety of hobbies, and given his own reputation for unorthodox behavior, he felt no pressure operating the machine tool.

The Chief Knight was responsible for pouring warm pig lard on his behalf—in an era without machine oil, using pig lard was somewhat wasteful, but it was better than nothing. After the lard was poured over the grinding disc, it would fall into the ceramic basin below and could be reused.

Roland first marked the gear plate with the designed tooth pitch marks, then stood the gear plate up and secured it to the workbench. Next, he moved the grinding disc above the gear plate, aligned it with the markings, and stepped on the pedal. The pedal drove the wooden wheel, which, through the belt, transferred power to the grinding disc's spindle.

After that, he steadied the grinding disc handle with his hand and gently pulled down; the rotating grinding disc then slowly cut into the gear plate at a 90-degree angle.

Since the gear plate was made of cast iron and the grinding disc was made of quenched steel, cutting the tooth marks was not very laborious. The aroma of pig lard filled the air, making the blacksmiths and apprentices who hadn't tasted meat for a long time all swallow their saliva in unison.

After the demonstration, it was time to sign the contract. Border Town's commerce was still in its infancy, and industry was even more so; neither steam engines nor machine tools would be immediately snapped up by various shops as soon as they were manufactured. In this era, most people would not realize the great significance of these items and their potential commercial value. Therefore, Roland had to take the initiative to promote the use of machinery.

In the contract, he stipulated that the blacksmith shops using the milling machine needed to process at least one set of gears per week, with the required materials provided by the castle, and the processing fee set at ten silver royals. At the same time, there was a machinery usage fee of two silver royals per week. This was because the set of machine tools was not given to the blacksmith shops for free, but was more akin to a lease.

After entering the Evil Months, the business of the blacksmith shops had also declined quite a bit, so having an opportunity to earn money, especially an order personally given by His Royal Highness, naturally met with no objections. At the same time, Roland told them that this was just the first milling machine, and more would be produced one after another. Those interested could submit an application to the town hall.



"Your Highness, why not directly write the processing fee as 8 silver royals on the contract?" Carter asked in puzzlement after the blacksmiths had left.

"The two numbers might be the same, but they carry different meanings," Roland explained. "This is probably the first commercial lease contract in Border Town, and I need to establish an industry standard."

The Chief Knight wiped his forehead; it seemed that the Fourth Prince was speaking nonsense again. However, he was experienced in dealing with this and knew that as long as he appeared to listen attentively, His Highness would continue to elaborate.

"A good start can lead to a virtuous cycle. At the moment, I am the only one in need of gears, so I provide the machine tools, they contribute the manpower, and the compensation they receive is in the form of wages. In the future, when others have similar needs, they will realize that buying the machine tools and producing on their own will earn them much more than just wages," Roland paused, "In this way, when faced with new things, they can initially avoid risk by using substitute production methods, I can also gain returns through leasing, and the further development of new things will be determined by market demand. This is what creates a virtuous cycle."
