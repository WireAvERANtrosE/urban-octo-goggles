## Return to Town
"This is probably the day I've seen you lie the most," Nightingale said as she materialized from the mist after Thylo left.

"What choice do I have when the visitor is the Church's High Priest?" Roland spread his hands. "So, can you tell if he was lying?"

"No, the scenery around him was engulfed by God's Punishment Stones, and I could only see darkness."

It's a pity that we can't treat the High Priest the same way we treat the nobles, Roland thought regretfully. He placed the two pills on the table, "What do you think, are they as miraculous as they claim?"

Morphine can relieve pain, and the effect of making soldiers incredibly strong sounds like adrenaline, but extracting both substances and making them into pills? If the Church had this level of technology, they should have conquered the world by now.

Wait a moment... Roland suddenly thought of a possibility. Could it have something to do with magical power?

"You can see the flow of magic, right?" he looked at Nightingale. "Is there magic in these two pills?"

Nightingale scrutinized them carefully, "I can't see any magic, but it somewhat resembles God's Punishment Stones."

"God's Punishment Stones?" Roland was stunned.



"Indeed," she nodded, "You've also seen the world beneath the fog, a world of only black and white. But the darkness formed by the God's Punishment Stones is different—it's more like a void that devours the world around it. I don't know how to describe that feeling..." Nightingale hesitated, "Rather than saying the inside of the hole is pitch-black, it's more like there's nothing inside at all."



"A void?"



"Exactly, a void," she nodded, "These two pills bear traces of that void, though very faintly... and they are not shaped like round holes, but rather like strands of flowing black silk."



"Can this void affect your abilities?"



Nightingale grabbed the pills, unfolded the Mist, and quickly withdrew, "It doesn't seem to have any effect."



"It seems necessary to find a death row prisoner to test the effects of these two pills." Roland carefully wrapped the pills in paper and tucked them into his chest.



"I didn't expect the Church to think so highly of you." Nightingale sat back down next to the prince, with a somewhat sullen tone.



"If the High Priest wasn't wearing a God's Punishment Stone, I would bet nine out of ten of his words were lies." Roland curled his lips, "The most important point is, what they do and what they seek, simply don't match up."



"Why?"



"Look at what they desire: more churches, more believers, a prince or a king who they can prop up themselves, thereby cementing the propaganda of divine right of kings. A stable state is more conducive for them to expand their congregation and grow their influence. Otherwise, in the midst of constant warfare, churches and monasteries would also become targets of robbery for refugees and nobles."



"But aren't they focusing on you because you can bring a stable life to the people?"



"Not really," Roland shook his head, "Stability comes from unity or balance, and even if a king indulges in luxury every day, the people of a unified kingdom still live better than refugees in war. Therefore, it's not surprising that they support the Second Prince or the Third Princess, but it is strange for them to come support me—especially when Grace has achieved a sweeping victory."



If the church were to fully support Grace now, it's likely that the royal capital and the areas along the eastern front wouldn't last half a year before being completely swallowed by her. At that point, seventy percent of the Kingdom of Greycastle's territory would fall into the hands of Queen Clearwater, Roland thought, and the pressure he faced would increase significantly. Not helping the strong but choosing to support himself, who seemed the weakest at the moment, appeared to be a decision in his favor by the church. However, if he were to accept their support, the struggle between the two kings of Greycastle would become even more chaotic. The direct consequence of this otherworldly version of the Three Kingdoms would be a significant reduction in population, rapid loss of wealth, the spread of war throughout the country, and a further delayed unification date.



What good would that do for the church? Never mind expanding their congregation; they'd probably see the churches built all over the place completely dismantled.



"I don't understand your noble thoughts, always so roundabout," Nightingale sighed.



"Hmm," Roland responded with a smile, "Except for me."



"..." The witch narrowed her eyes and glared at the prince for a long time, "Strange, why is that also true?"



Three days later, Roland finally emptied the castle and Stronghold's library, and contentedly set off on his return journey aboard the "Littletown."



As they approached Border Town along the Redwater River, the scenery on both banks had changed. On the empty land opposite the town, burned out by Anna, many people were busily moving about—judging by their dress, they should be the serfs who had been sent to the town in advance. On this side, closer to the Impassable Mountain Range, many simple wooden sheds had been set up, and there were faint signs of people moving inside; Roland guessed that these people were the families of the serfs.



These people had been tied to the land for generations, and the children born to them were also serfs. Seeing no hope, most of them lived numb lives, driven not by an inner desire to work but by the whips and nooses in the hands of their masters. The low productivity was simply a tremendous waste of human resources.



Without a doubt, slavery was the enemy of industrial production, a system that had to be abolished. But Roland was not planning to wave his hand and make them all free citizens at once; instead, he wanted to provide a channel for them to see the hope of being promoted to free citizens—since there were precedents for masters liberating slaves out of kindness, this compromise approach would not have too great an impact even if it spread, at most making other nobles think he was just too soft-hearted.



When the time was ripe in the future, he would implement the abolition of slavery in full, and the resistance would be much less.



The wharf was crowded with sailboats, clearly overburdened by such heavy transportation pressure. Fortunately, the "Littletown" had a shallow draft and could come ashore directly without a dock. It seems that expanding the dock needed to be scheduled as well, Roland thought.



After the group returned to the castle, he didn't have time to rest; he went straight to his office and immediately called for Barov to report on the reception of supplies.



The Minister Assistant was well-prepared, pulling out a roll of parchment from his pocket and spreading it out on the large wooden table.



"Your Highness, the things you've brought back to the castle these days have really scared me," he said, though the folds on his face betrayed his true feelings, "It took twelve apprentices all night to count the various coins, a total of more than fourteen thousand Gold royals! Your Highness, that's equivalent to the income of an ordinary town for a whole year!"



The Duke must have spent more than twenty years accumulating these Gold royals, Roland thought, from the plundering, looting, and exploitation of the Western Region's people. He needed to quickly turn them into food, steel, and machinery. "What about the jewels, jewelry, and crafts?"



"I haven't had the chance to do the conversion yet, but conservatively estimated, it's also around ten thousand gold royals. If it's sent to the capital for auction, the price could be even higher. Right now, they are all stored in the basement of your castle," Barov paused, "However, this means that the rooms originally used for storing food will not be sufficient. I suggest that you expand the castle area and add warehouses to store other supplies."
