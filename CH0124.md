## Return to Town
"This is probably the day I've seen you lie the most," Nightingale emerged from the mist after Theo left and said.

"What choice do I have when the visitor is the Grand Bishop of the Church?" Roland spread his hands. "So, can you tell if he's lying?"

"I can't. His surroundings were devoured by the Divine Stone of Judgement, and all I can see is darkness."

It's a pity that we can't treat the Grand Bishop like we do the nobles, Roland thought regretfully. He placed the two pills on the table, "What do you think, are these things really as miraculous as they say?"

Morphine can relieve pain, and as for making soldiers incredibly strong, it sounds like the effect of adrenaline, but to extract these two substances to make pills? If the Church had that level of technology, they should have conquered the world already.

Wait a minute... Roland suddenly thought of a possibility. Could it be related to magic power?

"You can see the flow of magic power, right?" he looked towards Nightingale. "Is there magic power in these two pills?"

Nightingale observed carefully for a while, "I can't see any magic power, but it does resemble the Divine Stone of Judgement a bit."

"The Divine Stone of Judgement?" Roland was taken aback.



"Mmm," she nodded, "You have also seen the world beneath the mist, with only black and white colors, but that kind of black is different from the darkness formed by the Divine Stone of Judgement. The latter is more like a void that swallows the surrounding world into it. I don’t know how to describe that feeling..." Nightingale hesitated, "Rather than saying the hole is pitch black, it's more like there is nothing inside."



"Nothingness?"



"That's right, nothingness," she nodded, "These two pills also bear traces of nothingness, but very faint, and... not like round holes, but more like strands of flowing black silk."



"Can this nothingness affect your abilities?"



Nightingale grabbed the pills, unfolded the mist, and soon came out again, "It doesn't seem to have any effect."



"It seems necessary to find a condemned prisoner to test the effects of these two pills." Roland carefully wrapped the pills in paper and tucked them into his chest.



"I didn't expect the church to think so highly of you," Nightingale said, sitting back next to the prince, somewhat sullenly.



"If the High Priest wasn't wearing the Divine Stone of Judgement, I'd bet nine out of ten sentences he says are lies," Roland scoffed, "The most important point is that what they do and what they seek don't match up at all."



"Why?"



"Look at what they want: more churches, more followers, a prince or king propped up by themselves, from which they can cement the propaganda of divine right. A stable country is more conducive for them to expand their followers and grow their influence. Otherwise, in the constant chaos of war, churches and monasteries also become targets of plunder by refugees and nobles."



"But isn't it because they see that you can bring a stable life to the people?"



"Not exactly," Roland shook his head. "Stability comes from unity or balance. Even if the monarch indulges in pleasures every day, the people of a unified nation live better than refugees in the midst of war. Therefore, it's not surprising that they support the Second Prince or the Third Princess, but it's very strange that they come to support me—especially when Grace is winning overwhelmingly."



If the Church fully supported Grace at this time, the capital and the eastern front probably wouldn't last half a year before being completely swallowed by her. By then, seventy percent of the Kingdom of Greycastle's land would fall into the hands of Queen Clearwater, Roland thought, and the pressure he faced would greatly increase. Not helping the strong, but instead choosing to support himself, who seemed the weakest, made the Church's decision appear to be in his favor. But if he accepted their support, the struggle between the two kings of Greycastle would become even more chaotic, leading to a situation akin to an otherworldly version of the Three Kingdoms. The direct consequence would be a sharp decline in population, rapid loss of wealth, and the spread of war throughout the nation, prolonging the unification process.



What good would that do for the Church? Not to mention expanding their flock; the churches they built everywhere would probably be dismantled to the ground.



"I don't understand you nobles and your convoluted thinking," Nightingale sighed.



"Mhm," Roland replied with a smile, "except for me."



"..." The witch squinted her eyes and stared at the prince for a long time, "Strange, why is that statement also true?"



Three days later, Roland finally emptied the castle and fortress library, contentedly boarding the 'Seagull' on his way back home.



As they approached Border Town along the Redwater River, the scenery on both banks had changed. On the opposite side of the town, many people were busy on the clearing burnt out by Anna—they should be the serfs who had been sent to the town earlier. On this side, closer to the Impassable Mountain Range, many simple wooden sheds had been erected, with people faintly visible inside, Roland guessed that these were the serfs' families.



These people were bound to the land generation after generation, and the children born to them were also serfs. Lacking any hope, most of them lived numb lives. What drove them to labor was not an inner desire but the whips and nooses in the hands of their masters. The low productivity was a tremendous waste of human resources.



Undoubtedly, slavery was the enemy of industrial production, a system that had to be abolished. However, Roland had no intention of simply waving his hand and making them all free citizens instantly. Instead, he provided a pathway for them to see the hope of becoming free citizens—after all, there were precedents where masters released their slaves out of kindness. This compromise, even if it became known, would not have too much impact. At most, it would make other nobles think he was simply too soft-hearted.



When the time was right in the future, he would then implement the abolition of slavery more broadly, and the resistance to it would be much less.



The dock area was crowded with sailboats, clearly indicating that the small dock could no longer bear such heavy transportation pressure. Fortunately, the waters of Border Town were shallow enough to allow ships to dock without a pier. It seemed that expanding the dock needed to be scheduled, Roland thought.



After the party returned to the castle, he did not rest but immediately called for Barov in his office to report on the reception of supplies.



The minister's assistant was well-prepared, pulling out a roll of parchment from his pocket and spreading it on the large wooden table.



"Your Highness, the things you've brought back to the castle these days have really scared me," he said. Despite his words, the wrinkles on his face betrayed his true feelings, "Twelve apprentices worked all night to count the various coins, totaling over fourteen thousand Gold Royals! Your Highness, that's equivalent to the annual income of an ordinary town!"



It probably took the Duke more than twenty years to accumulate these Gold Royals, Roland thought, obtained through the exploitation and plunder of the people in the Western Territory. Now, he needed to quickly turn them into food, steel, and machinery. "What about the gemstones, jewelry, and crafts?"



"I haven't had time to calculate the exact amount, but a conservative estimate would put it at around ten thousand gold royals. If we were to send them to the capital to be auctioned, the price would be even higher. Right now, they are all stored in the basement of your castle," Barov paused for a moment, "However, this means that the rooms originally used for storing food are no longer sufficient. I suggest you expand the castle area and build additional warehouses to store other supplies."
