## Autumn Water
Once everyone had gathered, Roland recounted what Lightning had discovered from the beginning, "A transparent crystal coffin in an ancient ruin, showing no signs of decay in the humid basement, a magical gem constantly emitting distress signals, and the devil turned to ash... What do you think?"

"Do you mean to say that she might be a witch?" Anna pondered, "If she is still alive, we might be able to learn more about what happened over four hundred years ago."

"She might not be a witch, and she might not even be from that era," Scroll hesitated for a moment, "And…"

"And she might not necessarily be on our side," Leaf added.

This comment made Roland pause slightly. Indeed, if the ruin was left by the church, the other party might be a member of the church and, judging from the lavish clothes described by Lightning, possibly even a high-ranking one. It wouldn't be too difficult if it was an ordinary person, but if it turned out to be a witch, things would become complicated.

From the ashes and the skirmish with Nightingale, to the faceless attack, it was evident that there was no clear line dividing the combat strength among witches. Extraordinaries without the Divine Stone of Judgement could be overpowered by ordinary witches with unique abilities, and combat witches could be in a precarious situation if caught off guard by a support witch.

If the other party harbored ill intentions, no one could guarantee that her abilities wouldn't pose a threat to the Witch Union... unless she was awakened within the influence range of the Divine Stone of Judgement.

"Have you all gone mad, even considering whether she's on our side or not?" Lily weakly supported her forehead, "How could someone from over four hundred years ago be alive today? Witches are short-lived to begin with, and even among the extraordinaries with enhanced bodies, none have lived past a hundred years. You're all thinking too much. In my opinion, maybe once that thing breaks, the person inside will turn to dust just like the devil."

"Short lives are due to the so-called demonic bite," Roland corrected, "Witches generally have a stronger constitution than ordinary people; their actual lifespan should be longer."



"Ordinary people only live for fifty, maybe sixty years," Lily snorted. "Do you think everyone lives as long as a tortoise?" 

The average lifespan of fifty to sixty years was due to poor food supply and low medical standards. If the quality of life improved, it could increase by another twenty years. However, she wasn't entirely wrong, Roland thought. Even with these improvements, there was still a significant gap from a lifespan of four hundred years... Even tortoises probably couldn't live that long.



"But she does seem to be alive," Lightning insisted. "You'll see if you look, she's completely different from those dead devils, her skin is smooth and radiant, her lips full of color. Maggie!"



"Goo! Lightning is right!"



"Alright, stop arguing," Wendy intervened, "Regardless of whether she's dead or alive, she's worth our attempt to rescue."



"Are you sure?" Scroll frowned.



"If she really is a witch from the Church, we'll just have to hang the Divine Stone of Judgement around her neck before she wakes up. Plus, we have Anna and Nightingale, so restraining her won't be a problem," Wendy said calmly. "The key point is, she might know about the catastrophe that happened over four hundred years ago. Just for that alone, it's worth it for us to go and rescue her."



Indeed, information about the demons was very important to the town, and any news that the Church was desperately trying to hide would definitely be detrimental to them. If they could get a hold of this information in advance, they might gain the upper hand in future confrontations.



Anna and Nightingale also agreed with Wendy's view, and with that, even if Scroll felt uneasy, she no longer objected. The Witch Union had essentially reached a consensus.



"Where is the First Army?" Roland looked towards Iron Axe.



"We can only deploy fifty men at most," the latter spoke, "Your Highness, you have already dispatched several squads to assist the City Hall in recruiting refugees from various places. Now, there are only a little over five hundred soldiers left in the town. Although Timothy has suffered divine punishment, he might still make a desperate attempt to launch a large-scale attack on the Western Territory. The First Army must retain enough manpower to defend against an assault on the capital."



"I understand," he nodded. Fifty men was indeed a small number, and they were likely to suffer heavy casualties when facing the devils' long-range spear attacks from beyond their line of sight. To compensate for this, besides Lightning and Maggie's aerial reconnaissance, Sylvie's clairvoyance was indispensable. The ideal team should be a hot air balloon advancing in coordination with ground troops, with the witches undertaking alert and close combat duties, and long-range suppression handled by the gun squad.



However, by doing so, the witches of Sleeping Island would also learn about the existence of the sleepers in the ruins. After much consideration, Roland still decided to bring Sylvie along; after all, ensuring his own safety was still the most important matter for this rescue mission.



Just as he was about to arrange the rescue plan, Miya exclaimed in a low voice, "Oh my god... What is that?"



Everyone followed her gaze towards the window, only to be stunned.



Roland couldn't believe it as he pushed open the window, to see that the gloomy sky was somehow filled with white elves, covering the sky yet completely silent. He reached out his hand to catch a few white dots, feeling the chill in his palm.



It was snowing.



This was not normal... As far as he knew, winter in the Western Territory only brought one snowfall, and it wasn't even winter yet!



Does it also snow in the second month of autumn? He looked towards Iron Axe, whose face was serious as he slowly said, "I've only been in the town for seven or eight years and have never experienced such a situation."

Once heavy snow falls, it signifies the arrival of the Evil Months, with the sun buried beneath the clouds until it shines brightly again. During this time, the entire Western Region faces the threat of demonic beasts. Not to mention deploying the First Army, even transporting witches by hot air balloon becomes dangerous—during this period, the Misty Forest is filled with vicious demonic beasts, and leaving the protection of the city walls is an extremely risky venture.

He had no choice but to suspend the rescue plan and wait for clear skies.

Deep down, he felt that the heavy snow was likely an anomaly that would soon end. After all, the temperature was still at autumn levels and had not dropped much.

Three days later, the town was draped in silver, with distant mountains and forests all cloaked in a layer of white gauze. In later times, it would undoubtedly be considered a rare and beautiful sight, but Roland had no mood to appreciate the scenery.

Although the snow had weakened considerably, there were still sporadic snowflakes falling. The First Army had entered a state of full alert, with regular patrols on the newly built city walls every day, and temporary camps set up at the base of the walls for soldiers to quickly join the battle. The temperature was changing almost daily, and he had switched from light clothing to a cotton-wool coat.

On the fourth day, news from the front line made Roland's heart sink completely.

The western section of the city wall had been attacked by demonic beasts.

The Evil Months had come more than a month early.
