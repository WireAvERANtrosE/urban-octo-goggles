## Town wall
The production of cement was quickly put on the right track. In order to allow Anna to get ample rest, the kiln was only fired once every two or three days. When not firing, they prepared as many raw materials as possible. For this purpose, Roland issued another recruitment order, doubling the number of stone-breaking workers.



However, he was also clear that he could not always rely on Anna for these tasks. Long-term work in a dusty environment could lead to silicosis, and with the future expansion of production, Anna alone cannot meet the demand.



Witches should not be used as consumables but should serve as engines driving the advancement of civilization. Although Roland was very clear about this in his heart, he could only focus all his energy on the construction of the town walls for now. If they could not stop the demonic beasts, there would be nothing else to talk about.



The foundation for the wall connecting Northern Slope Mountain and the Redwater River had already begun excavation. Following the practice from before he crossed over, he, as the project's chief officer, personally dug the first shovel of soil in front of a crowd of onlookers with astonished expressions.



He had thought that after solving the cement problem, building a wall would be a breeze, but he soon realized that he had no understanding of civil engineering. How deep should the foundation be dug, and how wide? How to deal with uneven terrain? How to ensure that the more than six hundred meters long wall would be straight once built? He had seen municipal road construction workers using instruments and sighting rods, which seemed to be called theodolites and levels, right? But he had none of that here!



As a mechanical drafting dog, Roland, although dubbed one of the "twin dogs of engineering" along with the civil construction workers next door, studied content that was worlds apart. The masons hired had not participated in any large-scale construction, so they were even less knowledgeable than himself. Therefore, the construction of the wall progressed extremely slowly, only half a shallow trench was dug out after a week.



Once a project lost control, it was hard to say what the final product would look like. For example, this shallow trench that was finally excavated, rather than being called the foundation of a wall, it would be more apt to call it a drainage ditch. Although Roland had gestured a rough width at the start of the excavation, the width visibly deformed as they dug, becoming narrower and narrower. Viewed from a distance, it looked like a winding, twisting little snake.



Even so, Roland was unwilling to stop the work. With the spirit of digging as much as possible, as long as the kiln was not firing, he would spend the whole day at the foot of Northern Slope Mountain, adjusting the direction of the foundation pit with his naked eye, slowly pushing forward. He also doubled the pay offered to the stonemasons in the recruitment order.



Fortunately, this embarrassment did not last too long. While Roland was directing the preparation for the sixth batch of cement in the kiln, Barov reported that a stonemason had responded to the recruitment and claimed to have spent time in the Stonemason's Guild of Greycastle. The person was already brought to the courtyard, waiting for an audience.



He recalled a little and was overjoyed. The guild was a renowned organization in his memory, even the Fourth Prince had heard of their name. Although it seemed that they had been ordered to disband due to a construction accident, which line of work didn't have accidents?



"Bring him in," Roland said with a calm and composed expression, nodding his head. He had wanted to ask Anna to avoid the meeting, but then he thought better of it. Border Town had more than two thousand people, and not many had seen the true face of a witch. Besides, Anna's current appearance was completely different from when she was seeking death; dressed in strange attire, he estimated even those who had seen her wouldn't recognize her.



Karl Barton was brought into the courtyard by the knight, feeling restless. He planned to first tell His Highness that this season was not suitable for large-scale projects, and after gaining His Highness's trust, he would slowly change his views on witches. But the rumors said His Highness acted without restraint, what if his persuasion backfired?



He bowed in a fluster, but when he raised his head, he froze—the girl beside His Highness looked so familiar, it made him feel like he was dreaming. Karl rubbed his eyes and looked again, unable to help but exclaim, "...Anna!"



Damn, thought Roland, this is bad, what a coincidence. To call for a craftsman and end up summoning Anna's neighbor? It was clear that the man was extremely familiar with Anna; otherwise, he wouldn't have recognized her in an instant. He turned his head towards Carter Lannis, and the Chief Knight, understanding the situation, immediately pulled the bolt on the door, blocking the only exit.



"Teacher?"



Anna's reaction left Roland momentarily stunned. What, teacher?



"It really is you, Anna, I... I..." Karl felt a warmth in his eyes, followed by something trickling down. He fell to his knees, weakly repeating, "I'm sorry, I'm sorry... it's so good, so... good..."



It took a while for Karl Barton to calm down. He slowly rose to his feet and bowed again to Roland, "I apologize for my behavior, Your Highness. I lost my composure."



"What exactly is going on here? Aren't you a stonemason?"

"I was," Karl replied smoothly, now that the weight had been lifted from his heart. His Highness had not killed Anna, the one executed on the scaffold was a substitute—realizing this, he knew what he had to do. Although he was unclear why the other party would save a witch, in any case, even if His Highness wanted to bring her into his harem, it was much better than being sent to the gallows. This at least showed that Prince Roland was not afraid of the rumors that witches were the devil incarnate.



He detailed his experience of being displaced from King's City to Border Town, including setting up an academy here and the discovery that his student Nana Pine had also become a witch. In the end, he pleaded with His Highness to also hide Nana in the palace to prevent her from being persecuted once exposed.



Anna, standing by the side, although she had the look of wanting to plead for Nana, did not utter a word.



Another new witch, this was indeed great news, but the surname Pine seemed familiar. Roland summoned Barov to ask quietly and learned that it was the surname of a minor noble family in Border Town.



"You can bring her to see me, and if she truly is a witch, I guarantee she will not be harmed," Roland promised, "But I cannot take her away from the Pine family, especially before she faces any actual threats from her family members. Also, saving Anna is not what you think..." He thought for a moment and decided it was better to clarify, "I need her help. Rather than believing in the absurd talk of demonic powers, I believe that a witch's power is neutral, neither good nor evil, and can be controlled. So whether it's Anna or Nana, any witch who has not committed an unlawful act, I will not consider them guilty."



"Now, let's talk about official business, have you been involved in the construction of Greycastle's walls?" The prince shifted the conversation back to the matter of construction.



"Yes!" Karl nodded, although the Fourth Prince Roland did not take Nana in as he had hoped, and the mention of needing a witch's help was baffling, in the end, he was willing to ensure Nana's safety, and that was enough.



"Good, I plan to build a wall at the foot of the northern slope and along the Redwater River to fend off the demonic beasts' invasion. You will be in charge of this project from now on."
