## City Wall
The production of cement quickly got on the right track, and to ensure Anna had ample rest, the kiln was only fired once every two or three days. When not firing, they prepared as many raw materials as possible. For this purpose, Roland once again issued a recruitment order, doubling the number of stone breakers.

However, he was also aware that he could not always rely on Anna for these tasks. Long-term work in a dusty environment could lead to silicosis, and with the future expansion of production, one Anna would not be enough to meet the demand.

Witches should not be used as consumables, but rather as engines driving the advancement of civilization. Although Roland was well aware of this, he still had to focus all his energy on the construction of the city walls. Without stopping the demonic beasts, there was nothing else to discuss.

The foundation of the wall connecting the North Slope Mountain and the Redwater River had already begun excavation. Following the customs from before his transmigration, as the project leader, he personally dug the first shovel of soil in front of a crowd of onlookers with astonished expressions.

He had thought that after solving the cement problem, building a city wall would be a breeze. However, in practice, he discovered that he knew nothing about construction. How deep and wide should the foundation be? How to deal with uneven terrain? How to ensure that the wall would be straight over a length of more than six hundred meters? He had seen a group of young men using instruments and levels while repairing roads, which seemed to be called theodolites and levels, right? But nothing like that existed here!

As a mechanical drafting dog, although Roland was known along with the civil engineering brick-moving dog as the twin dogs of engineering, what he had learned was vastly different. The mason craftsmen he hired had not participated in any large-scale construction, and were even less knowledgeable than himself. Thus, the progress of the city wall was extremely slow, with only a shallow trench dug out after a week.

Once a project loses control, it's hard to say what the final product will look like. For instance, this trench that was finally dug out, it was less a foundation for a city wall and more of a drainage ditch. Although Roland had gestured a rough width when they started digging, the width had obviously deformed as they progressed, becoming narrower and narrower. Viewed from a distance, it looked like a twisted little snake.

Even so, Roland was unwilling to halt construction. With the spirit of digging as much as possible, as long as the kiln was not operating, he would stay at the foot of the North Slope Mountain all day, using his naked eye to adjust the extension direction of the foundation pit, slowly pushing forward. At the same time, he doubled the wages for the stonemasons on the recruitment notice.

Fortunately, this embarrassment did not last too long. While Roland was directing the preparation for the sixth batch of cement firing in the kiln, his ministerial assistant Barov reported that a stonemason had responded to the recruitment. He claimed to have worked at the Greycastle Stonemason Association and was already waiting outside for an audience.

After a brief recollection, Roland was overjoyed. The Greycastle Stonemason Association was a well-known organization in his memory, even the Fourth Prince had heard of their name. Although it seemed they were ordered to disband due to a construction accident, which line of work doesn't have accidents?

"Bring him in," Roland said with a calm and composed expression, nodding his head. He originally wanted to ask Anna to leave, but then he thought better of it. Border Town had more than two thousand people, and not many had seen a witch's true face. Besides, Anna's appearance had changed so much from the time she was desperate to die that even if someone had seen her before, they probably wouldn't recognize her in her unique attire.

Karl · Barton was led into the yard by the knight, feeling uneasy. He planned to first tell His Highness that this season was not suitable for launching large-scale projects, and after gaining His Highness's trust, he would gradually change his views on witches. But the rumors said that His Highness was unscrupulous in his actions, what if his attempt to dissuade backfired?

He bowed nervously and when he raised his head, he was stunned—the girl standing beside His Highness looked so familiar that he thought he was dreaming. Karl rubbed his eyes and looked again, unable to help but cry out, "…Anna!"

Damn it, Roland thought, this is bad, what are the odds that a randomly recruited craftsman would turn out to be the witch's neighbor? It was clear that the other party was more than familiar with Anna; otherwise, he wouldn't have recognized her in the blink of an eye. He turned his head to look at Carter · Lannis, the Chief Knight who understood immediately, pulled the door bolt shut, and blocked the only exit.

"Tea...cher?"

Anna's reaction left Roland momentarily dumbfounded. What, a teacher?

"It really is you, Anna, I... I..." Karl felt a warmth in his eyes, followed by something trickling down. He fell to his knees, weakly repeating, "I'm sorry, I'm sorry... It's good, so... good..."
It took Karl Barton quite a while to regain his composure. He slowly stood up and bowed again to Roland, "I apologize for my conduct, Your Highness."
"What is going on? Aren't you a stonemason?"
"I was." Karl spoke more fluently after unburdening his heart. His Highness had not killed Anna, and the one hanged at the execution ground was a substitute—realizing this, he knew what he had to do. Although he was unclear why the other party wanted to save a witch, regardless of the reason, even if His Highness desired to take her into his harem, it was far better than sending her to the gallows. This at least showed that Prince Roland was not afraid of the rumors that witches were the devil's incarnations.

He detailed his journey from Greycastle to Border Town, including establishing a school here and discovering that his student, Nana Pine, had also become a witch. In the end, he pleaded with His Highness to also hide Nana within the palace to prevent persecution should her identity be exposed.

Anna, standing aside, had a face full of desire to plead for Nana, but she never spoke a word.

Another new witch, this was indeed significant news, but the surname Pine seemed familiar. Roland summoned a ministerial assistant to ask in a whisper and learned that it was the surname of a minor noble family in Border Town.

"You may bring her to see me, and if she truly is a witch, I promise she will not be harmed," Roland promised, "But I cannot take her away from the Pine family, especially if she has not faced any actual threats from her family members. Furthermore, my saving Anna is not what you think..." He pondered for a moment and decided it was better to clarify, "I need her help. Rather than believing in nonsensical talk about demonic powers, I believe that a witch's power is neutral and controllable. So whether it's Anna or Nana, any witch who has not committed any crimes, I will not consider them guilty."

"Now, let's talk about business, were you involved in the construction of Greycastle's city walls?" The prince brought the topic back to construction matters.

"Yes!" Karl nodded, although the Fourth Prince did not take Nana in as he had hoped, and the idea of needing a witch's help was baffling, it was enough that he was willing to ensure Nana's safety.

"Good, I plan to build a wall at the Redwater River and the foot of the Northern Slope Mountain to fend off the demonic beasts. You will be in charge of this project from now on."
