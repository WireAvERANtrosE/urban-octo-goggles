## Transportation Corridor
"Your Highness, do you know who sent these people?" Carter asked, moving closer after Wetter left.

"Those with pills, apart from the Church, are Timothy. Grace has now moved far away from Greycastle, and it's unlikely she still has me in mind," Roland sighed. "Compared to the former, Timothy is more likely. He now dares not easily dispatch a large army away from the capital, but that doesn't mean he won't seek revenge against me."

Fortunately, the attackers who blended into the crowd only carried pills and were not decked out with gunpowder. Otherwise, if they had detonated in the crowd, the efforts of the past two months would have been in vain.

Roland was not worried that the "suicide squad" he dispatched would pose a threat to himself. On days when Nightingale was not around, he went everywhere with more than a dozen personal guards, and he also wore the Divine Stone of Judgement. Let alone drug-crazed berserkers, even extraordinary witches would find it difficult to get close to him under the suppression of ten revolving rifles.

He found that in less than a year since taking the lordship, his mentality had already undergone a great change. If it had been when he first arrived, facing such a situation might have made his legs go weak and left him at a loss. But just now, although he felt somewhat nervous, he still managed to maintain a calm and composed appearance on the surface—he knew the guards would definitely stand in front of him, blocking the enemy without regard for their own lives. As the focus of public attention, he could not show the slightest panic, a thought that even surprised himself.

"Call over the people from the delegation and ask them in detail about their recruitment process," Roland said, turning to Barov, "I need to know where these few people boarded the ship."

"Yes, Your Highness," the Chief Officer of the City Hall replied, his face somewhat somber, probably because he had not expected that his proud subordinates would commit such a grave mistake, leaving him feeling rather disgraced.

"Don't be too harsh on them, find out the situation first."

After all the refugees had passed through the checkpoint, Roland returned to his office in the castle. The news brought back by the delegation this time was particularly surprising—there were a large number of displaced people in the southern regions, with Eagle City and Clearwater Port destroyed by war and many fields outside the cities lying fallow. Coupled with this year's strange weather, the temperature in various parts of Greycastle had plummeted, causing food prices to soar and even slave prices to drop by half.



As long as he could establish a reliable transportation channel, he could continuously bring in these populations to the Western Region—in fact, according to the report from the envoy group, upon hearing the pioneering recruitment order of Border Town, many refugees had already begun to spontaneously move towards the Western Region.

However, the difficulty lay in the "transportation channel."

The heavy snow of the Evil Months had covered all the land routes, making it impossible to bring people in except by way of the Redwater River. And Border Town had only one boat, the Town, which could not move without a witch, far from meeting the demand—if there were to be boats sailing on the route at all times, at least about twenty inland sailboats would need to be invested in.

For example, the envoy group sent out this time had fallen into such a predicament: the Gold royals they carried were only partly used to attract refugees, with the majority spent on hiring boats and settling people. So far, only four hundred people had arrived in Border Town, with more than three thousand still stranded in Willow Town, Silver City, and Dragon Ridge, waiting for transport by boat.

Moreover, all the boat owners were well aware of the current situation in the Western Region and had raised their prices significantly. Just for these three thousand people, the estimated cost was already on par with the last grand rescue mission in the capital. Continuing like this was not a long-term solution. Roland thought for a while and decided to send a letter of assistance to the Margrave Commerce Guild, hoping that they would not quote a price several times higher, in consideration of Lightning.

But to completely cut this expenditure, he would have to build his own boats—now that the quality of steel and cement had greatly improved, it was entirely possible to construct sturdier and larger flat-bottomed riverboats, using steam engines as power to build this Redwater River transportation line.

...

After lunch, Barov knocked on the door and came in, "Your Highness, I have roughly inquired about the situation."

"Go ahead."



"A disciple named Siren was responsible for going to the Northern Region to attract refugees. On the way back, due to a lack of ships, he contacted some friends he had made in the capital, hoping they could help inquire about or hire some merchant ships willing to head to the Western Region." Barov sighed, "The news must have leaked from here... He settled the refugees in Silver City, only half a day's journey from the capital. It wouldn't be hard for Timothy to make a move."



"How many people are still stranded in Silver City?"



"About eight hundred," Barov said in a low voice, "It takes half a month for the merchant ships to make a round trip, and who knows what will happen when the next batch of refugees arrives. Perhaps... we should immediately recall the First Army squad and abandon these people."



"No, no, we'll just weed out anyone Timothy has planted one by one. When the time comes, we just need to make sure we have good checkpoints and have them go through separately," Roland shook his head, "If we abandon the refugees in Silver City and someone makes it back to the Northern Region to spread their experience, then we can forget about attracting people from there ever again."



With Sylvie's observational perspective and Nightingale's Truth Inquiry, no spy or assassin could hide, so he wasn't worried about that. He just needed to prevent them from harming the other refugees.



"Yes, Your Highness," Barov coughed twice before asking, "Then... as for Siren's handling, what do you think..."



"What do you think?"



He hesitated for a moment, "The incident occurred because he was too careless. I suggest removing him from his position at the City Hall and fining him two months' salary. Siren's mistake was not deliberate, nor did it cause significant harm. It's not appropriate to relegate him to the North Slope Mine."



Roland couldn't help but laugh, seeing the other's pained expression written all over his face, "Rest assured, I've already made a decision. Considering he made this mistake due to a lack of experience rather than a subjective dereliction of duty, a lighter punishment is in order. After all, it was his first time in such a position... I remember he's only in his twenties, right? Given this, after such a lesson, he should be able to grow quickly. Just a fine of two months' salary will do."



"Yes, sir," Barov immediately bowed and said, "I will do as you say."

The prince shook his head with a smile. Although he had been incredibly stern at the beginning, when it came time to actually punish, he showed clear reluctance—after all, Seren had been by his side since the days in the capital, and was among the first disciples to arrive at Border Town. In Barov's eyes, Seren was almost like a child he had raised himself.

"You may leave now."

After dealing with the matter, Roland stretched himself. He took out several blank sheets of paper from the drawer, intending to draw a draft of the steam concrete ship, when Nightingale suddenly rushed in.

"Your Highness," she said excitedly, "the Seagull has returned!"

"Really?" Roland sprang to his feet and followed her quickly to the back garden. They saw the huge hot air balloon slowly descending, its shadow dimming the light in the yard.

As soon as the basket touched the ground, Anna jumped out. Roland opened his arms to greet her, and she embraced him gently with a smile.

"I'm back."
