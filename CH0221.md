## Rescue Plan
Having made this decision, the first problem he faced was: should he personally go to the King's City?

This was the First Army of Border Town's first time engaging in combat far from the Western Region, unlike the two defensive battles, they would inevitably face the trouble of unfamiliar terrain. Without a preset battlefield, it was unknown how much of their combat power they could exert; he found it hard to be at ease without going himself—although Roland's military level was extremely limited, his understanding of firearms could be considered top-notch for the era.



However, once he left Border Town, the Western Region would become uncontrolled territory. If the news reached Longsong Stronghold, it was uncertain what schemes the big families might concoct. As long as someone leaked this information to Timothy, both the frontline and the rear would suffer—Timothy might not care much about a few witches, but if he knew that he was near the King's City, it would be strange if he didn't muster a large army to encircle and suppress them. To take ten thousand steps back, even if he spared himself, if he commanded his subordinates to strike the Western Region from the north, he would still be at a dead end.



All in all, a fire in the rear was always much more serious than a defeat at the frontline.



In the end, Roland decided to stay in Border Town.



After all, the main task of the First Army was to protect the witches, and then to guide the refugees onto the ships in batches, not to engage in direct combat with Timothy's King's City Patrol or the Church's Judgement Army. As long as the rescue measures were properly executed, and nothing unexpected happened, it was very likely they would not need to fire a single shot.



Of course, he had to come up with a rescue plan that was as perfect as possible.



At noon that day, Roland called over Carter, Iron Axe, Barov, and the members of the Witch Union.



The topography near the King's City was only a vague memory from his childhood as the fourth prince, but this was not a major issue. He asked Soraya to draw a simple map on the dining table in the parlor and began to give orders to Iron Axe and Barov.



"This central square represents the capital, and this blue line represents the canal," Roland said thoughtfully. "You have two tasks: first is to protect the witches as they heal the refugees and bring them back to Border Town; the second is to prevent the demonic plague from continuing to spread within the king's city. Let me reveal something to you first, it's very likely that the church is behind this epidemic."



"Wha... What?" Iron Axe stared incredulously, Carter frowned, but Iron Axe's expression remained unchanged—as a Mojin clan Sand People who worship the Three Gods of Nature, he held no reverence for the Church or its proclaimed only true god. This pleased Roland greatly.



"After the Church annexed the Kingdom of Everwinter, they launched an attack on Wolfheart. If Wolfheart falls, I believe it's only a matter of time before Dawn and Greycastle become their next targets. In fact, the Royal Decree itself is dubious." The prince briefly explained how the Church had provided the pills to Timothy, Garcia, and himself, "Just from this, it's clear that they're not supporting any heir, but encouraging us to slaughter each other. The nobles who took the pill wouldn't become battle-hardened soldiers; instead, they would die of weakness once they stopped taking it. The same is with this epidemic, the demonic plague had just begun to spread in the capital, and the Church claimed to have the antidote, yet ironically, they have been delaying distributing it to the citizens."



"Only the light that shines into hell is the most dazzling," Iron Axe spoke.



"Exactly, to play the role of a savior, one must act at the moment when people are most suffering. The greater the contrast, the deeper the impression the Church makes. As for the innocents who die along the way, they are merely sacrifices for not being devout enough," Roland stated, "So, in addition to rescuing the refugees from the Eastern Region, we also need to disrupt the Church's plot as much as possible."



"What should we do?" Iron Axe asked after taking a deep breath.



"Keep yourselves as covert as possible and complete the mission without them noticing," Roland pointed to a large open area south of the docks outside the canal, "This should all be farmland, very suitable for lying low. You should find high ground there to establish a lookout that can oversee the docks. The soldiers responsible for the rendezvous should disguise themselves as mercenaries for a merchant caravan and escort the healed refugees onto the ships. I will contact the merchant Margie to gather as many sailboats as possible, rather than just two fleets for transport."



Whether it's Longsong Stronghold or the capital of Greycastle, the patrol forces of big cities seldom cover the surrounding areas. Their surveillance range is basically determined by the height of the city walls—how far they can see from the walls is how far the alert area extends. And this area south of the docks has already left their surveillance range, so setting up troops here is unlikely to attract the attention of the capital's guards.



"How are we supposed to treat those patients?" Iron Axe inquired.



"Mainly relying on the duplicates created by Lily," Roland briefly explained the little girl's unique ability, "She doesn't need to enter the refugee camps to cure these people; any microbe can become a duplicate—in other words, you just need to continuously collect river water for her to purify, and then give it to the sick to drink."



"Just... like that?" He was stunned.



"There are two things to note," the prince held up two fingers, "First, ensure that every person who boards the ship has drunk the purified water, and second, absolutely do not use boiled drinking water to create purified water—in fact, the dirtier the purified water, the better. The more microbes, the more duplicates are created. You may not understand, but just do as I say."



"What about the patients in the King's City? Do we do the same for them?"



"Almost, but it can't be our people delivering the medicine; that would be too conspicuous. Let Theo take care of that part," Roland said, "As long as the payment is in place, the efficiency of the Black Street Rats is quite high."



"Your Highness, rats are not reliable; as long as there is profit to be made, they could stab their employer in the back at any time," Carter objected.



"That's why the second task is to prevent, not necessarily to complete," the prince stood up, "As long as something seems amiss, the First Army should immediately protect the witches and retreat. Successfully bringing back the refugees is a victory, and saving as many citizens of the King's City as we can is a bonus. Moreover, thwarting the Church's plan is not solely dependent on the evolution water. As long as the truth isn't as they claim—that 'only the Holy Medicine can fight against the demonic plague'—their charade has already failed."



"Finally, I announce the selection of people heading to the King's City," he said loudly, "Iron Axe!"



"Yes!"



"You will lead two hundred and forty gunners to protect the witches, control the canal docks, and eliminate potential threats. You must bring back the witches and the people from the Eastern Region safely."

"Understood, Your Highness!" Iron Axe stood at attention and saluted.

"Brian!"

"Yes!" The young knight stood tall and proud.

"You will lead sixty soldiers disguised as a merchant caravan's mercenaries, responsible for delivering medicine, guiding refugees, and maintaining order during boarding."

"I will heed your orders, Your Highness!"

"Next are the witches, those accompanying the ship to the King's City this time are Lily, Nightingale, Echo, Lightning, and Wendy." Roland's voice slowed down, "I will explain your tasks in detail later, but what's important is to take care of yourselves and return safely."

"Don't worry, Your Highness," Nightingale patted her chest, "I'm here."

Roland nodded, "Then the last point, which is also the most important one — after the troops arrive at the King's City, they can stay there for at most three days. Once the three days are up, regardless of the actual situation, you must return to Border Town." He spoke word by word, "If the church plans to destroy Greycastle's resistance, they will definitely not only create an epidemic in the King's City. The Western Region is also likely one of their targets. Therefore, you cannot stay in the King's City for more than three days. Do you understand?"



"Yes, Your Highness!" Iron Axe and Brian said in unison.

"Very well, then carry out the plan as such."

"Wait... Your Highness, what about me?" Carter raised his hand.

"You will lead the remaining soldiers of the First Army and guard my Border Town," Roland patted his shoulder.
