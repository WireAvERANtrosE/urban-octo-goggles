## Rescue Plan
Since he had made this decision, the first problem he faced was: Should he go to the royal capital himself?

This was the First Army of Border Town's first operation away from the Western Territory. Unlike the two defensive battles, they would inevitably encounter the troubles of unfamiliar terrain. Without a predetermined battlefield, it was unknown how much of their combat power they could exert; he really couldn’t rest easy without going—although Roland’s military level was extremely limited, his understanding of firearms could be considered top-notch for the era.



However, once he left Border Town, the Western Territory would become a land without control. If the news reached Longsong Stronghold, there was no guarantee that the several big families wouldn't get any crooked ideas. As long as someone leaked this information to Timothy, disaster would follow—both at the front and rear. Timothy might not care much about a few witches, but if he learned that Roland was near the royal capital, it would be strange if he didn't mobilize a large army to encircle and suppress them. To take ten thousand steps back, even if Timothy spared him, ordering his subordinates to strike the Western Territory from the north would leave Roland equally trapped.



All things considered, a fire in the backyard was always far more serious than a defeat at the front.



In the end, Roland decided to stay in Border Town.



After all, the main mission of the First Army was to protect the witches, followed by guiding the refugees to board the ships in batches, rather than engaging in frontal combat with Timothy's royal patrol or the Church's Judgement Army. As long as the rescue measures were executed properly and nothing unexpected happened, they might not even have to fire a single shot.



Of course, he had to devise a rescue plan that was as perfect as possible.



By noon that day, Roland had called over Carter, Iron Axe, Brian, and the members of the Witch Union.



The geography near the royal capital was only a vague impression in the memories of his childhood as the fourth prince, but that was not a big problem. He asked Soraya to draw a simple map on the dining table in the reception hall and began to give orders to Iron Axe and Brian.



"This central square represents the king's city, and this blue line represents the canal," Roland said thoughtfully. "You have two tasks. The first is to protect the witches as they heal the refugees and bring them back to Border Town. The second is to stop the demonic plague from spreading further within the king's city. Let me reveal something to you first: the epidemic was most likely caused by the Church."



"What... What?" Brian widened his eyes in disbelief, while Carter frowned. Only Iron Axe's expression remained unchanged—as a Mojin clan Sand People who worshipped the Three Gods of nature, he held no reverence for the Church or its so-called one true God, which pleased Roland greatly.



"After the Church annexed the Kingdom of Everwinter, they launched an attack on the Wolfheart. If Wolfheart falls, I think it's only a matter of time before Dawn and Greycastle become their next targets. In fact, the Royal Decree itself is suspect," the prince briefly explained the matter of the Church providing pills to Timothy, Grace, and himself. "From this alone, it is clear that they are not supporting any one heir, but encouraging us to fight each other. The nobles who take the pills will not become battle-hardened soldiers but will die, weakened and debilitated, once the supply is cut off. The same is true for this plague. Just as the demonic plague began to spread in the king's city, the Church declared they had the antidote, yet ironically, they have been slow to distribute it to the townspeople."



"Only the light that shines into hell is the most dazzling," Iron Axe spoke.



"Exactly. To play the role of a savior, one must act at the moment when the people are most suffering. The stronger the contrast, the deeper the impression left by the Church. As for those innocents who die along the way, they are nothing but sacrifices due to their lack of devout faith," Roland stated. "So, in addition to rescuing the refugees from the Eastern Region, we must also try to foil the Church's conspiracy."



"What should we do?" Brian took a deep breath.



"Conceal yourselves as much as possible and complete the mission without the enemy noticing," Roland pointed to a large open space south of the docks outside the canal. "This should all be cropland, very suitable for lying low. You should find a high point here to establish an observation post that can overlook the docks. The soldiers responsible for the rendezvous will disguise themselves as mercenaries for a merchant caravan and escort the healed refugees onto the ship. I will contact the merchant Margaret to try to gather as many sailboats as possible, not just two fleets to participate in the transport."



Whether it's the Longsong Stronghold or the king's city of Greycastle, the patrol forces of big cities rarely cover the surrounding areas. The extent of their surveillance basically depends on the height of the city walls—how far one can see from atop the walls determines the range of the alert zone. And this area to the south of the docks has already left the enemy's surveillance range, so it would be difficult for the king's city guards to notice if the troops were stationed there.



"How should the patients be treated?" Iron Axe asked.



"The main reliance is on the replicants created by Lily," Roland briefly described the little girl's peculiar abilities, "She doesn't need to enter the refugee camps to heal these people, any microorganism can become a replicant—in other words, you just need to continuously collect river water for her to purify, and then give it to the patients to drink."



"Just... like that?" He was stunned.



"There are two points to note," the prince held up two fingers, "First, make sure everyone who gets on board drinks the purified water, and second, absolutely do not use boiled drinking water to make the purified water—in fact, the dirtier the purification water, the better. The more microorganisms there are, the more replicants will be produced. You might not understand, but just do as I say."



"What about the patients in the king's city, do we do the same?"



"It's similar, but we can't have our people deliver the medicine, that would be too conspicuous. Let Tassa handle that part," Roland said, "As long as the payment is right, the rats of the underworld can be quite efficient."



"Your Highness, rats are not reliable, they can stab their employer in the back at any time if there's a profit to be made," Carter objected.



"That's why the second task is to try to prevent it, not a must to complete," the prince stood up, "As long as anything goes wrong, the First Army should immediately protect the witches to retreat. It's a victory as long as we can safely bring back the refugees, and as for the city's citizens, we save as many as we can. Moreover, thwarting the Church's plan isn't just about the evolution water, as long as the truth isn't as they claim—that 'only the Holy Medicine can fight against the demonic plague,' their trickery has already failed."



"Finally, I announce the selection for this trip to the king's city," he declared loudly, "Iron Axe!"



"Present!"



"You will lead two hundred and forty gunners to protect the witches, control the canal docks, and eliminate potential threats. You must bring back both the witches and the people of the Eastern Region safely."

"At your command, Your Highness!" Iron Axe stood at attention and saluted.

"Bryan!"

"Yes!" The young knight stood tall and proud.

"You will lead sixty soldiers disguised as a merchant convoy's mercenaries, responsible for delivering medicine, guiding refugees, and maintaining order during boarding."

"I will heed your orders, Your Highness!"

"Next are the witches. Those accompanying the ship to the capital this time are Lily, Nightingale, Echo, Lightning, and Wendy." Roland's voice slowed down, "I will explain your tasks in detail later. The important thing is to protect yourselves and return safely."

"Don't worry, Your Highness," Nightingale patted her chest, "I'm here."

Roland nodded, "Then the last point, and the most important one—after the troops arrive at the capital, they can stay there for no more than three days. Once the three days are up, regardless of the actual situation, you must return to Border Town." He spoke slowly and deliberately, "If the Church plans to destroy Greycastle's resistance, they will certainly not limit their efforts to creating a plague in the capital; the Western Region is likely one of their targets as well. Therefore, you cannot stay in the capital for more than three days, understood?"



"Yes, Your Highness!" Iron Axe and Brian said in unison.

"Very well, then let's carry out the plan as discussed."

"Wait... Your Highness, what about me?" Carter raised his hand.

"You will lead the remaining soldiers of the First Army to guard my Border Town," Roland patted his shoulder.
