## Magic Stone
Agatha was taken aback. She had not expected that the other party would possess a flying magic stone, and moreover, had already figured out how to use it. After hesitating for a while, she finally spoke up, "We only understand the relationship between magic power and magic stones, but we cannot manufacture magic stones."

"Cannot manufacture?" Tilly asked in surprise, "What do you mean?"

"These magic stones... they are all made by devils..." she sighed, "If we could have a stable source of magic stones, we could transform witches into battle witches, and there would be no need for the God's Punishment Army project."

"Made by devils?" The witches couldn't help but show surprised expressions, only Roland's complexion grew dark.

"How much do you know about the manufacture of magic stones?" he asked, "And how are these stones created?"

His questioning tone was somewhat blunt. Agatha didn't want to answer, but considering that the devils were the ultimate enemy of the witches, this information would have to be shared sooner or later. After mentally grumbling about his rudeness, she slowly replied, "There is a peculiar individual within the devil race, which we call the Chaos Beast. It looks like a huge bud, standing about three to four people tall, with tentacles underneath that allow it to crawl slowly. After it consumes the Divine Stone of Judgement, it can produce various types of magic stones, and the transformation speed varies depending on the type of stone."

"All this... you've seen it with your own eyes?"

"We once captured a living one," she said, quite dissatisfied with the prince's skepticism, "The Holy Army made a detour to attack a devil camp far from the battlefield, where there happened to be a Chaos Beast producing luminous magic stones. The witches brought it back to Taquila and made it serve the Holy City—the intelligence of such devils is extremely low, as long as you continuously feed it stones, it will transform them on its own. Unfortunately, we neither knew how to make it produce higher-grade magic stones nor understood how to keep it alive. After half a year, it withered and died like a plant that had its roots cut off."

"Later, the Quest Society also sent several witches to other devil camps to investigate, and the information they brought back confirmed this point—the Chaos Beast is the only way to obtain magic stones. The more powerful the stone, the slower the transformation. Most devils use magic stones for combat, such as the Fierce Devils, who embed stones that can instantly trigger their power in their arms, giving themselves powerful long-range attack abilities. The magic stones we have obtained were all seized from the enemy or their camps."



"So this flight magic stone originally belonged to a demon?" Tilly asked curiously.

"As far as I know, only powerful evil demon lords could possess such a magic stone," Agatha sighed, "It should be a trophy from someone extraordinary."

"What about the types of magic stones?" Roland frowned, "Did they start out with various abilities?"

"Of course not, if that were the case, humans would have been doomed long ago," she rolled her eyes, "During the first Battle of Divine Will, most demons did not wear magic stones. They relied on their immense strength, clad in thick iron armor, and wielding iron spears to attack human cities, which is detailed in historical records. The war lasted for hundreds of years, and after that, human territories were devoured bit by bit, until we were completely pushed back to the Fertile Plains." She sighed, "That was the closest we ever came to victory. If we could have focused on training a combat witch force with witches at the forefront, the demons wouldn't have been able to set foot in the Dawn Realm."

"Then they obtained various magic stones?"

"Probably. By the second Battle of Divine Will, their methods had become more varied," Agatha said in a low tone, "This time the war only lasted thirty-five years, and we were thoroughly defeated. Although the elite God's Punishment Army could contend with the hell lords, the enemy far outnumbered us. I heard from the seniors in the Union that witches could still dominate the battlefield in the first ten years, with a single extraordinary being able to slaughter through the demon armies. But as our losses grew, we could only hold up in the cities."

This time, the prince was silent for a long time, seemingly pondering some serious issue.

It seemed he had finally realized the terrifying aspect of demons as well, Agatha thought. Not only were they numerous, but they were also alarmingly progressive. Who knew what kind of army would appear in this attack?

"Are those Fearsome Demons, Heart Conquerors, and hell lords classifications you made up for the demons?" Tilly asked while Roland was deep in thought.



"Indeed, these names started to spread only after the second Battle of Divine Will—they didn't have much difference aside from their physical appearance before they obtained the magic stones."

"How do they reproduce then?"

"Uh... this," Agatha paused, "I am not sure. There's no record of it in the books, and it's impossible to find out from the captives—without the Red Mist, they die quickly, so we lack the time to understand their language. And those devils that don't need Red Mist are basically low-level beasts, and there's no way to communicate with them."

"Beasts?"

"Yes, the devil species are diverse, but they can be largely divided into two types," she explained in detail, "one with magic power, and one without. The latter can survive without the Red Mist, but in terms of appearance and intelligence, they are no different from animals, such as the eight-legged reptiles that transport materials for the devils, and the fearsome beasts that have wings and can carry devils from the sky."

"Wait," the prince suddenly raised an eyebrow, "the fearsome beast you mentioned, does it look like this?" He pulled out a scroll from a drawer and spread it out in front of Agatha.

"This is indeed a fearsome beast," the winged devil image on the scroll was exquisitely drawn, undoubtedly the work of a witch, "You've seen this kind of devil?"

"Not far from here," Roland took a sip of tea, "I thought it was a demonic beast tamed by devils. So... they are not the same entity?"

"Of course not, the low-level demonic beasts are just food for the devils, and the powerful aberrant demonic beasts are also enemies of the devils. When the Evil Months arrive, their offensive often diminishes sharply, and that is also a breathing space for us." Agatha paused for a moment, shifting the topic to the enemy that was close at hand, "The presence of fearsome beasts means there are devil camps nearby... Where are they?"



"Just to the west of the Misty Forest, behind a huge snow mountain," Roland briefly recounted his exploration experience, "that place has already been covered by the red mist."



"No, not yet!" Agatha said excitedly. "Those low stone towers are the facilities used to maintain the red mist. They continuously evaporate the stored liquid, so they need to be replenished regularly. That's why the Devils are huddled underground, trying to minimize consumption. We can try to take over this camp!"



"Take the initiative to attack the Devils?" The witches all gasped.



"If there are Eye Demons used for vigilance, it means there's a very high chance that there are Chaos Beasts in the camp. Otherwise, a small camp in such a remote location, backed by mountains and sea, wouldn't be set up with a few high-level Devils." She bit her lip. "Chaos Beasts always retain the ability to produce the previous type of magic stone. Even if it's not a high-level magic stone, I can use it to continue the research of the Quest Society. Maybe we can even figure out the transformation principle of the Divine Stone of Judgement!"
