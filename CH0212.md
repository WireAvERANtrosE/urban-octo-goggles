## The Caravan and the New Intelligence
The second month of summer, also known as the Midsummer Day, Margaret arrived as promised.

This time, the merchant caravans brought ships far exceeding the capacity of the docks. Many sailboats could only moor along the riverbank, waiting for the ships ahead to unload before they could dock at the pier.

This made Roland realize that the town's docks must be expanded.

The Greycastle Industrial Company finally completed its task smoothly this month, reducing the defective rate of parts to forty percent and successfully produced three steam engines before the delivery date. Although, compared to the third-generation steam engines currently in use in the town, the factory's export products were inferior in power, leakage, noise, vibration, and other aspects, they still represented a significant improvement over the initial models.

The Crescent Moon Bay caravan brought a three hundred strong artisan troop according to the contract, and Roland settled them all in the industrial park on the south bank of the Redwater River. Apart from building a new wooden workshop next to the existing plant, he also had Karl construct a dormitory for the workers near the riverside of the park. To ensure the facilities were completed within a month, the massive logs were transported to the site, where Karl provided technical guidance and Anna handled the cutting. What was originally the most time-consuming part of the wood processing was completed in just two days, leaving Karl, Anna's former teacher, utterly astonished by her new abilities. In just half a year, this frail and gentle girl had become confident and radiant.

Roland held a lavish banquet in the castle to welcome the merchants.

At the same time, liquor made its first appearance before the crowd.

"Every time I come here, there's something new, Margaret was indeed not lying to me," Hogg exclaimed, "Even the drink is so unique, compared to this... this..."

"Baijiu," Margaret reminded him.



"Yes, liquor! Compared to it, beer and wine are simply bland and tasteless," he grinned and gulped down the drink in his cup, "Your Highness, you must sell me a few cases of this stuff."

"I actually find it too spicy for my taste; fruit wine suits me better," the female merchant said with a smile, shaking her head.

Roland chuckled, "It's a matter of taste. Not everyone can accept high-concentration distilled spirits. I wasn't planning on promoting it widely, just happened to make some to give everyone a taste of something new."

In an era where brewing was still the mainstream, distilled spirits were undoubtedly a rising star with great potential for development, like the liquor, rum, whiskey, and vodka of later generations, which are all high-alcohol content distilled spirits. And on top of these distilled spirits, there was also a whole range of cocktail culture that developed. However, for Border Town at present, it was too early to develop this industry.



"Your Highness, regarding the matter you instructed me to look into in your last letter, I have already had people collect quite a lot of information," Margaret spoke up, "Everwinter has not undergone many changes since being controlled by the Church, whereas the resistance of the Kingdom of Wolfheart has been much stronger. It is said that the Church's army has been gathered at the Toothless Fort, unable to advance a step for more than two months. In addition, the King of Dawn has sent envoys to Greycastle, believing that the Church's actions are not meant to eradicate witches but to occupy the kingdoms on the continent. He has called for an alliance between the two nations to expel the Church's forces and jointly confront the Holy City of Hermes."



"How did the capital respond?" Roland asked.



"Prime Minister Wimbledon, the Marquis of Willow, rejected this proposal and even denounced it as nonsense," Gamor shrugged, "The matter has caused an uproar in the capital, and even the nobles within are not of one mind. As far as I know, quite a few people support the alliance, since the Church currently shows no sign of returning the rule to the rightful heir of Everwinter."



"Timothy didn't make a statement himself?"



"The Prime Minister's response was surely under Timothy's direction. He has already taken his troops to the Eastern Region," Malan's expression grew somewhat solemn, "It is said that a large fleet has landed in Sea Breeze County, ravaging along the coast of the Eastern Region, sparing not even the churches, and many of the Fjords traders have also suffered."



"Large numbers of refugees have appeared in the Eastern Region, both Hog and I have taken in quite a few," Margie added. "They say that the plunderers not only rob them of money and possessions, but they also do not spare people, burning everything that cannot be taken away, as if they want to turn the entire Eastern Region into barren land. This is definitely a heavy blow for Timothy, who has just subjugated the nobles of the Eastern Region."



It should have been a pleasure to hear that Timothy was dealt a blow, but the thought of people being plundered made Roland's heart ache, "Those refugees..."



"Are you interested?" Margie asked with a faint smile. "When I saw that letter, I was wondering if you might want to purchase a large number of slaves to replenish the workforce in your territory. However, compared to the foreign refugees from Eternal Winter and Wolfheart, these people of Greycastle might not be willing to sell themselves into slavery."



"I don't need to make them slaves, as long as these people are willing to settle in Border Town, there will be food and housing, and they will get paid for their work," Roland corrected, realizing at the same time that this was a good opportunity to expand the population, although the news was somewhat delayed, "How many of them are left?"



"Most of the strong and able-bodied refugees have already been taken in by the nobility and merchant caravans. Currently, there are nearly ten thousand people gathered outside the capital city, mostly women and children."



"No matter, I will send someone to screen and guide them," the prince decided. "Do we need to deal with the officials of the capital to take them away?"



"No need," Margie waved her hand. "They would be glad for you to take these people away. Otherwise, if the relief food is not enough and their numbers continue to increase, it could very well lead to a refugee uprising."



...

After the banquet, Roland returned to his office and summoned his personal guard, Theo.



This matter made him realize that his intelligence system was far behind. If he could have known about the refugee incident in time, he could have been prepared earlier and brought more people to Border Town. Currently, his understanding of the outside world was entirely from the merchant caravans, and their once-a-month speed of delivery simply could not meet the demand.



Even if he stationed troops in Longsong Stronghold and established outposts, he could only monitor the Western Territory. To compete for the throne of Greycastle, he must expand his view to the entire country, and even the whole continent.



Roland did not have so many loyal people to form a complete intelligence team, not to mention spies and secret agents lurking in various places. Therefore, he planned to start with the basics, arranging for some people to go to the capital and collect information gathered from all over the place. Without aiming for detailed monitoring, at the very least, he should be able to quickly understand the overall situation and not be as passive as he was today.



Theo, who was very familiar with the dark street forces in the capital, was the prince's best choice.



"You want me to follow the caravan back to the capital?" Theo was stunned.



"That's right, you have two tasks. The first is to shelter refugees coming from the Eastern Territory for me. I will send a squad of about a hundred soldiers responsible for the escort, and I will tell you the detailed selection criteria before the caravan departs."



"Yes!"



"The second point, after the refugee tide is over, you will stay in the capital to collect intelligence for me. You have dealt with the underground rats before, so you should know how to proceed. The Margrave's caravan will fully support you, and any expenses needed for the mission can be directly requested from them. Unlike last time when you went to Redwater City to spread the news about witches, there is no upper limit on the expenses this time." He placed a revolver on the table, "Take care of yourself, and I hope to hear good news from you soon."
