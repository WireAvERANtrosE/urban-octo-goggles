## The Caravan and the New Intelligence
In the second month of summer, also known as the Midsummer Day, Margaret arrived as promised.

This time, the caravans brought far more ships than the dock could accommodate, and many sailboats had to moor by the riverbank, waiting for the ships ahead to finish unloading before they could dock at the pier.

This made Roland realize that the town's dock needed to be expanded.

The Greycastle Industrial Company finally completed its task this month, reducing the defective rate of parts to forty percent and successfully producing three steam engines before the delivery date. Although the factory's export products were significantly inferior in power, air leakage, noise, and vibration compared to the third-generation steam engines currently in use in the town, they represented a considerable improvement over the original models.

The Crescent Bay caravan brought a team of three hundred craftsmen as per the contract, and Roland settled them all in the industrial park on the south bank of the Redwater Riverâ€”besides building a new wooden factory next to the existing plant, he also had Karl construct an employee dormitory near the riverbank of the park. To complete this facility within a month, the massive logs were transported to the site, where Karl was responsible for technical guidance, and Anna handled the cutting. What used to be the most time-consuming part of wood processing was declared finished in just two days, and Karl, Anna's former teacher, was astounded by her new abilities. In just half a year, this slender and gentle girl had become brimming with confidence and vitality.

Roland held a lavish dinner at the castle to welcome the merchants.

At the same time, white liquor made its first appearance before everyone.

"Every time I come here, there's always something new; Margaret certainly did not deceive me," Hogg exclaimed, "Even the liquor is so unique, compared to this... this..."

"White liquor," Margaret reminded him.



"Yes, the liquor! Compared to it, ale and wine are simply bland," he grinned and drained the cup in one gulp, "Your Highness, you must sell me a few cases of this."



"I find it too spicy for my taste; fruit wine suits me better," the female merchant chuckled and shook her head.



Roland smiled, "It's a matter of taste, not everyone can handle the high concentration of distilled spirits. I wasn't planning on popularizing it; I just happened to make some for everyone to try something new."



In an era where brewing is mainstream, distilled spirits are clearly a new star with great potential for development. In later times, liquor like baijiu, rum, whiskey, and vodka are all high-alcohol-content distilled spirits, which also gave rise to a series of cocktail cultures. However, for Border Town at present, it's still too early to develop this industry.



"Your Highness, regarding the matter you instructed me to look into in your last letter, I have gathered quite a bit of information," Margaret spoke up, "Everwinter has not changed much after being taken over by the church, but the resistance in the Kingdom of Dawn is much stronger. It's said that the church's army is all gathered at Tooth Castle, unable to advance an inch for more than two months. Additionally, the King of Dawn sent an envoy to Greycastle, claiming that the church's actions are not aimed at exterminating witches, but rather at occupying the kingdoms of the continent. He called for the two nations to form an alliance to expel the church's influence and jointly confront the Holy City of Hermes."



"How did the capital respond?" Roland asked.



"The Marquis of Wimbledon, the Prime Minister before the king, rejected the proposal and even rebuked it as nonsensical," Gammon shrugged, "The issue has caused an uproar in the capital, and even within the nobility, there is no consensus. As far as I know, many support the alliance, especially since the church has shown no signs of returning sovereignty to the rightful heir of Everwinter."



"Timothy didn't make an appearance?"



"The Prime Minister's response must have been under Timothy's direction; he himself has already taken the army to the Eastern Region," Malt said with a somber expression, "I've heard that a huge fleet landed in Seawindshire and has been plundering along the coast of the Eastern Region, sparing not even the churches, and many merchants from the fjords have also suffered."



"The Eastern Region has already seen a large number of refugees, and both Hogg and I have taken in quite a few," Margaret added. "They say that these marauders not only rob money and goods, but also people, burning everything they can't carry, as if they intend to turn the entire Eastern Region into barren land. This is definitely a heavy blow for Timothy, who has just subdued the nobles of the Eastern Region."



It should have been a pleasure to hear of Timothy's plight, but upon hearing that the marauders were taking captives, Roland felt a pang of distress. "Those refugees..."



"Are you interested?" Margaret asked with a light smile. "When I saw that letter, I was wondering if you might want to buy a large number of slaves to bolster the labor on your own lands. However, compared to the foreign refugees from Everwinter and Wolfheart, these people from Greycastle might not be willing to sell themselves into slavery."



"I don't need them as slaves. As long as these people are willing to settle in Border Town, there will be food and housing, and they will be paid for their work," Roland corrected, realizing at the same time that this was a good opportunity to increase his population, although the news had come a bit late. "How many of them are there still?"



"The physically strong refugees have mostly been taken in by the nobles and merchant caravans, but there are still nearly ten thousand people gathered outside the capital, mostly women and children."



"That's alright, I'll send people to screen and guide them," the prince decided. "Do I need to deal with the officials from the capital to take them away?"



"No need," Margaret waved her hand. "They would be glad for you to take these people off their hands. Otherwise, if the relief food is not enough and their numbers continue to increase, it could very well lead to a refugee uprising."



...

After the banquet ended, Roland returned to his office and called for his personal guard, Tassa.



This made him realize that his intelligence system was very outdated. If he had known about the refugee incident in time, he could have prepared earlier, and brought more people to Border Town. Currently, all his information about the outside world came from merchant caravans, and the monthly frequency of updates was far from meeting his needs.



Even with troops stationed at Longsong Stronghold and outposts established, they could only monitor the Western Territory. To contend for the throne of Greycastle, it was necessary to extend his gaze to the entire nation, or even the whole continent.



Roland did not have enough loyal personnel to establish a complete intelligence network, not to mention spies and secret agents infiltrating everywhere. Therefore, he planned to start from the basics by arranging some people to go to the capital and collect information gathered from various places. He might not achieve detailed monitoring, but at least he could quickly understand the overall situation and not be as passive as today.



Tassa, who was very familiar with the powers of the capital's backstreets, was the prince's best choice.



"You want me to follow the caravan back to the capital?" Tassa asked, stunned.



"That's right. You have two tasks. The first is to take in refugees from the Eastern Territory for me. I'll send a squad of about a hundred soldiers to escort them, and I'll tell you the detailed selection criteria before the caravan departs."



"Yes!"



"The second point, after the refugee crisis is over, you'll stay in the capital and collect information from all over for me. You've dealt with the underground rats before, so you should know how to do it. Margret's caravan will fully support you, and you can directly ask them for the expenses required for the mission. Unlike last time when you went to spread the news about witches around Redwater City, this time there is no spending limit." He placed a revolving pistol on the table, "Take care of yourself, and I hope to hear good news from you soon."
