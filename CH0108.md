## Echo (Part 1)
Two weeks had passed since the Evil Months, and the snow had melted into streams that flowed into the Redwater River.



After the white veil had receded, the woods on both sides burst into new buds, now lush with greenery.



The land outside the eastern part of the town, once scorched by Anna, had been temporarily designated by His Highness as the practice field for the First Army of Border Town.



In the field, Carter Lannis grasped the hilt sleeve of the knife and twisted it, checking whether the bayonet was securely attached.



This was another new contraption invented by His Highness, but compared to the auto-operating black lump of a machine and the improved blasting snow powder that could explode with a spark, this contraption was far too rudimentary. As soon as Carter held it in his hand, he knew it was not a qualified weapon.



Essentially, it was nothing more than a sharp triangular iron sheet, slightly bent along the centerline. Although it had an edge, it was virtually impossible to use it to slash at a target—the bent sides of the blade were extremely short, almost non-existent at the front, and only as wide as a thumbnail at the back. Even against an enemy without armor, a horizontal slash might not even cut through their clothes.



This weapon had only one purpose: thrusting, and it had to be attached to a musket to be used. Holding it alone, it was even less useful than a dagger.



Wasting a large amount of iron to produce a weapon with a single mode of attack was naturally seen as a defective product in the eyes of the Chief Knight. If a blacksmith in his domain dared do such a thing, he would certainly tie the man up and give him a severe lashing.



But even with such an inferior weapon, he could see the unique details that His Highness had implemented, such as the design of the socket's slot. With two right angles in a bayonet joint, one only needed to align it with the small iron bar on the barrel, slide it in, and then give it a half-turn to fix the bayonet onto the barrel. The irregular shape of the bayonet joint meant that the socket and barrel didn't need to fit closely, and if the socket was too loose, one could stuff some paper before twisting it. In its absence, leaves could even suffice.



"Fix bayonets!"

Upon hearing the command, members of the Gun Battalion who had been issued bayonets promptly drew their blades from the sheaths strapped to their waists and fitted them onto their musket barrels—the new weapons and accompanying sheaths had only been produced in a little over forty units, and those who hadn't received one had to make do with a short wooden pole of the same length as the musket for the time being.

They had practiced this set of movements for an entire morning, and now most of them could fix their bayonets in just two to three breaths' time. According to His Highness, this was the final struggle, and he hoped not to see his subordinates enter into hand-to-hand combat unless absolutely necessary. Carter disagreed with this; without thrusting a sword or dagger into the enemy's flesh, one was still but a fledgling. Only with bloodshed could they transform from miners and hunters into warriors.

Iron Axe was also in the ranks; although he claimed to be a hunter, Carter could tell from the man's skills that he had definitely received specialized combat training and was no less capable than a knight.

When His Highness had initially requested that Carter teach the soldiers how to perform bayonet thrusts, he had felt somewhat uneasy—having never heard of a bayonet before, what if he couldn't use it himself? However, upon seeing the prototype, his confidence surged; it was essentially a short spear, and due to the blade's particularity, it was even easier to wield than a spear.

The single advantage of the bayonet's singular mode of attack was that it was convenient for training. There were no chops, thrusts, parries, or sweeps—just one motion, the stab. The Chief Knight arranged the troops in several rows and instructed them on the most effective stabbing motion—standing with one leg forward and one back, bending at the waist and knees, extending both arms with all their might.

Such repetitive training was extremely dull, yet to Carter's amazement, everyone performed their stabbing motions meticulously. If it had been before winter, these same people were a bunch of weak and indolent civilians, but now they behaved quite professionally. They would execute commands immediately upon hearing them, and training them was even less trouble than training his own squires. Of course, if they were given swords, or what His Highness referred to as "cold weapons," these people would still not last three moves under his command. Yet in terms of willpower, their progress was enough to earn his approval.

After half an hour of practice, Carter had the Gun Battalion sit down on the spot to rest for a while. It was at this time that His Royal Highness, the prince, appeared on the training field, accompanied by a woman wearing a hood. The knight was not surprised; His Highness had already informed him in advance that today's training would involve the cooperation of a witch.

However, the witch was quite tall, almost eye level with His Highness. Carter thought that girls should be more delicate. He then had everyone stand up and salute the Fourth Prince.



"Your Highness!" The soldiers raised their hands to their foreheads and shouted loudly.



"Hard at work," Roland nodded, walking over to the knight ready to speak when suddenly a burly man burst out from the ranks. Carter Lannis frowned, stepping forward to protect the prince with his body, his hand already on the hilt of his sword. Nightingale also revealed herself immediately, grabbing Roland's arm. If anything went amiss, she would pull the prince into the Mist.



The burly man who rushed out was Iron Axe.



He did not run towards the prince but knelt directly in front of the woman, not with the single-knee salute of the continental kingdoms, but by lying prostrate on the ground, with his head deeply buried between his arms, "Chieftain!"



The musketeer training was forced to a halt.

...

"So, what exactly happened here?"



In the castle hall, Carter, Echo, and Iron Axe stood in a row, with Roland sitting in the main seat, asking with slight dissatisfaction.



Discipline, discipline! How many times have I emphasized it? The troops should have iron-like discipline! You shouldn't be moved even upon seeing the Chieftain, let alone the King. If you really have a request, you can file a report. Roland had thought highly of Iron Axe, and thinking of this, he couldn't help but sigh. In the end, it's still a matter of cultural quality not keeping up, not being able to thoroughly understand the meaning of discipline.



"Your Highness," Iron Axe couldn't help wanting to kneel as soon as he spoke, but his knee was only halfway bent when Roland stopped him.

"Speak while standing!"

"...Yes," the latter swallowed and said, "Lady Silvermoon was the chieftain of the clan I swore allegiance to when I was in Iron Sand City."

"No, Kabago, I'm not the chieftain..." Echo hurriedly waved her hands in denial.

"No, you are," Iron Axe argued, "After your father and elder brother passed away, according to the Mojin customs, from that moment on, you became the chieftain of the Ashei Clan. I heard you were sold to Clearwater Harbor, but I couldn't find you there, I thought you had...died."

"But I—"

Roland interrupted Echo's words, "One at a time, Iron Axe you first."

"As you command, Your Highness."

...



The story was not complicated, and Roland soon understood the general course of events.



Echo was originally a member of the Ashes Clan in Iron Sand City, her real name being Jolene Silvermoon. Her father was the chief of the Ashes Clan.



The Sand People were not a single entity, and since Iron Sand City could only accommodate a limited population, every three years, the various clans had to engage in sacred duels in the Scorched Ground. Only the six victorious clans would earn the right to reside within the city, while the other clans had to either live outside the city or cluster in the Green Sea. Though these dwelling places also had water sources, the wild beasts and sandstorms posed a great threat to the Sand People, which is why the warriors from each clan spared no effort in the sacred duels.
