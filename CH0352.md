## Illusion (Part 2)
So that's how it is!



Maine stared intently at the illusion, his shock indescribable. 



The God's Punishment Army transformation ceremony was actually invented by witches, who, in their determination to defeat the demons, did not hesitate to use their own kind as sacrifices... How many people here would stand up on the spot and denounce her ruthlessness?



The outcome was beyond his expectation. After half an hour, not a single person stood up. Even the witch who had questioned the ceremony did not openly oppose Akaris' words. She merely clenched her teeth and slammed the table hard, "How ironic! To kill so many witches by our own hands, all for the continuity of witches. Could there be anything more laughable?"



"But what she said is not wrong," an older witch spoke, "We ultimately originate from mortals. When all of humanity perishes, witches will no longer exist."



"On the other hand," Elaine shrugged, "no matter how many witches are sacrificed in the transformation ceremony, new witches will always appear to replace them. The more mortals there are, the more witches there will be."



"Can the God's Punishment Army really defeat the demons?" someone asked.



"I don't know," Akaris spoke again, "No one knows the answer before we try. The failures of the previous two Divine Wills have made several things clear—that the power of the demons far surpasses ours, and the only thing that limits their movement is the Red Mist. This means that even if we create a large number of God's Punishment Warriors, we may still not achieve final victory." She paused, "But you should know my style of doing things."



Elaine smiled, "Even if there's only a glimmer of possibility, we must do everything we can."



"I am willing to follow you," she said.

"For the continuation of the witches."

"I don't want to just give up either."

Everyone stood up one after another, saluting the Queen of Witches.

The witch who had raised the question was the last to stand, stating, "I hope you're right."

"Then it's decided," Agatha nodded, apparently not surprised by the outcome, "Next, we need to persuade the other members of the Union."

"They may not necessarily obey you," the elder witch said, "To implement the God's Punishment Army transformation without resistance, witches cannot exist as a privileged class. The Union must be dissolved, and everything that has happened must be completely buried."

"I will do my best to convince them," Agatha's voice was unwavering, "If they cannot accept it, Starfall City will move forward with this plan alone and forge a new order."

Subsequently, the scene vanished... Darkness once again engulfed everything, and when the light in the secret chamber returned to normal, Mayne realized that his back was soaked with cold sweat, and his mind was dizzy.



"You seem a bit tired, do you need me to help you out?" Scroll walked over and asked.

"No need, just go open the door!" he gasped.

After the metal door was pushed open, Maine staggered out of the illusion room, covering his mouth as he ran down the praying platform and knelt in front of O'Brien.

"It is normal to feel unwell after the magic stone is activated, as the images are automatically projected into your mind," the Pope said softly. "I had the same reaction when I first encountered these, and you will recover after some rest."

"Why am I fine?" Scroll asked, holding onto the Pope's arm.

"Because you are a witch, your body has long been accustomed to the flow of magic," O'Brien said with a benevolent smile. "In terms of both endurance and resistance, witches generally far surpass ordinary people."

It took Maine a long time to catch his breath. "Is this the origin of the Church?"

"That's right, after Akaris led Fallen Star City to fight against the witches from the other two cities, and ultimately emerged victorious, establishing new rules—witches were no longer the chosen ones exalted by the gods, but sinners led astray by the devil. This war lasted nearly a hundred years and is known in the history books as the Battle of Faith."

"Did she live that long?"



The Pope shook his head, "Akaris died together with another extraordinary being shortly after establishing the church. The second Pope inherited her will, continuing to lead the army in battle until she had completely subdued the other two factions—sadly, this war greatly weakened the Three Cities, and they nearly lost their control over the secular world. Those mortals who were unwilling to participate in the Witch Wars began to settle in this narrow continent, leading the locals to cultivate and build, gradually forming the current four major kingdoms."

For some reason, O'Brien became more spirited as he spoke, his voice becoming coherent and losing the previous sense of weakness.

"Although the Church has swept through those remnants many times since then, including the mortals not belonging to Starfall City, the secular pattern had already been formed. Due to the Church's lack of follow-through, they ultimately failed to unify the continent. This all boils down to the fact that the Witch Queen died too early."

"Not only did Natalia, whom she regarded as a friend, not accept her plan, but she also launched a sudden attack on Akaris at the meeting, a scene that was recorded in the complete holy scriptures," the Pope sighed, "If she were still alive, the Battle of Faith could have ended fifty years earlier, and by then the Church could have unified the continent after taking in all the witches. No one could have imagined that this delay would last until now."

Mayne wiped the sweat from his forehead, "Your Majesty, there is something I don't understand. Why were the previous Popes all witches, but later they all became ordinary people?"

"Gerald, you may leave," O'Brien said after a moment of silence.

"Yes."

After the Purifier left, he slowly began to speak, "Because of cowardice and fear."

"Wha... what?" He was stunned for a moment, doubting whether he had heard wrong.



"No, child, you heard correctly," O'Brien seemed to have seen through his thoughts, his eyes sparkling, as if he had returned to his youthful self, "In order to wait until the devil is defeated and the glory of the witches can be restored, Akaris once decreed that the position of Pope must be held by an extraordinary person. But extraordinary witches are very rare, and it is not always possible to find a suitable candidate. In time, some outstanding ordinary witches have also served as Pope—however, weakness and cowardice are like vipers in the heart, unstoppable once they appear. The mortal Archbishops, fearing one day they would be held accountable by the oppressed witches, usurped the position of Pope."



Maine widened his eyes, "So the Popes after that were all..."



"Correct, we are all cowards who have stolen the sacrifices of the witches," the Pope let out a long, murky breath, "No matter what the future holds, the Church will bury this secret forever." He paused, "As for the true nature of the Battle of Divine Will, it is all recorded in the Secret Holy Temple, and now it is up to you to shoulder it all and continue on. Even giving up... would be a wise choice."



After saying these words, he seemed to relax all at once, as if he had shed a heavy burden, lying back on the cart.



Give up? If I were to give up, who else could take this position? But before Maine could think further, he noticed something wrong with O'Brien—his condition was deteriorating rapidly, the spirited appearance just a brief flash of vigor before the end, and now his gaze was quickly dispersing, his light dimming.



"Your Eminence, O'Brien Your Eminence!" Maine stepped forward anxiously and shook him, but he just stared emptily at the ceiling, his lips slightly parted, as if murmuring something.



In the last moment, Maine thought he heard him say, "Child, I am sorry."
