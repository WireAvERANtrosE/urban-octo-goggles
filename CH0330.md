## Farewell
The next day, Roland saw off Lily and Honey in the castle's back garden. Although he did not want the two to leave so soon, after hearing that the Pretty Woman was still waiting in the shoals, he decided not to delay any longer—this would at least show his magnanimity and would not make Tilly feel embarrassed. Putting himself in their shoes, it was already a sincere gesture that the other party had sent important witches to Border Town before the large-scale construction on Sleeping Island had started. Given this, he should not be too demanding.



To avoid a long trek through the snow, Anna and Wendy were the ones to send them to the ship. Using the Looking Forward, it would only take half an hour to reach the shoals.



"Thank you for taking care of us these past few months," the two said, bowing before Roland.



"I should be thanking you," Roland smiled, "You have made many contributions to the construction of Border Town. I have two gifts for you."



"Gi-gifts?" Lily was slightly stunned, her cheeks flushing with a touch of red.



Honey touched her own chest, then glanced at Lily's, and excitedly asked, "Do we get them too?"



Roland took two bags from Nightingale and handed them over, "Yes, both of you."



Unable to wait, Honey quickly opened her bag and pulled out a long white ribbon, "Eh? What's this? Isn't it a bra?"



"*Cough cough*, this is a scarf," he stepped forward, lifting the pure cotton fabric, and wrapped it around her neck in loops, "Now you won't have to fear the cold wind and snowflakes getting inside your neck. Wrap it a bit thicker, and it can even cover your ears."

"Mmm... so warm," the latter exclaimed with a satisfied face.

It might have been an illusion, but Wendy's face seemed to turn even redder.

"There's something else inside," Honey played with the scarf for a while, then pulled out a small square from the bag, "Your Highness, is this also a gift?"

"Correct, open it and see."

"Wow, so shiny!" she lifted the iron box, exclaimed excitedly, "Wendy, look, you can clearly see your own reflection!"

It was a small mirror set in a wooden box, one of the products introduced to the convenience market. In Roland's life experience, no woman could resist such shiny objects.

Honey's exclamation drew the attention of the other witches, and soon the witches of Sleeping Island gathered around, admiring their reflections in the makeup mirror, unable to suppress their joy and envy—after all, this crystal glass mirror made with Soria's coating was far superior in reflectivity and overall imaging compared to silver mirrors, and this also showed Roland a new way to win people over.

After the gifts were given, the hot air balloon was also filled with air. The two climbed into the gondola, waving goodbye to Roland and the witches. It was clear to see that they felt somewhat reluctant to leave the town.



"I must say, this is indeed a nice place," Tilly walked up to his side and whispered, "Convenient water supply, comfortable rooms, it's hard to believe that you transformed a barren land into what it is today in just a year."



"Do you regret it?"



"Are you referring to sending the witches to the town?" She smiled, "How could I? If I can make their lives better, why would I have any regrets? Don't forget, I am a witch too."



In the stark white garden, Tilly's smile was like a pristine snowflake, so beautiful it was devoid of color. If there were such a sister in future generations, the rate at which heads turned would certainly be one hundred percent. But Roland knew in his heart that her relationship with him was more like that of a collaborator, a natural ally, rather than just a sister. This could be seen from her decision yesterday—to face potential threats, she even dared to venture into dangerous places herself.



"Are you really going to such a dangerous place?" Roland asked, "Although you are an extraordinary witch, your abilities aren't suited for combat, right?"



"Don't worry, I'm not completely without the ability to protect myself." Tilly stretched out her hands, showing the prince the ornaments in her hands—on the ring finger of her left hand, she wore a blue crystal ring, and on her right, she wore a white silk glove with a red gemstone embedded on the back. Honestly, such a combination looked quite odd, an asymmetrical attire that seemed like a trendy mix-and-match style from future fashion runways. He had been very curious about this since yesterday, but had not asked out of politeness.



"These are magic stones, peculiar stones discovered from ancient ruins," she explained, "When infused with magic power, they can exhibit different abilities. For instance, this ring allows me to fly freely like lightning."



Having said that, as if to prove her point, she slowly rose from the ground, her body floating weightlessly in mid-air, startling Roland.



Can abilities really be changed through a stone?



He quickly realized the profound significance contained within.

If abilities could be mass-produced, the witches' work efficiency would be greatly enhanced—take Lily for example, if the Witch Union could all possess a magic stone simulating Lily's ability, they could finish constructing the temporary residential area in just one day.

After Tilly landed, she pointed her right hand towards an empty space, and a bright flash of lightning burst forth from her fingertip, blasting a bowl-sized hole through the snow deep enough to reach the ankle, revealing the dark soil underneath.

"So you can possess two abilities at the same time?" Roland asked in surprise.

"No," Tilly shook her head, "the magic stone only allows one ability to appear within a certain range. If I try to infuse magic into two stones at the same time, then nothing will happen." She then smiled, "I originally didn't plan to reveal this news to you so soon, but after last night's meeting ended, I thought that I might have misunderstood you... I'm glad you could be honest about the ancient relics... and I feel a bit apologetic."

"That's alright, I can understand."

"By the way, I'm curious, what is this 'bra' that Honey mentioned?"

Roland nearly choked on his saliva, "Cough cough, I'm not too sure myself... perhaps you could ask Sylvie or Evelyn."

"Alright," Tilly shrugged, "it seems you still have reservations towards me."



The prince was somewhat caught between laughter and tears for a moment.



"Let's not talk about this," she blinked and said, "I've been thinking about something last night. If these relics all belong to the Church, why would they abandon all the magic stones? According to Ashes' experience, it's very likely that the Church was also raising witches, and these things were equally important to them. Even fleeing in disarray after a battle with the devils and deliberately burying the outcome of the war should not have stopped them from continuing to use these stones—it makes no sense at all."



"The Church doesn't care about this loss?" Roland pondered, but he quickly dismissed his own thought, "No, they should not be able to mass-produce these magic stones, otherwise they would have used them when pursuing the runaway witches of the Sleeping Spell in the wild. After all, if they could fly, most people wouldn't be able to escape the pursuit of the Church's witches."



"Indeed, I recalled all the books about the Church and the deity in the royal library and found something very strange... Their historical records not only stop more than four hundred years ago, but even the origins of the deity are vague, with no illustrious titles, no epic legends. Aside from proclaiming its omnipotence and omniscience, there are no further details. At least compared to the ancient three gods, it seems much more nebulous. Putting the two together, it inevitably gives one a strange feeling."



"What?" Roland felt a chill in his heart.



"The Church is like it suddenly popped up out of nowhere."
