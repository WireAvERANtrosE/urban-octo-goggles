## Eve of the Festival
A week passed quickly, and it was time for the scouting team to set out.

Roland summoned Barov, Carter, and Iron Axe to the castle, informing them that he would be leaving the town for two days, and that the affairs of Border Town should continue as usual according to the established plans and regulations.

Of course, this announcement was met with unanimous opposition from the three men. Carter wished to fulfill his duty as the Chief Knight and stay by the prince's side; Iron Axe requested to form a hundred-man team for protection; Barov, on the grounds that the decrees issued by the City Hall needed the lord's review and seal to take effect, advised him to stay in the castle. In the end, Roland had to assert his authority as the lord and demanded that everyone follow his orders.

"Your Highness, I don't understand. What is so important that you must go personally?" Barov asked, puzzled.

"This matter concerns the survival of the Western Region... even the Kingdom of Greycastle," Roland said after a moment of silence. "And only I can make the best judgment."

"Can't you... tell us the specific reason?"

"Not for now, but you will all know one day," he shook his head. "Additionally, this trip is a confidential operation, and you must not leak any information to anyone."

The idea that a devil's stronghold could be stationed more than two hundred kilometers away from the Western Region, and that these devils had once destroyed the Holy City of Taquila, driving the resisters to the edge of the continent, and turning the wasteland into a forbidden zone that no one dared to set foot in, was too shocking to disclose.

Roland himself was somewhat desensitized to such apocalyptic scenarios from watching many end-of-the-world movies, but for them, such a truth might be too hard to accept. If the news leaked, it would cause even more trouble; a panic among the citizens might lead to a massive exodus from the Western Region.



Therefore, now is not the right time to announce the truth.

After finishing with the political affairs, Roland and the witches took a hot air balloon from the front courtyard of the castle, ascending into the sky, and flew towards the Snow Mountain.

"Your Highness, if it was indeed the church that resisted the devils over four hundred years ago, were they good or bad?" Ever since learning about the existence of devils, Sylvie has been visibly troubled.

"Of course, they're bad," Nightingale replied before Roland could speak, "Have you ever seen any kind-hearted person hunt witches for no reason? If we really were minions of the devils, that would be one thing, but all the sisters know, witches have nothing to do with devils, and the notion of demonic possession is absurd."

Yet Sylvie continued to gaze at Roland, as if she wanted to hear his answer.

After pondering for a moment, Roland said, "Firstly, whether it was the church fighting against the devils is still to be confirmed. If they truly made such great sacrifices, why would they conceal the news and destroy all past records? Promoting this feat would be the best way to expand their congregation. This question can probably only be answered after finding more clues. Besides, good and bad cannot be so simply distinguished; it depends on which side you stand on." With a smile, Roland added, "What you actually want to ask is whether I would stand with the church to fight against the devils, right?"

"I..." Sylvie opened her mouth but did not deny it.

"The church and the royal power are inherently incompatible, even without the witches, I would not stand with the church," he spread his hands and said, "Moreover, now I have you all by my side."

"I told you," Nightingale said with a proud smile, "even if the church had fought against the devils in the past, they lost, and it was a miserable defeat. With His Highness, we still don't know who would lose or win, so why join the side of the losers?"



"...I understand," she nodded gently, and the gloom between her brows seemed to lighten a little.

Thus, as dusk fell, the outline of the Snowy Mountain became faintly visible to the group.

It was indeed colossal, Roland thought, rarely had he ever seen such a towering peak. There were no other mountains nearby to complement it; it was as if the earth had suddenly leaped up without warning, leaving behind a path that reached to the heavens. The grey and murky mountain face occupied most of the horizon, and to bypass the foot of the mountain by land would probably take several months.

The campsite was chosen on top of a mountain ridge closer to the sea, which not only allowed for convenient observation of the surroundings but also kept them far from the Misty Forest, ensuring that wild beasts could not easily approach the camp.

After finishing their dry food, everyone began to set up tents. Since the hot air balloon had a limited carrying capacity, only one large tent could be brought along. Therefore, Roland, upholding a spirit of noble sacrifice, allowed the witches to sleep together in the tent, while he slept in the basket, and Maggie in the treesâ€”after all, once she transformed into a bird, she could sleep even while standing.

He found that he was, after all, a bit too shy to sleep together with all the witches, despite Wendy and Scroll's suggestion that they take the basket and let His Highness sleep in the tent, which he rejected one after another.

Only Sylvie kept giving Roland a wary look during the accommodation arrangements, which made him feel both amused and helpless.

After assigning the night watch, everyone crawled into their tents. Since the bottom of the basket was uneven, Roland found it difficult to fall asleep, so he simply sat on a rock facing the sea, staring at the sea surface illuminated by the bright moonlight in a daze.

It was then that he heard faint footsteps behind him.



The prince turned his head and found that the person who came was actually Anna.

Back when he was in school, whenever there was a group outing, he would always harbor expectations for "something might happen," even though most of them ended up being wishful thinking. But that didn't stop him from looking forward to the next event.

However, when this scene really arrived, Roland found his heartbeat accelerating. Pretending to be nonchalant, he raised his eyebrows slightly, "What's up, can't sleep?"

"No," Anna said frankly, "I just wanted to come and keep you company."

"Is that so?" he coughed twice, "Thank you."

"It is I who should say thank you," Anna smiled. The silver moonlight sprinkled on her face, emitting a faint glow; her deep blue eyes seemed deeper than the ocean, "The words you said to Sylvie... although she didn't give thanks, I could see that she felt much more at ease."

"Are you happy for her?"

"No," she shook her head, "I am happy for my own choice."

Roland was taken aback, "What... choice?"



Anna didn't answer, but instead closed her eyes and kissed his face. It took a while before she spoke softly, "Goodnight, Your Highness."



This also counts as 'something happening'... right?



Watching her return to the tent, Roland stretched contentedly, intending to head back to his hammock to sleep, when an invisible pair of hands cradled his face. There was clearly nothing in front of him, yet once again, a soft touch came upon his face, but this time, it was on the other side. "And me, Your Highness. Thank you for all you've done for the witches."
