## The Eve
A week passed by quickly, and it was time for the scouting team to set off.

Roland summoned Barov, Carter, and Iron Axe to the castle, informing them that he would be leaving the town for two days, and that the affairs of Border Town were to continue as usual according to the plans and regulations already established.



Of course, this announcement was unanimously opposed by the three men. Carter wished to fulfill his duty as the Chief Knight and stay by the prince's side; Iron Axe requested that a hundred-man team be dispatched for protection; Barov, using the reason that the decrees issued by the City Hall needed the lord's review and stamp before taking effect, advised him to stay in the castle. In the end, Roland had to pull rank as the lord and demand that everyone act according to his orders.



"Your Highness, I don't understand. What is so important that you must personally undertake this journey?" Barov asked, puzzled.



"This matter concerns the West; it even concerns the survival of the Kingdom of Greycastle," Roland paused before speaking, "and only I can make the best judgment."



"You can't... tell us the specific reasons?"



"Not for the time being, but you will all know one day," he shook his head, "Moreover, this trip is a secret operation, and you must not leak any information to anyone."



The possibility that the devil's stronghold, situated over two hundred kilometers from the Western Region, and these devils who had once destroyed the Holy City of Taquila, driving the resistors to the edge of the continent and turning the wasteland into forbidden grounds that no one dared to tread upon, was too shocking to reveal.



As for himself, he was somewhat desensitized to apocalyptic scenarios, having seen many such movies, but for them, it would probably be difficult to accept such a reality. If the news leaked, it could be even more troublesome; it might cause panic among the populace, potentially leading to a mass exodus from the Western Region.



Therefore, it is not yet the appropriate time to announce the truth.

After dealing with political affairs, Roland and the witches took off in a hot air balloon from the castle's front courtyard, flying towards the snowy mountains.



"Your Highness, if it was really the Church that fought against the demons over four hundred years ago, were they good or bad?" Ever since learning of the existence of demons, Sylvie had been visibly preoccupied.



"Of course they're bad," Roland had not even spoken when Nightingale interjected, "Have you ever seen kind people who would hunt down witches for no reason? If we were really the minions of demons, that would be one thing, but all the sisters know that witches have nothing to do with demons, and the talk of the demonic plague is completely baseless."



However, she continued to stare intently at Roland, as if wanting to hear his answer.



After pondering for a moment, he said, "First of all, whether it was the Church fighting against the demons is still to be confirmed. If they really made such a great sacrifice, why hide the news and destroy all past records? Broadcasting this event would be the best way to expand their following. This question can probably only be answered after finding more clues. Besides, good and evil can't be so simply defined; it depends on which side you're on." With that, Roland smiled, "What you actually want to ask is whether I would side with the Church to fight against the demons, right?"



"I..." Sylvie opened her mouth but did not deny it.



"The powers of the Church and the monarchy are inherently incompatible; even without the witches, I would not stand with the Church," he spread his hands, "What's more, now I have all of you by my side."



"I told you," Nightingale said with a triumphant smile, "Even if the Church had fought against the demons in the past, they lost, and it was a terrible defeat. With His Highness, it's still unknown who would win or lose, so why would we side with the losers?"



"......I understand," she nodded lightly, and the gloom between her brows seemed to fade a bit.

Thus, as dusk fell, the party could faintly make out the outline of the Impassable Mountain Range.

It was indeed massive, Roland thought, even he had rarely seen such towering peaks. There were no surrounding mountains to complement it, as if the earth had suddenly leapt up without warning, leaving behind a path to the heavens. The gray mountain walls occupied most of the horizon, and to bypass the foot of the mountain by land would probably take several months.

The campsite was chosen at the top of a ridge closer to the sea, which allowed for easy observation of the surroundings and was also far from the Misty Forest, ensuring that wild beasts could not easily approach the camp.

After finishing their dry food, everyone started to set up tents. Since the hot air balloon had a limited carrying capacity, only one large tent could be brought along. Therefore, Roland, in the spirit of high-mindedness, let the witches sleep in the tent collectively, while he slept in the basket, and Maggie slept in the treesâ€”after all, once transformed into a bird, she could fall asleep even while standing.

He found that his skin was ultimately a bit too thin to sleep with the witches in the same place, although Wendy and Soraya suggested that they could take the basket and let His Highness sleep in the tent. However, he refused each offer.

Only Sylvie kept giving Roland a wary look during the arrangement of the sleeping quarters, which left him feeling both amused and helpless.

After arranging the night watch, everyone crawled into their tents. Since the bottom of the basket was uneven, Roland had trouble falling asleep for a while, so he simply sat on a rock facing the sea, staring at the sea surface bathed in the bright moonlight in a daze.

Just then, he heard faint footsteps behind him.



The prince turned his head and discovered that the newcomer was actually Anna.



In the past, whenever there was a school trip, he always harbored some hope for "something to happen," even though most of these ended as mere wishful thinking. However, this did not prevent him from looking forward to the next event.



But when the moment actually arrived, Roland found his heart beating faster. Pretending to be nonchalant, he raised an eyebrow, "What's up, can't sleep?"



"No," Anna said plainly, "I just wanted to come and keep you company."



"Is that so?" He coughed twice, "Thank you."



"It is I who should be saying thank you," Anna said with a smile. The silver moonlight sprinkled on her face, casting a faint glow; her deep blue eyes seemed even more profound than the ocean, "The words you said to Sylvie... although she didn't express her gratitude, I could see that she was much more at ease."



"Are you happy for her?"



"No," she shook her head, "I'm happy for the choice I've made."



Roland paused, "What... choice?"



Anna did not answer, but instead closed her eyes and planted a kiss on his cheek. After a long while, she softly said, "Goodnight, Your Highness."

That also counts as 'something happened'... right?

Watching her return to the tent, Roland stretched contentedly, intending to also return to the hanging basket to sleep, when a pair of invisible hands cupped his face. There was clearly nothing in front of him, yet once again a soft touch came upon his face, this time, however, it was on the other cheek. "Me too, Your Highness. Thank you for all you've done for the witches."
