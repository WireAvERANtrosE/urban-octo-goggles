## Ancient Books and Ruins (Part 2)
What does this mean? Roland stroked the row of characters. Had the owner of the ancient book fought against those monsters from the Barbarian Land? He moved his gaze downward—



"More and more devils are appearing, while our numbers dwindle."



"The God's Punishment Stones are also powerless to stop their onslaught. With their unmatched brute strength, even without relying on magic power, they are fierce and dreadful enemies."



"The Holy City of Taquila has fallen, and we are scattered and fleeing."



"We cross over great mountains and rivers, running as far from the gate of hell as possible."



"But where can we flee to next time?"



"However, this is no longer something I need to consider, as I am close to death, Natalia."



"The power of the devils is corrupting me, and no medicine works."



"I write this only because there is something I wish to entrust to you."



"The trial of the God's Punishment Army by Akaris is nearing its end, and it's been a success. The extraordinary warriors can even face devils without falling behind. But she forgot, in the end, even if the God's Punishment Army is victorious, that victory does not belong to us."

"That's right, the God's Punishment Army will only bring us destruction."

"Go stop her. You're the only one who can do it."

The text was not long, and Roland read it from beginning to end before closing his eyes to ponder, trying to put himself in Cara's perspective.



Assuming she didn't know about the existence of devils, and replacing devils with witches, this description would easily be imagined by her as the Church's army being defeated by the witches. Then, combining the widely spread rumor—that witches are the minions of devils, and that their magic comes from the Gates of Hell—Cara might very well believe that the Church actually wants to hide the true fact: that the so-called Gates of Hell are actually the entrance to the Holy Mountain, that for hundreds of years, witches have been going to the Holy Mountain and gaining eternal life there. That's why there are more and more witches, and fewer and fewer warriors of the Church.



Of course, this speculation also had many flaws. For example, the notes mentioned that the other party possessed strength far beyond that of ordinary people, which was clearly not a characteristic of witches. Also, the fact that witches could still rout the Church's army under the influence of the God's Punishment Stones seemed too incredible. So what exactly made Cara determined to go to the Fertile Plains, he did not yet know. Was it her overly anxious mood that affected her judgment, or was there content in some parts of the books she had not managed to read that was the real inducement?



Roland was more inclined to the latter.

He now knew at least that the devils described in the last page of hasty notes were not witches, but a real, different species of beings.



But this did not lessen his confusion; on the contrary, it made the unknown questions even more numerous.



When exactly did the Church fight against demons?

Roland had flipped through the pitiful mystic knowledge of the Fourth Prince and found nothing relevant. Since the end of the Battle of Divine Will, the Church had established its headquarters in the north, resisting the demonic beasts that invaded from the Great Rift. Later, they simply constructed the magnificent stronghold city on the Hermes Plateau and called it the New Holy City. These two cities, one high and one low, were meant to combat demonic beasts, not demons. Besides, he had never even heard of the place name Taquila.



If these events were true, there was no reason for the Church to conceal them. The books recording the history of the Church detailed every significant victory against demonic beasts and witches as if they feared others would not know of their achievements. But fighting demons seemed to be a matter even more worthy of grandiose recording.



The last question was about the God's Punishment Army.

Clearly, this member of the Church did not wish to see the God's Punishment Army appear and had entrusted others to stop the person responsible for the experiment. It seemed they had succeeded? Roland only knew of the Church's Judgement Army and had never heard of the God's Punishment Army—of course, this did not exclude the possibility of the Fourth Prince's ignorance.



However, if they could really cultivate powerful warriors capable of directly confronting demons, it would only greatly strengthen the Church's power. So why did the author of the notes think that the God's Punishment Army would bring about destruction?

The incredulous points in the book should refer to these last two issues.



"Cara was led astray by an ancient book; do you know where she got it from?" Roland lifted his head to look at Nightingale.

"When I joined the Witch Cooperation Association, the sisters had already embarked on the path to seek the mountain," Nightingale, chewing on dried fish, spoke with a muffled voice, "But Wendy had mentioned that the Association wasn't initially called the Witch Cooperation Association. It was just a few witches who happened to come together in Seawindshire, including Cara, Wendy, and Scroll. Later, they found a secluded spot in the Eastern Region forest, not far from Seawindshire, to meet in secret. They didn't expect that it would actually be the entrance to an underground ruin." She swallowed the snack in her mouth and licked her lips, "But apart from Cara, no one else went down to explore."



"The ancient book was found in the ruins?"



"That's what Cara claimed anyway," Nightingale pouted. "After that, the number of witches gathering increased. Perhaps it was during one of the meetings that someone accidentally leaked their whereabouts, and the Church sent a large group of Witch Hunters to surround the forest. More than twenty witches were inside, but less than half managed to escape. It was from that time that Cara decided to head to the Impassable Mountain Range in search of the Holy Mountain. Thus, they called themselves the Witch Union and made finding the Holy Mountain the supreme goal for all members."



After listening, Roland fell into deep thought. Having allocated too few points to mysticism was proving to be quite troublesome; anything related to history and legend was virtually a blank in his mind. The ancient book did not mention specific years, and he was not sure whether other historical records had documented this war. The first person involved had already died. If only he could go to the ruins to investigate, he thought.



However, Roland also understood that this was nearly impossible. The Eastern Region forest was too far from him. Compared to embarking on a journey that would take him across the entire kingdom of Greycastle, developing his domain was his primary task.



Walking to the window, Roland looked down at the garden through the floor-to-ceiling windows. The witches were training their abilities as he had instructed. Now that he had twelve witches under his command, it was time to establish an organization.



In his vision, this organization did not require any manifesto or guidelines. It was set up to facilitate the management of witches and the rational use of their abilities, functioning similarly to a trade guild in later generations.



The rules of the organization were to be as simple as possible, only two: Do not use abilities to violate the laws of the territory. Do not use abilities to evade legal accountability.



Initially, Roland had thought to mimic the Three Laws of Robotics, restricting witches from using their powers to harm or attack ordinary people and the like, but later he felt it was really unnecessary. Their abilities were like guns in the hands of ordinary people. When faced with danger, there was no fundamental difference between fighting back with a gun and using abilities. Moreover, deliberately emphasizing the differences between witches and ordinary people would only widen the gap between the two groups.



Therefore, not breaking the law and not evading responsibility were the most concise expressions that a technical-minded person like him could think of.



As for the name of the organization, Roland had thought it through long ago.

This brand-new collective would be called the "Witch Union."
