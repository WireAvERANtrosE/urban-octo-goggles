## "The Key to Art"
"The Church seems to have popped up out of nowhere." Even after returning to his office, Roland's mind still echoed with these words.



He closed his eyes and carefully searched through the Fourth Prince's memories, but still couldn't find any more relevant information. His understanding of the Church was about the same as any ordinary noble—during his time in the palace, the Fourth Prince hardly spent any effort on acquiring knowledge, and his understanding of mysticism was almost a blank slate. However, if what Tilly said was true, then the Church's propaganda strategy was indeed very strange.



Taking the religious legends of his original world as an example, the notion that gods originated at the beginning of the world was child's play; the unanimously chosen routine was that the world was created by gods. For instance, the seven days of creation, the cycle of karma and reincarnation, and so on... A complete set of legends describing the might of gods was standard for every religion.



By comparison, the Church of this world seemed quite... naïve.



But Roland didn't have more clues to continue his research, so he shook his head and decided to put these thoughts aside for now.



Perhaps after exploring the ancient ruins of the Hidden Forest, all the answers would come to light.



He walked to the window pane and looked towards the garden, where a huge spread-out layer of coating lay flat on the ground—in the midst of the white, vast snow, its emerald green appearance was especially eye-catching.



Now, Soraya was working on bonding a larger airbag, and the new hot air balloon would be much larger, capable of carrying more people. This was in consideration of the possibility that if no way was found to rescue the trapped woman during the exploration of the ruins, then they would simply have Anna cut the entire "ice coffin" into pieces and bring her back to Border Town along with a portion of the transparent crystals.



The departure was set for two days later.



The personnel had already been arranged. From the Sleeping Island witches, there were Tilly, Sylvie, Scroll, Ashes, and Andrea. The Witch Union would send out Anna, Wendy, Nightingale, Nana, Lightning, and Maggie. This lineup was unprecedentedly strong, with attack, defense, and battlefield awareness all at the highest level. As long as they did not use the Divine Stone of Judgement, it would be very difficult for the devils to get close to them.



"Your Highness, the Chief Alchemist, Sir Kyle Sichi, wishes to see you," a guard said from outside the door.



"Let him in."



Kyle did not come alone this time; he brought his colleague, Chemist Jams, with him. "Your Highness, we have a lead on the mass production method for nitric acid that you requested."



"Really?" Roland was slightly taken aback, then a wave of joy surged in his heart. This was probably the best news he had heard in recent days. He excitedly stood up and personally poured a cup of tea for the two chemists, "Tell me, how is it made?"



"It's Jams's achievement," he said, stroking his beard with a smile, "Let him explain it to you."



"Your esteemed Highness," the young Jams appeared somewhat reserved, bowing before starting to speak, "Your alchemy workshop... no, the chemical laboratory produces nitric acid by distilling saltpeter to obtain dilute nitric acid, then purifying it with concentrated sulfuric acid. I tried combining the two processes, directly heating the saltpeter in concentrated sulfuric acid, and the result was a nitric acid solution with very high purity. We even observed the fuming phenomenon described in 'Elementary Chemistry.'"



"Co-heating? But that's not the same thing," Roland said curiously, "The temperature for dry distillation is much higher than that of co-heating, and the gas produced from dry distillation should be nitrogen oxides, which form dilute nitric acid when introduced into water. Purification with concentrated sulfuric acid is just to reduce the water content in the nitric acid by taking advantage of its high boiling point and hygroscopic nature, without involving a chemical reaction."



"I don't quite understand why either, but Mr. Stool did a few experiments afterward and thought that my discovery was a coincidence."

"A coincidence?" Roland looked at the Chief Alchemist.

"Indeed," Kyle affirmed. "The two are not equivalent, yet they produced the same effect. I deduced from the chemical formula and guessed that it must be some component in saltpeter reacting with sulfuric acid to produce nitric acid, which then evaporated when heated. According to the formula, it looks like some kind of... um, nitrate."

Suddenly, Roland recalled from his chemistry textbook that before the artificial synthesis of ammonia was invented, people used to react sodium nitrate or potassium nitrate with concentrated sulfuric acid to produce nitric acid, which is also the oldest industrial method. Since the main components of saltpeter are these two nitrates, which are convenient and easily obtained, nitric acid can be easily extracted by controlling the temperature and continuously collecting the evaporated nitric acid.

Of course, since this method consumes a large amount of sulfuric acid and easily corrodes equipment, it was quickly superseded by more advanced technologies.

However, these two issues were not a big problem for Roland. There was no established fertilizer and pesticide industry in his domain, and the sulfuric acid produced was solely for the purification of nitric acid. As for the strong corrosiveness of nitric acid vapor, it could be handled by Soraya's coatings.

"Well done," Roland said with pleasure, patting Chem's shoulder. "It's quite fortunate that you could come up with this method by chance."

"What you don't know is that he had already shown extraordinary luck back at the Redwater City alchemical workshop," Kyle Stool raised an eyebrow and said, "Before learning chemistry, alchemy itself was a kind of exploration that required luck, and this lad managed to figure out the double acid method in his early twenties, becoming the youngest alchemist in the workshop, making a bunch of thirty or forty-year-old apprentices green with envy. You know, they might remain apprentices for their entire lives."

"Anyway, this is good news for the town," Roland praised. "You guys first try to produce a batch of equipment and see how it goes. I'll have the witches cooperate with you. If it's feasible, then we can scale up production."



"As you wish."



"By the way, I have another task for you," he continued, his joyful demeanor replaced by a serious tone. "Now that we have a reliable source of nitric acid, next I need you to attempt the production of something very dangerous—nitroglycerin."



"How dangerous?" asked Camilla.



"The ingredients are simple: concentrated nitric acid reacts with glycerol, catalyzed by concentrated sulfuric acid. However, the temperature must be strictly controlled during the reaction, and ventilation must be maintained. Since a lot of heat is produced during nitration, you can try conducting the experiment in a container placed in ice water. Remember, sudden changes in temperature, vibration, impact, and friction can all cause it to explode." Roland did not know how reliable this amateur knowledge was, but the components were undoubtedly correct, and despite the risks, it was necessary to try. "When experimenting, just use a small amount of acid solution, so that even if an accident occurs, Miss Nana can rescue you."



"This..." Chemist looked agape, but before he could respond, Camilla had already agreed, "I understand. How does its power compare with blasting powder?"



"Worlds apart."



"It seems like it will be an interesting experiment," said the Chief Alchemist with a smile.



Nine out of ten chemists are potential explosives enthusiasts... Roland thought to himself.



Nitroglycerin is highly unstable. Nobel's safe explosives involved adding diatomaceous earth to desensitize the ester, which, although it made it safer, also reduced its explosive power. Of course, Roland wouldn't choose this classical method. He planned to add either nitrocellulose or nitrostarch to the nitroglycerin, both of which could stabilize it and further enhance the explosive effect. The former is an excellent smokeless propellant, while the latter is a powerful high explosive. From their names, it is clear that an abundant supply of nitric acid is the key to the evolution from black powder to chemical explosives.



And now, he already possessed this key.
