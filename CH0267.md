## Predestined Outcome
Passing through the dim corridor and descending into the vast cavern deep underground with the cage lift, Maine once again came before the Secret Holy Temple.

His Holiness, O'Brien, was already waiting at the entrance.

He looked even older than the last time, with sunken eye sockets and wrinkles at the corners of his eyes spreading across his cheeks like spiderwebs. Yet, his smile remained gentle, filled with concern. Maine couldn't help but feel a sting in his eyes and knelt before him, "Your Holiness, we—"

"Rise, child," the Pope's voice was steady and calm, "I've heard you've run into trouble? Let's talk in the hall."

Today wasn't a day of conversion, so the hall wasn't lit with long rows of candles flickering like stars along the base of the walls, only a few candelabras were placed in the corners. The Pope sat back in the main seat and took a breath, "Tell me, what exactly has happened outside?"

Maine knew well the weight of His Holiness O'Brien's responsibilities; it wasn't that he couldn't learn of the news from outside the Holy City, but that he had no time to attend to these trifles. That's why three Archbishops had been appointed to jointly manage church affairs. He should avoid troubling His Holiness with these matters as much as possible, but he was powerless to resolve the current troubling situation.

Maine quickly recounted the events from beginning to end.

"Heather is dead..." O'Brien remained silent for a long while after listening, then let out a long sigh, "A girl with keen observation, cleverness, and devoutness—I watched her grow up slowly."

"Please accept my condolences, Your Holiness."



"The murderer will certainly be punished," the Pope nodded, "The current situation is that Grace and the Kingdom of Wolfheart are supporting each other? Did the new poison not work?"

"It worked wonders during the siege of Tooth Castle. After the garrison held out for a month, they all died, and the Army of Judgment quickly entered the city. Hardly any living people could be seen in the residential areas. However, when we proceeded to attack Wolfheart City, the poison seemed to have lost its effect. The enemy's resistance is still stubborn," Mayne reported.

"You made two mistakes," O'Brien said slowly, "The disease caused by the poison will be fatal within seven to ten days. You should have launched an attack during the first peak of the outbreak, then quickly treat the city's residents. This would significantly reduce their hostility. Don't forget that what we need is as many people as possible, not empty cities."

"The second mistake was waiting for a month before taking action. Although it minimized casualties, it gave the enemy ample time to find a way to cure the disease. The essence of the new poison is demonic beasts, and according to the Holy Book of Demonic Energy, there are over seventy abilities that can resist its contagion, and more than thirty abilities can directly kill it. It's not surprising for a city of tens of thousands to have a witch with such abilities."

"Are you saying they colluded with a witch—"

"At the brink of life and death, who would care if they are the devil's minions," the Pope said calmly, "Regardless of whether this witch came forward on her own or was forced to reveal herself to treat the plague, it is not good news for the Church. If they really can hold back our offensive, the witch's reputation in Wolfheart is bound to undergo a radical change, even... being seen as a hero."

"All of this is my fault." Mayne lowered his head in sorrow.

"Indeed, it was a mistake, but not a grave one. You devised such a strategy to reduce the losses of the Army of Judgment and the God's Punishment Army," O'Brien tapped his shoulder with his scepter, "Moreover, the fact that the Third Princess of Greycastle and the Wolf King are gathered in one place also presents us with an opportunity."

"Op...portunity?" The bishop was taken aback.



"Exactly, the chance to capture them all in one fell swoop," O'Brien stood up, "Come with me."



Following the guide of the guards, Maine followed the Pope out of the Secret Chamber and slowly walked deeper into the cave. The huge Divine Stone of Judgement emitted a dim light, illuminating the path under their feet—gradually, the light grew dimmer, and Maine couldn't help but look back, only to see the Secret Holy Temple and the God's Stone had been left far behind. At this moment, the guards also lit torches to prevent tripping over the scattered rocks on the ground.



"Where are we going?"



"We have arrived, child," His Holiness O'Brien stopped, his breathing slightly hurried, "Huff... I'm old, and even such a short distance is exhausting..."



A guard came forward to support him, "Your Holiness, let me carry you."



"There's no need, I'll just rest a bit," he stood in place for a while, then ordered, "Light up the brazier."



It was then that the bishop noticed several towering iron racks standing beside the stone path, which were hard to detect by the average person unless the guards with torches approached them. A guard climbed up the ladder to the top of the rack and lit the resin basin, and instantly several dazzling flames burst forth. Maine squinted his eyes at first, and after getting used to the change in light, he looked forward.



In the flickering firelight, a dusty canvas appeared in front of everyone, bulging high, clearly covering a massive object underneath.



"I originally planned to use it to resist the increasingly fierce demonic beasts in the last two years, but now it seems we have to start it up early," O'Brien waved his hand, "Uncover the canvas."



"This is..." As the canvas fell, Maine couldn't believe his eyes. It was a huge, ferocious-looking iron vehicle with four wheels, each wheel taller than himself. It had no carriage, only a terrifying metal ram and a framework of beast bones, with a bone shield covered in barbs at the center, as large as three or four door panels. Two straight, pointed iron rods extended from the openings on the shield, one on the left and one on the right, pointing straight forward like arrows ready to be released. And on both sides of the iron vehicle, dozens of such iron rods were hung, each as thick as a thigh, reflecting a dim metallic luster under the brazier.



"The scriptures name it the 'Siege Beast,'" the Pope approached the iron vehicle and patted the sturdy iron rod, "It can only be started with magic and requires three or four witches to operate properly. The attack range of the Siege Beast far exceeds that of catapults and ballistae, and ordinary city walls can hardly withstand the destruction of its iron arrows. Wooden ships are like thin paper before it, whether it's destroying the strong walls of Wolfheart City or stopping the advance of the Black Sail Fleet, it does so with ease."



"Is this... also a weapon developed by the Secret Sanctuary?" 



"No," O'Brien shook his head, "You should be able to guess that it comes from our enemies—the devils from the depths of hell. That's why the Church has kept the Siege Beast hidden deep in the caves. Remember, when you use it, you must conceal its tracks as much as possible and not let the civilians see its form."



"I understand," Maine bowed his head.



Why could a weapon of the devils be controlled by witches? Did they possess the same magic as humans? He suppressed the doubts in his heart and did not ask further. Clearly, these were matters that he would only be privy to once he became the new Pope.



"Moreover, to prevent Grace and the Wolf King from escaping again, I will send two Purifiers to assist you in battle," the Pope said solemnly, "No one can escape their hunt... Go, and with the blood of these blasphemers, send off Hester."



Purifiers under the Pope's crown! His heart trembled. Witches nurtured and kept alive by the Church were called Purifiers, but the witches under the Pope were the strongest, carefully selected, their abilities not even recorded in the scriptures of magic power. They were completely different from Hester, Tefren, and the witches under his own command! Now that the Pope himself had said that escape was impossible, then the fate of the two was already sealed.



"By your will, Your Holiness," Maine responded excitedly.
