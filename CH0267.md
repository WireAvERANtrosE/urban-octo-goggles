## The Inevitable Conclusion
Passing through the dim corridor and taking the cage elevator deep underground, Maine came before the Secret Holy Temple once again.

Pope O'Brien was already waiting at the entrance.

He looked even older than last time, his eye sockets were sunken, and the wrinkles at the corners of his eyes spread across his cheeks like a spider web. Yet his smile remained gentle, filled with concern. Maine couldn't help but feel a sourness in his eyes and knelt before him, "Your Holiness, we—"

"Rise, child," the Pope's voice was calm and steady, "I heard you've encountered some trouble? Let's talk in the hall."

Today was not a day of conversion, and the hall had no candles lined up along the base of the walls like a string of stars; only a few candlesticks were placed in the corners. The Pope sat back in his main seat and took a breath. "Tell me, what exactly happened outside."

Maine was well aware of the heavy responsibilities of His Holiness Pope O'Brien. It wasn't that he couldn't be informed of the news outside the Holy City, but rather he had no time to deal with these trivial matters, thus three Archbishops were established to manage church affairs together. He should avoid troubling His Holiness with these issues as much as possible, but now he was powerless to resolve the present troubles.

Maine quickly recounted the events from beginning to end.

"Heather is dead..." Pope O'Brien was silent for a long time after listening and then let out a long sigh, "A girl with keen observation, clever and devout. I watched her grow up."

"Please accept my condolences, Your Holiness."



"The murderer will surely be punished," the Pope nodded, "Is the current situation that Grace and the Kingdom of Wolfheart are assisting each other? Did the new poison not work?"

"It worked wonders when we took over the Toothless Bastion. After the defenders held on for a month, they all perished, and the Judgement Army quickly invaded the city. Almost no living person was seen in the residential areas. However, when we subsequently attacked the Wolfheart City, the poison seemed to have no such effect. The enemy's resistance is still stubborn," Mayne reported.

"You have made two mistakes," Oberlin said slowly, "The disease caused by the poison leads to death within seven to ten days. You should have launched an attack during the first peak of the outbreak, and then quickly treated the city's residents, which would greatly reduce their hostility. Don't forget that what we need is as many people as possible, not a series of empty cities."

"The second mistake was waiting a month to take action. Although this minimized casualties, it gave the enemy ample time to react and find a cure for the disease. The essence of the new poison is demon-beasts, and according to the Holy Book of Divine Energy, there are more than seventy abilities that can inhibit its contagion, and over thirty abilities that can directly exterminate it. In a city of tens of thousands, it's not surprising for such a witch to appear."

"Are you saying they colluded with the witches—"

"When it comes to life and death, who cares whether they are the devil's minions or not," the Pope said calmly, "It doesn't matter whether this witch took the initiative to stand up or was exposed and had to treat the plague, it's bad news for the Church either way. If they really can withstand our offensive, the witches' reputation in Wolfheart will inevitably undergo a radical change, and they might even be seen as heroes."

"It's all my fault." Mayne lowered his head in sorrow.

"Indeed, it's a mistake, but not a severe one. You also formulated such a strategy to reduce the losses of the Judgement Army and the God's Punishment Army," Oberlin tapped his shoulder with his scepter, "Moreover, the opportunity of the three princesses of Greycastle and the Wolf King gathering in one place is also an opportunity for us."

"Op...portunity?" the Bishop was taken aback.



"Yes, the opportunity to catch them all in one net," said Archbishop Mayne as he stood up. "Follow me."



Guided by the guards, Mayne followed the Pope out of the Secret Chamber and slowly walked deeper into the cave. The massive God's Punishment Stone emitted a dim glow, illuminating the path beneath their feet—the light gradually dimmed, and Mayne couldn't help but look back, only to see the Secret Sanctuary and the God's Stone far behind them. At this point, the guards also lit torches to prevent stumbling over the scattered rocks on the ground.



"Where are we going?"



"We're here, child," Archbishop Mayne stopped, his breathing a bit labored, "Huff... I'm old, and even this little distance is so tiring..."



A guard stepped forward to support him, "Your Eminence, let me carry you."



"No need, I will be fine after a rest," he stood in place for a while, then instructed, "Light the brazier."



Only then did the bishop notice several tall iron frames standing beside the stone path. If the guards carrying torches didn't approach them, it would be difficult for anyone to notice these metal constructs hidden in the darkness. The guards climbed up the ladder to the top of the frame and lit the resin basin, and several dazzling flames burst forth. Mayne squinted his eyes at first, and after adjusting to the change in light, he looked ahead.



In the flickering firelight, a dust-covered canvas appeared in front of everyone, bulging high as if covering a huge object underneath.



"It was originally planned to be used in the last two years to resist the increasingly fierce demonic beasts, but now it seems we have to start it ahead of schedule." Archbishop Mayne waved his hand, "Uncover the canvas."



"This is..." As the canvas fell, Maine could not believe his own eyes. It was a gigantic, menacing four-wheeled iron carriage, with a single wheel taller than himself. It had no compartment, only a terrifying metal ram and a framework of beast bones, in the center of which was a bone shield covered in thorns, as large as three or four door panels. Two straight, pointed iron rods extended from the holes in the shield, one on the left and one on the right, pointing straight forward, like arrows ready to be loosed. And on either side of the iron carriage, dozens of such iron rods were hanging, each as thick as a man's thigh, reflecting a dull metallic luster under the firelight.



"The Scriptures have named it the 'Siege Beast,'" the Pope approached the iron carriage and patted the sturdy iron rod, "It can only be activated by magic power and requires three or four witches to operate properly. The attack range of the Siege Beast far exceeds that of trebuchets and ballistas, and ordinary city walls can hardly withstand the destruction of its iron bolts. Wooden ships built of huge timbers are like thin paper in front of it, whether it's destroying the solid walls of Wolfheart or halting the advance of the Black Sail Fleet, it's all effortless for it."



"Is this... also a weapon developed by the Holy See?" 



"No," O'Brien shook his head, "You should be able to guess, it comes from our enemy—the devil from the abyss of hell. This is also why the Church has hidden the Siege Beast deep in the caves. Remember, when you use it, you must hide your tracks as much as possible, and do not let the civilians see its form."



"I understand," Maine bowed his head.



Why can witches manipulate the weapons of the devil? Do they also possess magic power like humans? He suppressed the doubts in his heart and did not continue to ask. Clearly, these matters would only be understood once he became the new Pope.



"Additionally, to prevent Grace and the Wolf King from escaping again, I will send two Pures to assist you in battle," the Pope said solemnly. "No one can escape from their hunt... Go, let the blood of these blasphemers be a tribute to Heather."



The Pures under the Pope's command! His heart trembled; the witches raised by the Church and who had survived were called Pures, but the witches under the Pope's command were the strongest, selected from thousands, their abilities not even recorded in the Magic Scriptures, a far cry from Heather, Tefren, and the few under his own command! Now that His Holiness himself had said there was no escape, the fate of the two was already sealed.



"At your command, Your Holiness," Maine replied, excited.
