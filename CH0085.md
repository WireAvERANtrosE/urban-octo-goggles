## Thorny Road
The old man took a moment to react, then he slowly pushed the blanket aside and moved to the side of the bed, looking straight at the Archbishop.

"Would you be able to eat if you were locked up in this damned place?" he spoke, his voice hoarse and unclear, as if his throat was clogged with something, "Half a year, trapped here for half a year, without any news... How is my son, and my daughter?"

Mayne noticed that the walls were covered with scratches, seemingly made with fingernails. Was this the method the other party used to count the days?

He moved a stool and sat down facing the king, "Must you ask about these things that will only upset you?"

"..." The other party was silent for a long while, "I'm of no use anymore, you've come to end my life, haven't you?"

"Yes."

"Then what's the point in caring about whether I'm pleased or not! Before I die, I just want to know about their situation!" By the last sentence, Wimbledon's voice had turned into a near roar.

He couldn't hold back after all, Mayne thought. No matter what, as a king, his demeanor and grace were still fully intact. After being replaced by the Devouts and sent on the way to Hermes, he attempted to escape multiple times. Even while imprisoned here, he didn't fall into madness but instead tried to negotiate for his freedom. There was no cursing, no hysterical screaming, which was quite rare in the Agency's prison. If the plan could not be changed, he really did not wish to waste such a person in a conspiracy within the kingdom.

Perhaps coming here personally also carried the intention of informing him of the current situation, the Bishop thought. Otherwise, a single order would have sufficed for the Judgement Army to end his life for him.



"Your eldest son, Herman Wimbledon is dead," Mayne spoke slowly, "executed by beheading on the charge of treason and regicide by your second son, Timothy Wimbledon. Your third daughter, Grace Wimbledon, has declared independence in the Southern Territory and proclaimed herself Queen of Clearwater, making war with Timothy inevitable. As for the fourth son and fifth daughter, we haven't received much news. They are probably... still alive."



"What are you talking about, treason? Independence? What exactly have you done?"



"The King's Order," he said, word by word, "assigning your children to various lands, proclaiming that whoever can govern their territory the best will be the next monarch."



Wimbledon closed his eyes in agony. After a long while, he spoke in a low voice, "Why? You took advantage of the Day of Prayers to bring me into the compartment, stripped me of my clothes... and the God's Punishment Stone. You replaced me with someone else using a witch. You could have slowly taken over the country, had the church established in every town. Why issue the King's Order! I, I couldn't possibly..." His voice grew agitated, and Wimbledon hunched over, coughing violently.



"I couldn't possibly issue such an order that would cause my children to slaughter each other," right? Mayne thought to himself, finishing the king's sentence mentally, "Perhaps you wouldn't, but your children might not follow your wishes. They've grown up and developed their own ideas. For instance, your third daughter, Grace, received the port of Clearwater five years ago. Even without the King's Order, or say, when you pass away naturally, would she watch Herman ascend to the throne and do nothing? Most importantly, we don't have the luxury of time, as you should have noticed, the power of witches is not permanent."



"Damn it, what good does their infighting do for the Church? The church will be engulfed in flames, believers will die in the war, the kingdom will be in chaos..." Wimbledon suddenly paused, lifting his head in disbelief, "Could it be, you want to—" A severe bout of coughing cut him off, and when he finally recovered, his voice was thin as a thread, as if the coughing had drained all his energy, "You... want to eliminate the royal family."



"That's correct, but more precisely, the royal authority," Mayne couldn't help but praise inwardly, what acute judgment. "Royal authority hinders the development of the Church. No matter how weak it is, it will always grow like a sapling. Only by uprooting it completely can the Church 'truly' take over the kingdom."



Wimbledon's expression suddenly aged significantly. Perhaps before he only looked old on the outside, but now even his spirit had declined, the light in his eyes dimming.



"Greycastle is the largest kingdom on the continent, with abundant military resources, and a direct war would be disadvantageous for the Church. We have planned for this for a long time. Your kingdom will inevitably lose a great number of soldiers and mercenaries in a civil war. As long as it continues for two to three years, our Judgement Army will easily be able to take over the entirety of Greycastle. You need not be too sad, a dethroned monarch is not unique to you alone, the other three countries are the same. In the future, the continent will no longer be divided into four great kingdoms. Morning Light, Wolfheart, Everwinter, and Greycastle will all disappear. On this vast land, there will only be one authority, and that will be the Church."



Wimbledon fell silent, the man who had seized the throne from his brothers through force now seemed to have lost all vitality. Even Mayne felt a tinge of reluctance, yet he harbored no regrets in his heart. The Church had likewise paid a great price—many outstanding believers had willingly become pawns, throwing themselves into this grand scheme with reckless abandon.



The man playing the role of Wimbledon III was a devout Chief Judge from the Judgement Army, unwavering in his faith and absolutely loyal to the Church. He was originally destined to undergo the transformation ceremony of the God's Punishment Army. However, for the sake of the mission, he was replaced by a witch to take on the appearance of the king, and died dishonorably in the bedroom of the royal palace in Greycastle. His name could have been engraved on the monument in the Hermes Church, but now, the Church could only bury his name forever.



Mayne thought that Wimbledon would not speak again, and reached into his bosom for a small porcelain bottle, preparing to make him drink it. Unexpectedly, Wimbledon suddenly spoke, "Curse..."



"Hmm?"



"I curse you... I will be waiting for you in the depths of hell," his voice grew weaker and weaker, and Mayne had to concentrate to hear his words clearly.



"It's a pity, but this world does not have a hell. Even if it did, that place would not belong to us. Everything we do, we do for the sake of continuation. Only by unifying the four kingdoms can the Church gather the greatest strength to defeat the true enemy, otherwise..." The bishop stopped there, noticing that Wimbledon's hand had slipped powerlessly, his head tilted to one side, and the rise and fall of his chest had completely ceased.



This was the end of a king, but it marked a new beginning for us, he thought.



Mayne pocketed the porcelain bottle and stood up to leave. Pushing open the wooden door, the corridor was silent as though the cries had never existed. He gave a few instructions to the Judgement Army warrior guarding the door for the aftermath, then walked away without looking back, heading outside the mechanism.
