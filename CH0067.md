## Battle of Hermes (Part 2)
But the anticipated final battle did not happen.

One man walked up to the female warrior and pressed down on her sword hilt.

"Everyone step back." His voice was not loud, yet it was clear and forceful. Ashes noticed that he was one of the members of the group that still maintained an orderly formation; a commander's insignia was worn on his bracer. "The God's Punishment Army has arrived."

She turned her head and saw a troop of tall warriors emerging one after another from the North Gate. They were clad in gleaming full-body armor, which reflected a silvery sheen under the soaking rain, and their backs were draped with crimson red cloaks. The weapons in their hands varied; some held shield and sword, others wielded scythes or iron axes. After crossing the drawbridge, they did not reform their ranks but scattered, heading straight towards the charging demonic beasts.

What kind of tactic is this? It's simply reckless! Facing hybrid demonic beasts whose strength and speed far exceed that of humans, the only way to win is to maintain formation and confront the enemy with the combined power of many. What are they doing now, trying to fight individually? And moreover, they are letting the God's Punishment Army fight alone while they just watch from the side?

"We must go and support them!"

"No need," the man shook his head, his complexion somewhat somber. "We just need to watch; rushing in rashly will only hold them back."

Hold them back? Ashes glared at him angrily, had she misjudged him, thinking he was just a coward afraid of death? She tightened her grip on the sword hilt, ready to bypass him and join the fight—although she was filled with uncertainty about the future of the New Holy City, at this moment facing the enemy, all she could do was to die in battle.

But before she could take two steps, the female warrior witnessed a scene that was beyond belief.



A flying demonic beast swooped down from the sky, its appearance as terrifying as a messenger from hell, with huge wings covered in gray feathers that spanned twelve feet when fully extended. Its head was like that of a bird, yet it bore a pair of goat horns, and the hooks on its claws were enough to slice into a knight's breastplate.



Plummeting vertically from the sky was their favored method of attack, stealthy and extremely difficult to defend against. Even if one wielded a heavy shield with both hands, they would be knocked down by the force, the tremendous impact shattering the arm bones of the one holding the shield and crushing their chest cavity, creating a situation with almost certain death. The only way to counter it was to roll away at the moment the demonic beast was about to hit the ground, which might allow one to dodge the dangerous strike.



But the God's Punishment Army did not dodge. A knight in silver armor took up a stance to face the enemy head-on, and at the moment the beast pounced in front of him, he stretched out his hands and met the creature's paw pads with his palms, producing a sound as loud as the roaring of the Snow Reflection Barrel. A mist rose from him and the monster, and a creaking noise came from the twisting of his armor.



His right leg bent, his left leg stretched out, and his body tensed into a straight line pointing to the sky, and for a moment, the demonic beast could not overwhelm him. Another knight targeted this struggling flying beast and threw a short javelin with such speed that Ashes only saw a flash of silver light before the javelin accurately penetrated the creature's skull, shattering it.



The silver-armored knight threw the still-twitching corpse of the demonic beast to the ground, his arm bent unnaturally, clearly having suffered a fracture from the earlier collision. Yet, as if nothing had happened, he drew an ax from his waist and charged at the other demonic animals.



To confront these monsters with mere human strength, Ashes could hardly believe her eyes. Hundreds of knights from the God's Punishment Army rushed into the swarm of demonic animals, their red capes like a torrent of blood that forcibly halted the enemy's advance. She now understood what the captain meant by "hindrance"; these knights were completely capable of fighting ten enemies each, their strength, agility, and reaction speed comparable to, if not stronger than, mixed demonic beasts. Ordinary demonic animals were almost powerless in front of them.



"This is amazing!" Ashes felt a sincere joy. With this group of brave and powerful knights, the Hermes Cathedral was unlikely to fall. "Ah, right, I haven't asked for your name yet. My name is Ashes Quinn, leader of the Judgment Army. It seems you already know about the combat capabilities of the God's Punishment Army?"



The other party glanced at her with a look as cold as sleet, without revealing his name, and simply said in a deep voice, "My elder brother is a member of the God's Punishment Army."

...



"It looks like we've won," Bishop Mayne said, holding a telescope at the top of the cathedral. This was the highest point in the New Holy City. Using the looking glass of the fjord merchants, one could overlook most of the battlefield. "Let's stop the trebuchets. The God's Punishment Army is about to take the city walls."



"Isn't victory expected?" another person spoke. He wore the same golden bishop's robes as Mayne, but his voice was much older. "The key point is, the armies of the four major kingdoms are finished."



"That's right, with this, their border defenses are practically non-existent," the last person said. She appeared the youngest of the three, barely over thirty, and was the only woman among the three Archbishops. "More than five thousand well-equipped, well-trained standing troops and nearly a thousand knights, even if they were immediately replenished, would require four to five years. Hmm..." She moaned, smacking her lips, "What a brilliant and devastating strategy."



"But to achieve this goal, we've also lost many of the Judgement Army, the backbone of the Church," Mayne sighed. "If it weren't for the fact that this plan could achieve results the fastest, I really wouldn't want to throw them into this hell."



"We have no other choice," the old man stroked his beard. "The desert beasts have appeared, just as recorded in the holy book, time is running out. If we can't unite the entire continent and concentrate our forces, all that awaits us is destruction."



"Destruction isn't necessarily a bad thing," the woman said with a frivolous laugh. "Humans are greedy, vicious, and driven by profit, doing things under the banner of justice that are more appalling than any demonic beast. Perhaps the devils of hell are much kinder than us."



"Heather!" the old man trembled with anger, "Such talk is utterly blasphemous. Do you wish to defy God's will?"



"You needn't worry about that, Lord Tavolin," Heather shrugged, her face indifferent. "I am the one in charge of the Tribunal, not you. Besides, did God ever demand that we survive? How do you know His Holiness wouldn't favor the devils more?"



"Enough! Tilly, Heather!" Mayne said displeasedly, "That's it for today. Later, I will report the situation to the Pope. You two go and attend to your respective duties."

...

After the two left, Mayne stood in front of the floor-to-ceiling window, looking towards the north—beyond the broken ridge of the Impassable Mountain Range lay the perennially snow-covered lands of the Land of Eternal Winter, and further to the west was the Barbarian Land. That was where everything began.



He knew that Bishop Tayfun was right; God's Punishment Warriors were too rare, requiring individuals who were utterly loyal to the Church, and at the same time, possessed strong willpower for the transformation. The Church had accumulated this force of less than a thousand men over nearly a century. To confront the demons, their numbers were still far from sufficient.



But the entire north could only provide so many of the God’s Punishment Army, and to wish for more warriors, there was no other choice but to unify the continent.



Of course, Bishop Heather was also correct. As a Church's Arbitrator, she had judged tens of thousands of evildoers and witches. Whether they were evildoers or witches, even the most brutal of them did not kill as many as were deliberately sacrificed in today's Pyrrhic victory.



The higher one's position in the Church, the clearer it became that God did not distinguish between good and evil, nor between righteousness and wickedness.

"How do you know He wouldn't favor the devils more?" Thinking of Heather's words, Mayne couldn't help but laugh. Probably only she could leave Lord Tayfun speechless. He thought, but God neither shelters mankind nor cares for devils.

It only favors the side that wins.
