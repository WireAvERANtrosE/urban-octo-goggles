## Return to Hometown
Logically, having left my family, I should not have returned to Silt's domain, but it wasn't to resolve my own doubts... it was for my father.

After that banquet, Sir Silt spoke not only of the woman in the painting but also seemed very sentimental. He said that the family existed because of her benevolence, but the generation of our grandfathers failed her kindness. At that time, I couldn't understand these words, but my father's demeanor is etched in my memory—it was a regret for the actions of the generation of our grandfathers.

If it was regret, could there still be a chance to make amends? Perhaps this woman I've seen is the descendant of the family's founder.

After all, my departure from the family was because I didn't want to be separated from Irene. As the eldest son, the family could not accept me officially marrying a commoner. It was merely a difference in choices, not a wrongdoing by the Silt family towards me.

After marrying Irene, Sir Silt, although he never visited me once, my mother still sent some daily necessities and a letter through someone, telling me that my father had forgiven me.

It was for these reasons that I decided to bring news to my family.

Due to the influence of the Evil Months, the ships traveling between the two places had significantly decreased, and it took me three days to wait for a merchant ship from the fortress. Including the time for unloading and inventory, it took a week to arrive at Longsong Stronghold.

Stepping off the dock, I immediately felt the desolation of the city. The snow on the ground was ankle-deep, and aside from a few alleys with varying depths of footprints, the snow on the streets was flat and untouched, indicating that it had been a long time since anyone had passed through. Compared to the bustling Border Town, it was hard to believe that this was the largest city in the Western Territory.

The Silt family's domain was right to the north of the stronghold, a village of nearly two thousand acres. If the stronghold looked like this, the village was even worse off. Walking towards the residence along the ruts of the carriage, I could see some starved corpses along the way—the early heavy snow that began in autumn caught most of the poor unprepared, with neither enough food nor firewood stored, and perhaps half of them would not survive until the next spring. Normally, this would be a common occurrence during the Evil Months, yet I found it somewhat difficult to grow accustomed to.



Passing by a few sparse wooden houses, Phyllin returned to his family's doorstep after many years.

The iron gate of the courtyard was tightly closed, and the front yard was covered with snow, but a few stone paths had been cleared, indicating that someone in the family was still taking care of the estate.

He knocked hard on the iron gate, and before long, two guards came out of the mansion. One of them quickly recognized Phyllin's identity, his face showing surprise as he said, "You, you are... the eldest young master."

"I would like to see Sir Silt." Phyllin said calmly.

Although everyone in the mansion knew that Dawnlight had severed ties with the family, this was after all a matter among nobles, and the guards did not dare to make their own decisions. They quickly opened the iron gate, one leading him to the hall to wait, and the other went to inform the butler.

Phyllin did not expect that the first to come would be his younger brother, Miso Silt.

"You no longer belong here, why have you come back?" He frowned and sized up his brother, "Did you walk here? Where are your followers?"

"I am no longer a knight," Phyllin smiled, "naturally, I would not have any followers accompanying me."

"Ah, I almost forgot, you were beaten by the Prince of Border Town and turned into his prisoner. He let you come back?" Miso snorted, "Is it because you have no money to survive the winter? I can give you some, then you just leave on your own accord."



The other party's attitude made Phyllis sigh. His reaction was not hard to understand—Miso Silt had now become the first heir of the family and naturally did not want him to come back and complicate things.

"I am not here for money, and I have no intention of contesting the position of heir with you," Dawnen said gravely, "His Highness the Prince has hired me as a tutor, and I am quite satisfied with my life now."

"A tutor?" Miso was taken aback, "I don't recall you having such profound knowledge to be able to instruct other nobles."

"Not teaching nobles, but teaching commoners to read and write."

"Teaching commoners..." He sneered, "Your lies are getting more and more interesting. Have you been bewitched by that commoner wife of yours?"

"Enough!" A low shout came from behind, causing Miso to shiver. Phyllis looked towards the voice and saw that it was none other than his father, Sir Silt. "Lady Irene is no less than any noblewoman; she only lacks a title. It would be rude of you to continue in this manner."

"Father!" Miso called out in a raised voice.

The knight ignored his younger son, "I heard from the guard that you have some news to tell me?"

"Yes," Phyllis bowed.



"Then come to my study."

...

Phyllis followed his father to the study on the second floor of the mansion. Passing through the hall, he took the opportunity to glance at the wall adorned with portraits, and the visage of the blue-haired woman appeared before him again—almost identical to the person he had seen in the convenience market. Unlike the other portraits, this one was particularly vibrant in color and much more exquisite in detail; even the teardrop mole at the corner of her eye was discernible.



Entering the study, the knight spoke first, "During the autumn theater performance, I saw your wife. She looked very well, and her acting did not pale in comparison to Miss May. It seems you two are doing quite well."



Phyllis suddenly felt a warmth in his eyes. He had not expected his father to bring this up first. After a moment of silence, he nodded, "Yes, we have our own home in Border Town, and we plan to have a child after the Evil Months end this year."



"That's good to hear," Sir Sichi slowly sipped his tea. "It must not be easy coming from Border Town nowadays. What news did you want to share?"



Dawnlight reined in his emotions, "I encountered a woman in the town who looks exactly like the person in the portrait in the hall."



The knight's hand trembled, nearly spilling his tea, as he looked up with widened eyes, "What did you say?"



"Rare blue hair, a beautiful appearance, I'm certain I was not mistaken," Phyllis said. "Could she be a descendant of the person in the painting?"



"Impossible! That person is—" he paused, then shook his head, "She couldn't possibly have any descendants."

"Is... that so?" Phyllis lowered her head, "Then perhaps I was mistaken."

"Did you come all this way to Longsong Stronghold just for this matter?"

"Yes, because I remember you once... expressed regret."

Sir Sichi pondered for a moment, "Really the same?"

"Except for the length of her hair being slightly different..." Phyllis recalled, "Every other aspect is exactly the same. You know, from birth until now, I've only seen such hair color in portraits, so I paid extra attention to it."

"It's impossible for her to be that person's descendant," the knight hesitated, "But she might be the person in the painting herself."

Phyllis could hardly believe his own ears at his father's words; the thought was even more incredible than his own speculation, "Herself? Do you mean... she has lived for more than four hundred years?"

"I did not wish to tell you this," he stood up and said, "She is a witch. Since she is a witch, anything is possible. Come with me."



"Where to?"

"The basement, I have something I want to show you," the nobleman said word by word, "a legacy from the ancestors, also a 'relic' left by her."
