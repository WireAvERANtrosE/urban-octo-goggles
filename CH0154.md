## Alchemy (Part 2)
When Kamo Strue returned home, it was already completely dark.

After dinner with his family, he returned to his study and wrote down the formula for crystal glass materials and his experience with selection into his work - "The Gate of Alchemy". The book recorded his journey from an apprentice to the chief alchemist, and it also included all the alchemical formulas summarized by the Redwater City Alchemy Workshop over the years.

Kamo believed that with this book, he would make his mark on history, and even after hundreds of years, alchemists would remember his name.

It was not until the candle flame neared the base that Kamo put down his quill, ready to undress and sleep.

Suddenly, he remembered that there was an unopened letter from the prince. Glancing at the candle, which was only as long as a fingernail, he decided to use the last bit of light to finish reading the letter and reply verbally to the messenger tomorrow - the stub of the candle would only allow him to write a few dozen words, but it was enough to read a worthless letter.

He opened the envelope, which contained three thin sheets of paper. The first page was filled with common pleasantries, introducing his title and domain. Kamo was even too lazy to read it and skipped directly to the second page.

The content on the second page surprised him; it was neither a recruitment nor a reprimand but a series of odd formulas. Upon closer inspection, he saw that each line of formulas consisted of three sentences.

Heh, this is somewhat interesting, he thought with a smile, setting aside what the prince's purpose might be, at least he knew how to be mysterious.

He scanned the first line of the equations.
"Distillation of saltpeter produces nitric acid."
Saltpeter... distillation... acid, these were all alchemical terms. Wait, Kaim suddenly felt a jolt in his heart, wasn't this one of the methods used in the alchemy workshop for the double-stone acid-making process?
The acid liquid distilled from saltpeter had to be collected through a special apparatus, appearing no different from ordinary steam and hardly noticeable. However, its corrosiveness was extremely powerful, capable of eroding skin and even dissolving some metals.
This... was actually an alchemical formula? Could it be that Border Town also had an alchemist?
His gaze quickly moved to the next line—
If the first sentence surprised him greatly, the second was utterly inconceivable.
It was made up of a bunch of incomprehensible symbols, arranged side by side, forming two equations. Kaim frowned; he had never seen such bizarre symbols before.
Further down, the third sentence seemed to be an explanation of the second, including the names and meanings of those symbols—truth be told, after reading it, he was still unable to understand. Those awkward terms seemed like fabrications, and he needed to read them over and over again to associate the words with the symbols. Despite that, the meaning of the entire sentence still eluded him.

Just then, the flame of the candle flickered twice and went out.
Damn it! Kyle cursed silently, not hesitating to take out a candle from the drawer and light it again.
...
By the time the second candle had burned halfway, the hands of the Chief Alchemist holding the letter were slightly trembling.
The seemingly inconsequential letter had taken him several times longer to read than normal.
The five formulas on the second page of the letter were all alchemical formulas!
If that had been all, it would have been one thing. An outstanding alchemist could imagine deriving five formulas through personal effort. However, these five formulas, apart from the first acid production method, were all interrelated. Certain coined words appeared repeatedly, forming what seemed to be a balanced cycle.
"Silver reacts with nitric acid to form silver nitrate, water, and nitric oxide."
"Silver nitrate reacts with iron to produce ferrous nitrate and silver."

"Silver nitrate reacts with copper to form copper nitrate and silver."
"Copper nitrate reacts with iron to produce ferrous nitrate and copper."
He had also performed the alchemical reaction of placing a silver rod in acid, where part of the silver rod was clearly dissolved by the acid, disappearing into nothingness—this was the very characteristic of acid, corroding everything. Yet the master had insisted, claiming that because silver nitrate is soluble in water, it only seems to disappear from the surface, when in fact, the silver merely exists in another form, rather than being annihilated.

How could that be possible?
No... Kamo shook his head, realizing that the other party had also anticipated his thoughts. These formulas echoing each other was not a coincidence; he realized that he was being given an opportunity to verify it himself—whether it was silver, iron, or copper, all were common minerals. If he were to conduct alchemy according to the subsequent formulas, the silver could be displaced again, proving that it had not been annihilated but still existed within the acid solution.

Looking at the neatly arranged formulas on the paper, he found his breathing becoming difficult—if all these alchemical formulas could stand, then his many years of accumulated experience, the efforts of his peers, and the "Alchemical Door" he was writing would all be nothing but a joke!

"You and the child go to sleep; I'm going to the Alchemy Workshop!"
Ignoring his wife's surprised look, Kamo put on his coat and rushed into the night.

Upon reaching the Alchemy Workshop, he immediately summoned three assistant disciples and informed them that he was about to conduct an alchemical experiment, instructing them to light as many torches and candles as possible. The orders were swiftly carried out, and his long table was brightly illuminated by the flames. The disciples moved between the material storage room and the extraction room, preparing experimental materials for their Chief Alchemist.

There was still plenty of acid left from the dry distillation of saltpeter, and the verification could start directly from the second equation.
He took some of the acid solution and poured it into a glass beaker, then placed a silver rod into it. As the reaction began, the rod was gradually corroded, and bubbles emerged.
While anxiously waiting, Kemo casually unfolded the third page of the letter.
There was only a short sentence written: "I have only done a little bit of work; if you want to know more answers, come to Border Town."
Damn it, this sentence might as well not have been written! If the claims on the letter could be verified, he would have to meet this unheard-of alchemy master no matter what. Otherwise, he would be restless in the days to come.
Only when the bubbles ceased to emerge did he remove the damaged silver rod and put a small piece of copper into the beaker.
Something unbelievable happened—the surface of the copper piece quickly showed specks of white, like the shell of a ladybug. The white spots expanded, slowly covering the entire copper piece, and the acid in the beaker turned from colorless to blue.
It was exactly as described in the letter!
"The white precipitate is silver, and the newly formed substance, copper nitrate, is as soluble in water as silver nitrate, but its solution is blue."

Kamol Stewart stared blankly at the result in his cup, standing motionless.

...

The next morning, when Chemis arrived at the Alchemy Workshop, he was startled by the sight of the Chief Alchemist, with dark circles under his eyes and a haggard face.
"Didn't you sleep at all last night?" he exclaimed in surprise, "For the second batch of crystal glass?"
Kamol shook his head, pulled Chemis to the long table, and asked wearily, "You were once my proudest disciple, I want to ask you, what do you think about alchemy?"
"Uh... just as you taught me," he noticed some glass cups on the table, a few of which contained solutions of different colors, one particularly eye-catching in sky blue. Could this be the reason the Chief spent all night awake? Although puzzled, Chemis replied honestly, "I empathize, the essence of alchemy is to seek the truth of the world amidst disorder and chaos..."
"No, no, no, Chemis, I was wrong," Kamol interrupted, "Everyone was wrong, alchemy is not like that."
Not like that...? Chemis felt that the other party was acting strangely, first staying up all night to perform alchemy, and now asking some inexplicable questions. But before he could ask further, the Chief was already speaking, "Alchemy is more orderly than we imagine, it can even be said to be rigid—like one plus one equals two, no matter how it changes, matter will not increase or disappear."
"Not increase or disappear? What are you talking about? The screening and combining of common materials to create incredible new things, isn't that what alchemists do?" he asked, not understanding.

"Yes, I once thought the same, until the lord of Border Town wrote me a letter..." Kaimo S. patted his shoulder, the words from his mouth sending a shock through Chames' heart, "I will soon leave this place to seek answers in Border Town. Would you... be willing to go with me?"
