## Alchemical (Part 2)
Kyle Sichi returned home to find that the sky had already turned pitch black.



After having dinner with his family, he returned to his study to write down the formula for the raw materials of crystal glass and his insights on material selection into his work—"The Gate of Alchemy." The book chronicled his journey from an apprentice to a Chief Alchemist and included all the alchemical formulas summarized over the years by the alchemy workshop in Redwater City.



Kyle believed that with this book, his name would go down in history, and even after hundreds of years, alchemists would remember him dearly.



It was not until the candle flame neared the base that Kyle put down his quill and prepared to undress for bed.



Suddenly, he remembered that he had yet to open a letter from the prince. Glancing at the candle that was no more than the length of a fingernail, he decided to use the last bit of time to finish reading this letter and verbally reply to the messenger tomorrow—a small stub of a candle was barely enough for him to write a few dozen words but was sufficient to read a letter of no value.



Upon opening the envelope, there were three thin sheets of paper inside. The first page contained the usual pleasantries, stating his own title and territory, which Kyle could not even be bothered to read and skipped directly to the second page.



The content on the second page took him by surprise. It was neither a recruitment nor a reprimand, but rather a series of strange formulas, with each line consisting of three sentences upon closer inspection.



Heh, this is somewhat interesting, he chuckled to himself. Regardless of the prince's intentions, at the very least, he knew how to be mysterious.



He scanned over the first line of the formula.

"Niter is dry distilled to produce nitric acid."

Niter... dry distillation... acid, these were all alchemical terms. Wait a minute, Kyle suddenly felt a jolt in his heart, wasn't this one of the methods for producing acid in the alchemy workshop, the so-called dual-stone method?

The acid liquid produced from dry distillation of niter had to be collected in a special container, it looked no different from ordinary water vapor and was hard to attract attention. But its corrosiveness was very strong, not only could it erode the skin, but it could even dissolve some metals.

This... Is this actually an alchemical formula? Could it be that Border Town now also has an alchemist?

He quickly moved his gaze to the next line—

If the first sentence surprised him greatly, the second one was simply inconceivable.

It was made up of a bunch of inexplicable symbols, with symbols lined up together, forming two equations. Kyle furrowed his brows; he had never seen such strange symbols before.

Further down, the third sentence seemed to be an explanation of the second, including the names and meanings of those symbols—honestly, after reading it, he still couldn't understand it. Those awkward words seemed to be made-up terms; he needed to read them over and over again to be able to associate the terms with the symbols. Despite this, the overall meaning of the sentence still eluded him.



Just then, the flame of the candle flickered twice and went out.

Damn it! Kyle cursed silently, without hesitation he took out a candle from the drawer and relit it.

...

As the second candle burned halfway, the chief alchemist's hands holding the letter were trembling slightly.

The seemingly inconsequential letter had taken him several times longer to read than usual.

The five formulas on the second page of the letter were all alchemy formulas!

If that were all, it would be fine. It was not unimaginable for an outstanding alchemy master to summarize five formulas on his own. However, these five formulas, apart from the first acid-making process, were all interrelated. Certain coined words appeared repeatedly, forming what seemed to be a balanced cycle.

"Silver reacts with nitric acid to form silver nitrate, water, and nitric oxide."

"Silver nitrate reacts with iron to form ferrous nitrate and silver."



"Silver nitrate reacts with copper to produce copper nitrate and silver."

"Copper nitrate reacts with iron to produce ferrous nitrate and copper."

He had also conducted the alchemical reaction of placing a silver rod in acid, part of which was clearly dissolved by the acid, disappearing into nothingness—this was precisely the characteristic of acid, corroding all things. However, His Excellency was adamant in saying that because silver nitrate is soluble in water, it seemed to disappear on the surface, but in reality, the silver still exists in another form, rather than being annihilated.

How is that possible?

No... Kyle shook his head, realizing that the other party had also anticipated his thoughts. These formulas were not coincidentally echoing each other; he realized that he was being given an opportunity to verify it—whether it was silver, iron, or copper, all were common minerals. If he followed the subsequent formulas to conduct alchemy, those silvers could be displaced again, to prove that they were not annihilated but still existed in the acid solution.

Looking at the neatly arranged formulas on the paper, he found it difficult to breathe—if all these alchemical formulas could be established, then the experience he had accumulated over the years, the efforts of his peers, and the "Gate of Alchemy" he was writing would all just be a joke!

"Go to sleep with the child, I'm going to the alchemy workshop!"

Ignoring his wife's surprised look, Kyle donned his coat and rushed into the night.

Upon arrival at the alchemy workshop, he immediately summoned three apprentice alchemists on duty and informed them that he was going to conduct an alchemical experiment, instructing them to light as many torches and candles as possible. The orders were quickly carried out, and his long work table was brightly illuminated by the firelight. The apprentices moved back and forth between the materials room, the warehouse, and the refining room, preparing experimental materials for the Chief Alchemist.



The acid distilled from saltpeter still had plenty left, so the verification could start directly from the second equation.

He poured some acid into a glass, then added a silver rod. As the reaction commenced, the rod gradually corroded, and bubbles started to emerge.

During the anxious wait, Kyle casually unfolded the third page of the letter.

It contained only a short sentence: "I have only done a little work; if you want to know more answers, come to Border Town."

Damn it, this sentence might as well have not been written! If what was written on the paper could be verified, he would have to meet this obscure alchemist no matter what. Otherwise, he would be restless for the rest of his days.

Only when the bubbles ceased to emerge did he remove the remnants of the silver rod and place a small piece of copper into the cup.

Something unbelievable happened—the surface of the copper quickly developed specks of white, like the shell of a ladybug. The white spots expanded, slowly covering the entire piece of copper, while the acid in the cup turned from colorless to blue.

It was exactly as described in the letter!

"The white precipitate is silver, and the newly formed substance, copper nitrate, is as soluble in water as silver nitrate, but its solution is blue."



Kyle Sichi stood motionless, staring at the result in his cup.

...

The next morning, when Chemist arrived at the Alchemy Workshop, he was startled by the sight of the Chief Alchemist with dark circles under his eyes and a haggard face.

"Did you not sleep at all last night?" he asked in surprise, "Because of the second batch of crystal glass?"

Kyle shook his head, pulled Chemist over to the long table, and asked wearily, "You were once my proudest disciple. I want to ask you, what do you think about alchemy?"

"Uh... just as you taught me," he replied, noticing several glass cups on the table containing solutions of various colors. Among them, a sky-blue solution was particularly eye-catching. Could this be the reason why the Chief had stayed up all night? Although Chemist was full of confusion, he still answered honestly, "I empathize with you. The essence of alchemy is to seek the truth of the world amidst disorder and chaos..."

"No, no, no, Chemist, I was wrong," Kyle interrupted, "Everyone is wrong. Alchemy is not like that."

Not like that...? Chemist felt that the Chief was acting strangely, first staying up all night alchemizing, and now asking these inexplicable questions. But before he could ask further, the Chief continued, "Alchemy is more orderly than you or I could ever imagine, even rigid—like one plus one equals two. No matter how it changes, matter will neither increase nor disappear."

"Neither increase nor disappear? What are you talking about? Sifting and combining common materials to create unbelievable new things, isn't that what alchemists commonly do?" he asked, puzzled.



"Yes, I used to think so too, until the lord of Border Town wrote me a letter..." Kyle Sichi patted his shoulder, the words from his mouth, however, sent a tremor through Chemis' heart, "I'll be leaving here soon to seek answers in Border Town. Would you... be willing to go with me?"
