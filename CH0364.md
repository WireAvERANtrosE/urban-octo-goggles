## Shadow Duplicate
The snow outside the window grew heavier, with nail-sized snowflakes scattering from the sky. Looking out, the air above the town was filled with their figures. The grey-white elves danced with the wind, densely falling towards the earth, blending with the white rooftops and tree branches, a sight that would make anyone feel the cold.

Yet the colder it was, the warmer Tilly felt.

She leaned back in her recliner, half her body covered with a soft blanket, her feet tucked into a brazier—a convenient heating device invented by Roland Wimbledon. The square wooden barrel was level with the chair, with a charcoal basin placed inside, separated by a horizontal wooden grille. It wasn’t like a blazing bonfire where one could easily get burnt if too close or feel little warmth if too far away. Just by resting one's feet on the wooden grille, one could enjoy the warmth of the charcoal fire up close. With a blanket draped over, the entire body seemed to be enveloped in warmth.

The heavy snowfall outside only highlighted the coziness within the room, creating a sense of happiness by contrast that left a lasting impression.

It had to be said that the treatment the witches received here was worlds apart from a year ago, and it wasn't hard to understand why no one wanted to leave the town once they arrived. Even she herself was particularly enjoying this moment.

Besides her, the room also contained Anna and Agatha—this was originally Anna's bedroom, but taking advantage of the rare leisure time, Tilly would bring books and seek guidance from her whenever she could. Initially, it was just the two of them, but now there was an additional ancient witch who had awakened from the ruins. Anna simply moved the brazier from beside the table to the open space in the room and had Roland add two more recliners. The three of them sat around the brazier, feet touching each other, collectively studying the eye-opening and novel knowledge.

Of course, more often than not, it was them asking and Anna answering.

“It's hard to believe that such books were actually written by mortals,” Agatha closed the 'Fundamentals of Natural Science' and took a deep breath, “The more I read, the more it seems that the world might truly be this way, that amidst all chaos there lies order, and that all things follow the same rule in their operation. Even if he had been born in Taquila, the Union would have surely included him within their ranks, and he might even hold a status equal to that of a high-ranking witch.”



At first, she had many doubts about the contents of the book, but with Anna's careful explanations, Agatha's attitude towards Roland had greatly changed.

However, Tilly believed that this change was only directed at Roland, and that other mortals probably still seemed foolish and slow to them.

Thinking of this, she couldn't help but sigh. Only she knew that this knowledge did not belong to Roland Wimbledon, but to another person, someone who had suddenly appeared in his mind.

After spending these days together and with Sylvie's corroboration, Tilly was fairly certain of this assertion. But this made proving that he was still himself an impossible task. Moreover, the most dubious point was, did he really not know where this part of the memory came from, to whom it belonged? It was hard to believe that memories could be completely severed from one's life experiences, at least she herself could not do it. Whenever she recalled the knowledge taught by the court tutor in her mind, she would always see flashes of related scenes from that time.

"Where on earth did he learn all this knowledge?" Agatha exclaimed. "I thought mortal research had reached such depth, but observing these past few days, it seems there is not much difference from four hundred years ago—even somewhat behind."

"I don't know either," Tilly shrugged. "Certainly not from the palace."

"What kind of person was he before?"

This question also made Anna look up.

"Before..." Tilly pondered for a moment, "arrogant and cowardly, willful, ignorant, with a terrible personality... Probably the only good thing was that he never did anything outrageously evil with his prince's identity."



"Uh... a mortal's level, huh?"

"No, even among mortals, he's a bad sort," she complained, "Even after coming here and suddenly improving, it's still hard to figure out what he's thinking... Keeping everything bottled up inside and still expecting others to trust him, how is that possible?"



The room suddenly fell silent.



"What's wrong?" Tilly sensed that their gazes were somewhat peculiar.



"No... it's nothing," Anna said, covering her mouth with a chuckle, "It's just that it's the first time I've heard you talk like this."



Damn, Tilly realized she had spoken too much. Such complaints shouldn't come from an ally; perhaps she had been too relaxed recently. "What I mean is—"



"It's alright, His Highness won't mind such things," Anna said with a shake of her head and a smile, "Perhaps he has his own difficulties."



"Roland..." Tilly hesitated, "Hasn't he mentioned these things to you?"



"No," Anna said nonchalantly, "I haven't asked either. If he wants to talk about it, he'll bring it up eventually."



Indeed, she sighed internally. For the other party, from the first moment they saw the prince, it was already the changed Roland, so pondering such questions was utterly meaningless.

"From what you're saying, he's like a completely different person now?" Agatha asked with interest. "There's a saying in the Exploration Group that the more extraordinary a person is, the more likely they are to have unusual quirks. Maybe this change is actually normal. Did Roland howl at the moon or spend a long time gesturing at walls when he was in the palace?"

"What kind of quirks are these..." Tilly shook her head helplessly, "Aside from acting a bit eccentrically, he wasn't much different from an ordinary person. However... I've heard that he once shouted during a court lesson that he wanted to marry a witch. Probably because of those words, Herman and Timothy always tormented him in the name of purifying the devil's claws, and even our father disliked such behavior. After that, his personality became increasingly obstinate."

"Being discriminated against for wanting to marry a witch?" Agatha curled her lips disdainfully. "In Taquila, that's considered a great aspiration. Of course, there are few who succeed, as most witches are unwilling to spend their lives with just one man."

"But we are different from four hundred years ago. If he were to marry a witch, he would have no children to inherit his possessions. How could father possibly look kindly on such thoughts?" Tilly sighed. "However, it's been over a decade, he must have forgotten those foolish words he said by now."

"Is that so?" Anna suddenly spoke up. "But he is still willing to marry a witch now."

"Huh, does he still remember—wait," Tilly's eyes widened in surprise. "You mean now?"

"Yes," she said with a gentle smile. "Prince Roland said so himself."

Tilly was instantly stunned.
