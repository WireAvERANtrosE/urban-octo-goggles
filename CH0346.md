## Remembrance (Part 2)
"Uh... Does this count as a high-level awakening?" the Prince asked.



Agatha did not know what to say for a moment, the only thought in her head was—why is this happening?



The Holy City was forgotten, the Union was destroyed, and logically, without specialized training and guidance, the witches' abilities should have regressed significantly. But what was she seeing now? A witch who had just come of age had already been promoted twice; this was not something that could simply be described as good luck. Even in the talent-filled Union, such witches were rare.



And if she hadn't misheard, were there three others just like Anna?



Agatha stared blankly at the man with grey hair for a long while before coming back to her senses. "This... should count, I suppose, but I don't have a Magic Stone of Retaliation to test the extent of the ability changes." She paused, her throat a little dry, "I would like to ask, what exactly did Anna experience during her awakening? She seems to have just come of age; did both changes occur within the short span of a year or two?"



After she spoke, Agatha realized that she had unconsciously used honorifics—witches could not pass on their legacy, and even if they gathered a large number of ordinary people as followers, there was no guarantee that they could produce powerful witches. Therefore, the upper echelons always determined one's rank by ability, not by lineage. Given Anna's current abilities, she already had the qualifications to enter the higher echelons of the Union. Compared to herself, Anna was at least her equal, if not her superior.



Any high-level awakened being was worthy of respect.



"The first time was due to the exhaustion of magic power while fighting against the demonic beasts, and the second time, I believe it was triggered by learning knowledge."



"Knowledge..." She was taken aback, "What kind of knowledge?"



"Cough cough, we can talk about this later," the prince cleared his throat, "Let's get back to the topic we were discussing just now. What exactly is the experiment of the God's Punishment Army of Akaris?"



It made sense. If he hadn't lied to her, this knowledge must contain incredibly profound principles, which is why Anna could awaken new abilities through epiphany. Before gaining trust, it was perfectly normal for him not to elaborate. Agatha couldn't help but feel excited; increasing the chances of promotion was of extraordinary significance for a witch. If she could grasp the principles, reviving the Union wouldn't be difficult.



But where did he obtain this knowledge? This was a backward and savage land, how could any villager understand the mysteries of magic? She was filled with confusion, what had the world become in over four hundred years?



Agatha set these perplexing questions aside for the moment, "Akaris is extremely powerful. With the Divine Stone of Judgement, she could hold her own against several Lords of Hell. However, there are simply too few above the Extraordinary. Or rather... we lost due to the diversity of abilities."



"Diversity?"



"Yes, no one knows what kind of power a witch will have before her awakening, but according to the statistics of the Union, only one in ten witches is suited for combat—this ratio also applies to the Extraordinary. And of this tenth of combat witches, how many can become Transcendents is completely unpredictable. The Union once faced the embarrassing situation of not having a single Transcendent emerge in fifty years, so the combat power of witches is very unstable."



"So, not every commoner can awaken, not every awakened can fight, and not every fighter can grow stronger, is that what you mean?" the prince stroked his chin.



"That's about right," Agatha sighed, "So we formed a guard composed of commoners to make up for the shortcomings of witches. But... commoners cannot defeat devils. Even if they carry the Divine Stone of Judgement, it's still far from enough to contend with the mighty demons. Under such disadvantageous circumstances, Akaris commanded the Quest Society to start researching warriors who could break through the limits of the human body. Judging from these rough notes, it seems she succeeded..."



"Seems?" the prince asked curiously, "Didn't you say you were a member of the Quest Society?"



"Indeed, but ever since that order was issued, I left the Quest Society of Taquila and built my own laboratory tower in the Hidden Forest," she bit her lip, hesitated for a moment, and then continued, "They soon found the direction, using the power of the Divine Stone of Judgement to forcibly combine witches and ordinary humans together, but... this process consumes the life of the witch. I cannot accept this method of experimentation. The Quest Society should focus on exploring the uses of the God's Stone, not treating witches as consumables. The notes are right; such actions will only bring destruction to the witches."



The prince seemed somewhat shocked, "Treating people as consumables?"



"Akalis had no choice at the time; Taquila was on the brink of destruction," Agatha saw the look of distress on his face, and for some reason, she suddenly found it a bit more agreeable, "But now the Union has dissipated like smoke in the air, and such things have not been preserved. They should not reappear in the future."



After finishing, she lowered her head, caressing the pages of the book, over mountains, across rivers... such familiar slogans. But where are you all now? How can I alone rebuild order?



"However, the God's Punishment Army still exists."



This statement made Agatha's fingers suddenly stiffen, and she looked at the prince incredulously, "What... did you say?"



"I don't know if it's a coincidence," he spoke very slowly, as if considering his words, "The Church... an organization you've never heard of, has built two cities in the middle of the Impassable Mountain Range, both called 'Holy City.' The hunt for witches is initiated by them, and not only that, but they are also searching everywhere for orphans and street children to take back to the monasteries in the Holy City for adoption. Wendy was one of those who escaped from there."



"The Church has its own army and territory, and the most powerful warriors among them are the God's Punishment Army, these mindless monsters with incredible strength, comparable to extraordinary witches, and their numbers are absolutely not few. Besides, they may even have a group of powerful witches, which is why I used the God's Punishment Chains to temporarily seal your abilities," the prince spread his hands and said, "Before you told us all this... we always thought that the people who built the Holy City of Taquila in the wastelands to fight against the demons were the Church, and that the relics were also left by the Church."



Agatha opened her mouth but couldn't say a word. An organization made up of ordinary people had actually taken away the most important secrets of the Union and turned around to hunt witches, creating the God's Punishment Army to consolidate their rule? She suddenly felt a splitting headache; the God's Punishment Army had not disappeared but had fallen into the hands of an organization that loathed witches! What on earth did those people of the Union do?



Seeing her exhaustion and discomfort, Wendy gently pushed her down onto the bed and whispered, "Let's call it a day, get some good sleep. Don't worry, we will find out the reason."



Then, she felt her ankles loosen, the God's Punishment Witch's shackles had already been removed by Anna. One by one, everyone left the room, with the gray-haired prince being the last to leave.



Just as he closed the door, Agatha heard a calm and steady voice.



"You are wrong about one thing, mortals can defeat devils."
