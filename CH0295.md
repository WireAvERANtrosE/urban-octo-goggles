## Spread Your Wings
At the moment Roland was hit, Nightingale felt her heart suddenly tighten.



The noisy surroundings instantly became incredibly distant. She wanted to go over and help him up, but found herself cold and stiff, her hands trembling slightly. Apart from the initial cry of shock, it was now extremely difficult to even take a step forward.



She was afraid that Roland would gradually lose his warmth in her arms.



She was afraid that he would never wake up again.



Just the thought of this made it hard for Nightingale to breathe.



From the time she had memories, she had never felt so helpless.



It was Anna who reacted first—she crouched down and covered the whole wound with a mass of black fire. The lightless flame immediately gave rise to plumes of white smoke, along with a sizzling sound. When the black fire dissipated, Roland's severed arm had been burnt into a lump of char.



The trickling blood had stopped.



Right, this was the emergency measure he had talked about in the first aid class. What should be done next? Dress the wound, quickly go to the hospital to find Nana... Nightingale swallowed saliva, glanced at the hanging basket, no, that won't do, Nana wasn't on the hot air balloon, but in Border Town.



I must go back.

I must hurry back as soon as possible!

She slowly turned her head in the southeast direction of the town—

Just then, the devil's ferocious and menacing form once again caught Nightingale's eye, pulling all her thoughts back to the basket.

The witches' panicked shouts, the sound of gunfire, and the enemy's deep roars returned to her ears. As the cold receded, the chaos in her mind finally converged into one sentence.

"Without defeating the devil, we cannot return to Border Town."

"Lightning!" Anna shouted anxiously, "Protect the hot air balloon as it descends!"

Despite her pale face, the young girl glanced at the unconscious Roland, then clenched her teeth, nodded, and flew out of the basket.

No, Nightingale thought, just by looking at her, she knew Lightning couldn't handle the devil. Like most witches, Lightning had no experience in battling real enemies.



The only one who can defeat the devil here is oneself.



Nightingale took a deep breath and forced herself to temporarily put aside the scene of His Highness the prince getting injured. The two devils were still attacking from the front and back, their spear-throwing arms as thin as kindling, and it would probably take a long time for them to fully recover. The enemy was about fifty meters away from the hot air balloon, a distance she simply couldn't reach—unfolding the Mist in mid-air could easily lead to losing one’s footing and falling. The higher from the ground, the fewer those fleeting “lines” appeared, and if she stayed on one line for too long when the direction and orientation changed, she could very well be torn into pieces.



Perhaps realizing that things might get tricky once the hot air balloon landed, one of the devils waved its left hand that only had three fingers, shouting something, then it spurred its mount and charged straight towards the hot air balloon.



The other devil pounced towards Lightning, the demonic beast flapping its huge wings like a hawk hunting a fledgling, forcing her to focus on evading. As Nightingale had predicted, aside from relying on agile movements to protect herself, Lightning found it difficult to take aim and shoot. The other witches even stopped firing, fearing they might accidentally hit the young girl.



The devil heading towards the hot air balloon urged its mount to bite and claw at the balloon, but thankfully, Sori’s coating was tough enough that the mixed-breed demonic beast’s claws and teeth found it hard to penetrate. Seeing that this tactic was ineffective, it roared and flew some distance away, apparently trying to use its impact to knock the hot air balloon off balance.



Nightingale had already spotted the best opportunity.



Unfolding the Mist, when a faintly glowing thin line appeared above her head, she stepped onto it without hesitation. Taking advantage of the moment when the outline of the hot air balloon changed, she stood directly on top of the balloon. Although her body was parallel to the ground, she moved as if on solid footing and quickly climbed to the top of the balloon.



At that moment, the devil was charging straight at her.



In the black and white world, Nightingale was surprised to find that there was a sparse magic vortex slowly rotating inside the devil’s body, and on that thin arm was embedded a shimmering stone.



They actually have magic powers?

But now is not the time to pay attention to this. The sprint distance of more than ten meters is just a moment for her. As the devil is about to collide with the hot air balloon, Nightingale leaps out of the fog and has already appeared behind the devil.

The Giantwinged Evilbeast, due to the sudden increase in weight on its back, sank sharply downward. The devil seemed to realize something and turned its head fiercely, only to be met by the roar of a 12mm caliber pistol.

"Die."

The bullet burst out of the flames and smoke, carrying an immense force as it penetrated the devil's headgear and blew open a bowl-sized hole in the back of its brain. Thick blood splattered everywhere, and a pungent stench spread out.

The enemy convulsed and fell, and the Evilbeast also veered off course, skimming past the side of the hot air balloon. Just as Nightingale was about to fold back to the top of the balloon, an accident occurred. The tilting corpse dragged the reins, causing her mount to suddenly roll to the side, flinging her out.

Before she could react, she had already left the safe distance from which she could return on her own.

Although the hot air balloon was continuously lowering its altitude, it was still hundreds of meters away from the sea surface at this moment. Falling into the fog was no different from suicide—if she collided with any thin line while unable to control her posture, she would be cut in two.

"Nightingale!"



She heard the panicked cries of her sisters, but it was all to no avail. Lightning was entangled in combat with the devil, and even if Maggie turned into an osprey, she was powerless to pull herself up. She was very clear about the outcome she was about to face.

The speed of the fall was getting faster and faster. Nightingale looked down and saw the once blurry ocean revealing its true face, with the frothing spray and waves becoming increasingly clear—as if it wasn't her that was falling, but the sea rushing up to collide with her.

The closer it came to that moment, the clearer her mind became.

Nightingale closed her eyes, and the fragments of her meeting with Roland seemed to reappear before her eyes. She sat at the edge of the bed, fiddling with the dagger in her hand, waiting for the gray-haired Fourth Prince to push the door and enter. The flickering firelight, the door panel, and the bedroom gradually faded away, leaving only the smiling face of the other person.

Her only regret was probably that she couldn't accompany him to the end.

"Co-co-co-co!"

Suddenly, a series of exuberant coos sounded in her ears. Nightingale opened her eyes to see a white figure plunging straight down, crashing into her chest.

It was Maggie.

Just as she was about to say something, a dazzling white light burst from the pigeon's body, and its shape instantly swelled. A pair of enormous flesh wings unfolded from its back, feathers falling all around, and the bird's head became fierce and terrifying, looking just like a flying demonic beast!



"Awoo——!" Maggie let out a deafening roar, her claws grabbing Nightingale and forcefully tossing her upwards. The latter somersaulted in mid-air, landing squarely on the broad back of the bird.

What in the world was happening? Nightingale was completely stunned.

"Awoo, awoo!" Maggie turned her head and cried out again, as if to remind her of something.

This time, even without translation, she understood the meaning behind the other’s words. Although she wasn't entirely clear on how Maggie could transform into this state, defeating the devil was the most important matter at hand.

"Go!" she shouted.
