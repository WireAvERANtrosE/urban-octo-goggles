## Spread Your Wings
Watching Roland being hit, Nightingale felt a sudden tightness in her chest.

The noisy surroundings instantly became distant. She wanted to go over and help him up, but found herself cold and stiff, her hands trembling slightly. Apart from the initial instinctive cry of alarm, it was now incredibly difficult for her to even take a step forward.

She was afraid that Roland would gradually lose his warmth in her arms.

She was afraid that he would never wake up again.

Just thinking about it made it hard for Nightingale to breathe.

Since having memories, she had never felt so helpless.

It was Anna who reacted first—she squatted down and covered the entire wound with a clump of black fire. The lightless flame immediately gave rise to wisps of white smoke, and a sizzling sound. When the black fire disappeared, Roland's severed arm had been burned to a charred stump.

The trickling blood had stopped.

Right, this was the emergency measure he had talked about during the first aid class. What should be done next? Dress the wound, and quickly head to the hospital to find Nana... Nightingale swallowed, glanced at the basket, no, that wouldn't work, Nana wasn't on the hot air balloon, but in Border Town.



I have to go back.

I must hurry back as soon as possible!

She slowly turned her head towards the southeast direction of the town—

At that moment, the devil's ferocious and clawed figure once again entered Nightingale's sight, pulling all her thoughts back to the hanging basket.

The witches' panicked cries, the sound of gunfire, and the deep roar of the enemy returned to her ears. After the coldness receded, the chaotic thoughts in her mind finally converged into one sentence.

"Without defeating the devil, I can't rush back to Border Town."

"Lightning!" Anna shouted anxiously, "Protect the hot air balloon as it lands!"

Although the little girl's face was pale, she looked at the unconscious Roland, then clenched her teeth, nodded, and flew out of the basket.

No, Nightingale thought, just looking at her, you know she can't deal with the devil. Like most witches, Lightning has no experience in fighting a real enemy.



Only oneself could defeat the devil here.

Nightingale took a deep breath, forcing herself to momentarily set aside the scene of His Highness the Prince getting injured. The two devils were still in a pincer attack formation, with the spear-throwing arm so skinny it looked like a piece of firewood, and it would probably take a long time to fully recover. The enemy was about fifty meters away from the hot air balloon, a distance she simply couldn't reach—unfurling the Mist in mid-air made it very easy to lose footing and fall. The higher from the ground, the fewer those fleeting "lines" appeared, and if she stayed on one line for too long as the direction and orientation changed, she might very well be torn into several pieces.



It seemed that the enemy also realized that once the hot air balloon landed, things could become tricky. One of the devils, waving its left hand that had only three fingers, shouted something loudly, then spurred its mount and charged straight towards the hot air balloon.



The other devil pounced towards Lightning, the demonic beast with huge wings like a falcon hunting a fledgling chick, forcing her to focus on evasion. Just as Nightingale had anticipated, aside from relying on nimble movements to protect herself, Lightning found it difficult to aim and fire at her opponent. The other witches even stopped shooting, fearful of accidentally hitting the young girl.



The devil heading for the hot air balloon directed its mount to bite and scratch wildly at the balloon's envelope. Fortunately, the coating applied by Soraya was tough enough that the mixed-breed demonic beast's claws and teeth had a hard time penetrating it. Seeing this tactic fail, the devil roared and flew a distance away, seemingly trying to use a collision to knock the hot air balloon off balance.



Nightingale had already spotted the best opportunity.

She unfolded the Mist, and when a faintly glowing thin line appeared above her head, she stepped onto it without hesitation. Taking advantage of the momentary shift in the outline of the hot air balloon, she stood directly on top of the envelope. Even though her body was parallel to the ground, it was as if she was walking on solid land, and she quickly climbed to the top of the balloon.



The devil was also charging straight towards her at that moment.

In the monochrome world, Nightingale was surprised to find that inside the devil's body, there was a sparse swirl of magical power slowly rotating, and on that skinny arm was embedded a shining stone.



They actually possess magic power?

But now was not the time to worry about that. A sprint of over ten meters was nothing but a fleeting moment for her. Just as the devil was about to collide with the hot air balloon, Nightingale leapt out of the mist, already appearing behind the demon.

The Winged Beast, burdened by the sudden increase in weight, abruptly sank downwards, and the devil, as if realizing something, snapped its head back, only to be greeted by the roar of a 12mm caliber pistol.

"Die."

The bullet burst forth from the flames and gunsmoke, carrying the force of thunder as it penetrated the devil's headgear and blasted a bowl-sized hole in the back of its skull. Viscous blood sprayed everywhere, and a pungent stench of blood scattered in all directions.

The enemy twitched and fell, and the Winged Beast also veered off course, skimming past the side of the hot air balloon. Just as Nightingale was about to turn back to the top of the balloon, an accident occurred. The tilting corpse pulled the reins, and the mount suddenly rolled over, flinging her out.

Before she could react, she had already left the safe distance that would allow her to return on her own.

Although the hot air balloon had been descending steadily, it was still hundreds of meters away from the sea surface at that moment. Falling into the mist at this point was no different from suicide—if she couldn't control her posture, hitting any thin line would slice her in two.

"Nightingale!"



She heard her sisters' panicked shouts, but it was all in vain. Lightning was entangled in a battle with the devil, and even if Maggie turned into an osprey, she was powerless to pull herself up. She was acutely aware of the outcome she was about to face.

The speed of her fall increased rapidly. Nightingale looked down, and the ocean, which had been a blur, now revealed its true face, with the rolling spray and waves becoming ever clearer—as if it was not she who was falling, but the sea rushing up to collide with her.

The closer she got to this moment, the clearer her mind became.

Nightingale closed her eyes, and the scenes of her meeting with Roland seemed to replay before her. She sat on the edge of the bed, toying with the dagger in her hand, waiting for the gray-haired Fourth Prince to push the door open. The flickering firelight, the door, and the bedroom gradually faded away, leaving only the smiling face of the other person.

Her only regret, perhaps, was that she wouldn't be able to accompany him to the end.

"Coo-coo-coo-coo!"

Suddenly, a series of high-pitched coos reached her ears. Nightingale opened her eyes to see a white figure diving straight down, crashing into her chest.

It was Maggie.

Just as she was about to say something, a dazzling white light burst from the pigeon's body. Her form swelled in an instant, a pair of huge wings unfolded from her back, feathers fell away, and her bird's head became ferocious and frightening, looking just like a flying demonic beast!



"Awoo—!" Maggie let out a deafening roar, her claws grasping Nightingale and forcefully tossing her upwards. The latter somersaulted in mid-air and landed squarely on the broad back of the bird.



What in the world was happening? Nightingale was completely stunned.



"Awoo awoo!" Maggie turned her head and cried out again, as if to remind her of something.



Even without translation, she understood the meaning behind the other's words. Although she was unclear as to how Maggie could transform into this form, defeating the demons was the most pressing matter at hand.



"Go!" she shouted.
