## Different Choices
The light from the fireplace flickered twice and gradually dimmed. Nightingale appeared and added a few more logs to the fire. The stove immediately made a crackling sound, and the flames suddenly brightened.



Roland gazed at the elongated shadows of the cups, letting out a deep sigh. Tilly had left some time ago, and he had been reflecting on their conversation ever since, wondering if there was any way to change the outcome, but ultimately, he couldn't find an answer—trust is a peculiar thing; apart from investing time, other methods are hardly effective.



"So, there are things you can't do after all," Nightingale brushed the dust off her hands and walked back to her usual spot, "What exactly did you say to her that day?"



"Kind lies," Roland leaned back in his chair, "It's normal for her to be unwilling to believe." He paused, "You said before that you had a brother; if he suddenly became very different from before, yet insisted he was still himself, would you believe him?"



"Are you referring to that seemingly innocent guy who betrayed me the moment he turned around?" Nightingale curled her lips, "In my view, there's hardly any difference between him and a mutation."



"Alright, I shouldn't have brought that up."



"It doesn't matter, I've already left the Granger family. They are all strangers to me now," she said nonchalantly.



"I was once as much a stranger to her," Roland sighed, "Or rather, I didn't get along well with anyone in the palace."



"If you're feeling troubled, feel free to talk to me about it," Nightingale said with a slight smile, "I've always been very curious about life in the palace, and I'd like to know just how terrible your personality was, to have such a bad reputation spread all the way to Silver City."



"To be honest, I was much worse back then," Roland couldn't help but curl the corner of his mouth, recalling a few past events, "I suppose from the moment I pushed her into the glass shards, she began to detest me."

"That sounds pretty... terrible," she clicked her tongue, "But I think she doesn't hate you now."

"Oh?" Roland raised an eyebrow, "How would you know that?"

"Of course, didn't she say a few words?—'Personally, I also hope to stay here and learn those interesting pieces of knowledge,'" Nightingale mimicked, "It sounds like words of comfort, but in fact, when she said this, she wasn't lying. If she still hated you as before, she wouldn't want to stay here at all."

"Are you trying to console me?" Roland laughed.

"If stating the truth counts as consolation," she shrugged, "Besides, I think maintaining the status quo is quite good."

"Why?"

"She promised to prioritize providing witches for the town, supporting your fight against the demons, so what difference does it make whether she's here or not. If all the witches from Sleeping Island were to flood in all at once, and there were a few more like Ashes, I'd be run off my feet," Nightingale popped a piece of dried fish into her mouth, muttering, "Not everyone is as obedient as Maggie."

Roland couldn't help but laugh, "From what you're saying, it sounds like you've had some trouble with Ashes?"



"Ah? No, why would I?" Nightingale waved her hand dismissively, "I just keep an eye on her occasionally to make sure she doesn't harm any members of the Witch Union."

"Really?"

She turned her head and whistled.

"I don't know if it's just my imagination," Roland stared at her, "but why do I feel like you're actually quite happy that I was turned down?"

"That's just your imagination," Nightingale asserted, then she looked towards the door, "Uh, someone else is coming." With those words, she vanished from sight.

Was this a case of the cicada shedding its skin? Just as he thought this, there was a knock on the office door.

Roland was surprised; it was almost midnight, who could it be at this hour? He fitted a new candle into the candlestick, "Come in."

The person who pushed the door open was Agatha.

This made the prince startled, "What brings you here?"



The other party walked to the round stool in front of the table without saying a word and sat down. "Ms. Wendy told me that whether it is the musket that can restrain the extraordinary or the cannon with an astonishing range, all originated from your ideas? And the principles and methods of making these things are all recorded in the books you wrote?"



"Are you referring to 'The Basics of Natural Science Theory' and 'Elementary Chemistry'? They indeed contain the relevant principles, but as for the methods of production, they are not included due to the limited space," Roland said. "After all, these are just introductory theoretical textbooks. Did you come to ask me about this?"



"Only the members of the Witch Union can learn this knowledge, right?" She did not answer, but continued to ask.



Roland nodded, already guessing what the other party wanted to say.



"Then I apply to join the Witch Union," Agatha said almost without pause.



"But the Witch Union is an organization belonging to Border Town. Are you sure you want to serve the town?" he asked curiously. "Its lord is not someone above the extraordinary, but just a normal mortal."



"Someone who can create weapons powerful enough to fight against the devils cannot be considered 'normal.' Even the Quest Society would reserve a place for you," Agatha paused slightly. "As long as it does not harm witches and does not become an enemy of the survivors of the Union, I don't mind collaborating with a mortal..."



She would probably mention that serving a mortal was a bit difficult for her at the moment, but Agatha's capacity for acceptance was impressive to Roland. Maybe those engaged in research were always able to quickly accept new things. He suppressed the smile in his heart, "I originally thought you would follow Tilly to Sleeping Island, which is a city formed by witches."



"It's just a refuge to evade the pursuit of the Church," she shook her head, "I made this decision after inquiring clearly from them. Besides, I've seen too many cities ruled by witches before the freeze, and now they have all perished into dust. It's meaningless if we do not defeat the devils. I hope to see the hope of victory here."



"You will," Roland nodded, "but I cannot guarantee that we will not be enemies of the Union... because it may not have perished, but instead changed its name and hidden itself."

"What?" Agatha was stunned.

"I have thought carefully about what you said. Even if they failed and fled from Taquila, the Union had Extraordinaries and a group of Holy Warriors. In this uncivilized land full of natives, it is highly unlikely that they would completely cut off all communications unless they wanted to do so themselves," Roland said solemnly, "It is very likely that the Church is the incarnation of the Union—it wasn't ordinary people who took power and the method of creating God's Punishment Army from the witches, but the witches themselves who transformed the Union into an organization hunting their own kind. In this way, it would be more convenient for them to create a large number of God's Punishment Army soldiers."

"Are you saying... the current oppression and hunting of witches, the tragic situation they are in, it's all done by the Union?" she asked incredulously.

"I can't be certain; this is just a speculation," Roland stood up and walked over to the bookshelf, pulled out several thick, black leather books and handed them to her, "These books contain the chronicles written by the Church itself, as well as the histories of the four major kingdoms recorded by astrologers. You can refer to them. Regardless, the Church is now our enemy and an entity that we must eliminate in the future."

"If you decide to stand with the witches and join me in the fight against the devils, the Witch Union welcomes you."
