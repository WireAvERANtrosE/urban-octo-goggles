## The Witch's Choice
Leaf had no idea how she had managed to survive these past days.



It had taken her nearly half a month to return to the Fertile Plains campsite from the Barbarian Land. To avoid the demonic beasts, she carefully hid within the thick trunks of trees, making sure there were no demonic beasts nearby before proceeding to the next hiding spot. Despite her urgency, she had no other choice. Once discovered by a mixed breed demonic beast, she wouldn't be able to escape their pursuit on her own.



More than ten sisters had fallen to the devils' slaughter, and the abilities of the other sisters were simply not suited for combat. They had scattered and fled when the ironhand devil leaped into the crowd to kill at will, but Leaf had no idea how many of them could actually make it back to the camp alive. She didn't even dare to contemplate this dreadful question.



Moving and hiding along the way consumed a great deal of her magic power. She could only cover a little more than ten miles per day, especially since she had to reserve magic power for the night. After her dried food ran out, she transformed some wild fruits into food that could stave off hunger and thirst. The Witch Union badge had long lost its warming function, so she had to wrap herself even tighter with tree bark. Thinking of Snow, who had died before reaching adulthood, Leaf couldn't stop her tears from falling.



Worse yet, on the fourth night, she was met with a demonic plague within the tree trunk—a series of blows that had almost made her forget about it. A tearing pain suddenly burst from her chest and spread rapidly throughout her body. It almost made her lose consciousness, and she bit her tongue until her mouth was full of blood in order to concentrate and fight the pain. Under the torment of the demonic plague, Leaf had thought about giving up, but the thought of the more than twenty sisters who might have survived, either waiting for her at the camp or suffering from serious injuries and in need of her healing and assistance, made her grit her teeth and persevere.



Fortunately, this episode of the demonic plague did not last long. When she finally emerged from the ordeal, her body was covered in cuts, and the blood that flowed out had soaked the inside of the tree trunk. To avoid attracting demonic beasts with the scent of blood, she had to endure the pain, take off her clothes, and move to another large tree. At the same time, she made bare branches grow leaves and then fashioned the leaves into warm clothing. Under the guidance of her magic, the branches became her needles, and the leaf veins her thread.



All along the way, she had not had a single bite of cooked food, nor a sip of hot water. After entering the Impassable Mountain Range, even though she added two more layers to her leaf clothing and wrapped her hands and feet tightly, the rapidly decreasing temperature and the snow that reached her ankles still caused frostbite to her toes. Thus, stopping and going, dragging her numb feet, she finally returned to the camp.



Seeing the familiar figures of her sisters, Leaf collapsed to the ground.



When she came to, it was already two days later. Prolonged hypothermia caused severe damage to her feet, and the herbs could not stop the gangrene that was spreading. With no other choice, her sisters amputated two toes from both her left and right feet.



Leaf did not pay too much attention to her own wellbeing, as just being alive was already a blessing. Compared to those sisters who would never return, she was fortunate enough. However, when she saw the white bands wrapped around the arms of the survivors, an immense sorrow welled up uncontrollably from within her heart.



There were forty-two sisters when they set out, and now only six remained.



After everyone consoled Leaf, Scroll, the eldest among them, recounted their ordeal.



While she was entangled in battle with the devils, the witches with non-combat abilities took the chance to flee towards the camp. That very night, they encountered the demonic beasts—a group of wild boar-like creatures. Powerless to resist, they scattered and ran. The ones hunted down by the demonic beasts clearly had little chance of survival, but there was no time for them to worry about that. By the next morning, they were targeted by a wolf hybrid, and only eight managed to escape. Fortunately, after entering the Impassable Mountain Range, the demonic beasts did not follow.



A few days after returning to the camp, two sisters successively showed symptoms of magical backlash. Perhaps because the Witch Cooperation Association had suffered too great a blow this time and the outlook was bleak, neither of them survived the devil's consumption. As the combat witches had yet to return, just when everyone thought they had perished at the hands of the devils, unexpectedly, Leaf came back.



“So... what about the others? Chili, Chase, and Teacher, how are they?”



Leaf shook her head, “Only I survived.”



“Is that so...” Scroll responded softly, clearly having anticipated this answer, “Then you should rest well. And...” she hesitated, “Leaf.”



“What?”



"While you were unconscious, we discussed that if Cara doesn't come back, we hope that you can take over the position of mentor."

Leaf was stunned, then closed her eyes. Indeed, the Mutual Aid Society would likely crumble immediately without electing a new leader after such a devastating blow. But the purpose of the Mutual Aid Society was to search for the Holy Mountain, to find freedom and a place of rest. Now the search for the Holy Mountain had turned into a pipe dream, no, the "Holy Mountain" itself was a hoax, it didn't exist in the Impassable Mountain Range, nor in the Barbarian Land. With this in mind, was there still a need for the Mutual Aid Society to exist?



Her mind was in turmoil, and even without looking, she could feel the expectant gazes of her sisters. They needed someone to step forward and lead them through their confusion.



"Let's... go find Nightingale," Leaf said after a long silence.



"What, find her?"



"You mean go to Border Town?"



"What if she's deceiving us, what then?"



"Wendy is there too."



"Maybe she's already dead."



The sisters clamored all at once. Scroll clapped her hands to quiet everyone down and asked Leaf, "What if what Nightingale has said is also a scam?"



"You all can wait in a safe place outside the town," she opened her eyes, "Let me go and find out what's going on first. If she is lying, I will take over the position of Mentor. If... if I die in town, Scroll, you lead the sisters and continue to move forward."



"But I..."



Leaf managed a strained smile, "I know your ability is not suited for combat, and you're not of much help with the daily operations of the camp. But now I understand that the strength or weakness of one's ability is not related to one's suitability to be a Mentor." A Mentor is a guide, not the strongest among us, it's a pity that I realized this too late. If the Mentor of the Witch Cooperation Association had been the patient and meticulous Wendy, would the outcome have been completely different? "Like Wendy, you were one of the earliest to join the Witch Cooperation Association, and you are an elder among the sisters. You have come all the way from the eastern side of the Kingdom to the Impassable Mountain Range with everyone, your experience is rich, and your actions are prudent, everyone sees this. No one is more suitable to be the Mentor of the sisters than you."



Scroll was silent for a moment, "...And if what Nightingale said is all true?"



"Then the Witch Cooperation Association will no longer be necessary," Leaf slowly said, "Border Town will be our 'New Holy Mountain'."
