## Honeysuckle and Elk (Part 2)
Peter approached the crowd, "What's going on?" he asked.



"Lord Helmann," someone saw the Honeysuckle crest on his chest, "we're talking about the lord of Border Town. He's confiscated the properties of the stronghold nobles in the small town."



"Just call me Peter, what exactly happened?"



"Let me explain it to you, Mr. Peter," Simon pushed forward with a flattering smile, "it's like this, we're ordered by the duke to live in Border Town, managing the Northern Slope Mine for the main house. Every winter, we bring the townspeople back to Longsong Stronghold to protect them from demonic beasts. This year, when the Evil Months ended, my colleague from the Fletchers family, Corlys, was told by the lord of Border Town that his house had been dismantled by the townspeople, with no compensation whatsoever!"



"Either admit that the house isn't yours, or be thrown into prison and hanged for desertion," he mimicked the words of the Fourth Prince, Roland, "Mr., listen to this, what is this desertion charge? This is something every mine manager has done for centuries."



Peter couldn't help but recall the image of the young man with grey hair, although the prince was portrayed extremely negatively by outsiders, based on his own two encounters, Roland Wimbledon was no ordinary individual. And this charge of desertion was just an excuse the other party had casually found— the prince had never intended to reason with these people.



He had completely broken with Longsong Stronghold, Peter thought, or to think deeper, would the prince not know that the townspeople and nobles go to the stronghold for refuge every year? Obviously not. He clearly knew, yet he imposed a charge, forcing the other party to make a choice, and even let them spread such a barbaric result back to Longsong Stronghold—what exactly did the prince want to do?



"But he is the lord of Border Town," the person who previously sneered at Simon said, "the lord has the authority to adjudicate the laws within his territory."



"Border Town is also under the jurisdiction of the Western Region!" Simon said coldly and displeased, "Are you questioning Lord Lion's authority? Stationing in the town to oversee the mine work is by his lordship's will. Now Roland has taken all the nobles' houses for himself, this is an open defiance against the six great families, Lord Lion will not stand by and do nothing."



"You're talking about the executioner who hanged Hill Fawkes without even issuing a formal document?" Rene had approached at some point, "My father was furious about it."



"Lord Mead," Simon greeted with a bow, "it is indeed that man. He's acting even more recklessly now, and I'm afraid only Duke Ryan can stop him. I hope you can pass the message for us."



"Don't worry, whether that happened or not, Lord Lion is already preparing to make a move against him," Rene said nonchalantly, "I came back just for this. My brother is negotiating a trade in the King's City, and only I can lead the Moose family now."



"Really? That's great," Simon said, delighted.



Peter frowned. He knew that ever since the decree was sent out in winter, and Prince Roland chose to stay in Border Town, such a day was inevitable. However, he didn't expect his friend to be armoring up for battle. Ignoring the puzzled looks from the others, he pulled Rene aside and tried to persuade him, "You shouldn't go; that's the prince."



"I know he's a prince, a prince of the hillbilly kind," Rene Mead patted Peter's shoulder, "Don't worry, Lord Lion won't harm someone of royal blood. Maybe he'll surrender as soon as we get there. Even if he wants to resist, all we need to do is mount a charge and all those farmers and miners will scatter. The Fourth Prince isn't skilled with the sword or gun; I doubt he could even harm a hair on our heads."



No, I'm worried that you'll be harmed by him... Peter opened his mouth but didn't voice his concern. He knew the other man wouldn't believe him because even he found it hard to believe that the prince could defeat Duke Ryan's allied forces with a group of miners. Yet, for some reason, he felt uneasy.



"Young Master Peter, your father asks for your return; he has urgent matters to discuss with you," an elderly butler with a head of white hair suddenly hurried to Peter's side and whispered.



"I understand," Peter nodded, said an early goodbye to Rene, and together with the butler, rode the carriage back to the Earl of Honeysuckle's residence.



"Father," he walked into the study where Shalafi Helmann was busy writing something at the desk.



Hearing Peter's voice, the Earl didn't stop writing, "Go and summarize the output, population, and income of the territory and hand it over to me. I need to arrange the spring expedition. the Duke of Lion's conscription order has come down. After the snow melts, all five of our major families must provide knights and mercenaries to campaign for him in Border Town."



"How many are we to send?"



The Earl paused slightly and looked up, "What's the matter? You've never cared about this before." He opened a letter on the desk, "At least twenty-five knights, along with their respective squires and horses. Forty mercenaries, all fully armed. Over a hundred freemen or serfs, each equipped with simple weapons."



Peter estimated in his heart that the five major families would have about a thousand men together, and with the Duke's own forces, it was a formidable power capable of sweeping through the Western Territory. Even if the Longsong Stronghold didn't send out all its forces, this army was not something Border Town could withstand. There were only a little over two thousand people there.



"Father, can you stay out of the battlefield?" He hesitated for a moment before speaking up.



"What's the matter, child?" asked the Earl, surprised.



"I am worried about your safety."



Shalafi couldn't help but laugh, "Do you realize what you're saying? Would there be any danger if an elephant stepped on an ant? His Highness the Prince has only a few knights and less than fifty personal guards, while our numbers are ten times his!"



In theory, that is indeed the case. Before meeting His Highness, Peter would have thought the same. But... "Father, everyone says that walls made of mud will collapse when it rains, yet the walls overseen by Prince Roland did not. They also said that the miners of Border Town alone couldn't possibly hold back the demonic beasts, but not only did His Highness accomplish this, but by the end of the Evil Months, not a single person fled back to the stronghold." The more he spoke, the more uneasy he felt, "Now, everyone believes that for Duke to defeat Roland Wimbledon, it would be like an elephant trampling an ant. Father, will the outcome really be like this?"



"Enough!" Shalafi slammed the table. Shaking his head, he stood up and walked to a wall—where the portraits of his ancestors were hanging. "Compared to fighting on horseback, it's normal for you to prefer business and negotiation. But being a merchant does not equate to being cowardly! Those merchants who sail across the seas face the threat of death every day." He knocked on the wall and spoke loudly, "Look up there, your grandfather, your great-grandfather, they all stood their ground in this land filled with beasts, refugees, and bandits with the help of swords and longbows. Your fear of conflict is such a disappointment to me!"



No, Father. Peter bowed his head, no longer arguing, but muttered in his heart, you also know that was my grandfather and great-grandfather. Look at those strong faces, then look at your loose belt and the double chin spilling out. Father, can you still mount a horse and draw a bow now?
