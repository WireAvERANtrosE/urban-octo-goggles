## New Clearwater
The granite steps of the Holy City of Eternal Winter were stained red with blood, and the sweet, pungent smell in the air was so strong it was almost irritating.



Many bodies lay on the ground—there were God's Punishment Army soldiers, believers, our own people, and Sand People. They died in various states, most of them with signs of being scorched, with shattered limbs and viscera scattered everywhere. Farry knew that they had been killed by the impact and burning of the violent snow powder.



With every step he took, he felt a sticky sensation under his feet. The combat will of the church's Judgement Army and the believers could be described as crazed. Even when faced with numerous slaves enhanced by drugs, they still did not retreat and used their bodies as shields to entangle the enemy. They did this all just to create an opportunity for their comrades to deliver a fatal blow—the pills might grant people strength and indifference to pain, but the heart, neck, and head were still vulnerable, and Her Majesty did not have spare armor to equip these cheap slaves.



If it weren't for the snow powder, the outcome of the battle might have been hard to say.



But we won... Farry felt a burning heat in his heart, we finally won! Queen Clearwater's flag was already flying atop the city, and even the church's strongest stronghold could not withstand this wave of attack. With this, the Black Sail fleet was freed from being trapped in a corner of Greycastle, no longer having to be slowly drained of vitality in an endless war of attrition with Timothy.



The temple hall was also in disarray, with shattered glass and blood flowing everywhere, but he paid no attention to these and walked straight to the woman standing in the center of the hall, radiant with vigor, and knelt on one knee, "Your Majesty, all four city gates have fallen into the hands of the Black Sail, the Holy City of Eternal Winter is yours now."



"You've worked hard, rise," Grace extended her hand to him.



Farry gently grasped the queen's hand, placed a symbolic kiss on the back of her fingers, and then stood up to stand by her side.



"Strange etiquette," Kabala suddenly spoke up from the side, "you didn't even touch her hand, so why put on such an act?"

The question was so abrupt that it made him frown, but since the other party was the chief of the Sand Nation, he couldn't publicly rebuke her for being rude. He could only respond coldly, "This is a common courtesy among nobles, representing politeness and respect. It's actually impolite to touch, and as someone from the Sand People, it's quite normal for you not to understand."

"Is that so?" She raised an eyebrow and pointed to the collar around her neck, "We are allies who have fought together, and right after the battle ends, you want to put this thing on me. The courtesy and respect of the people from the mainland are indeed puzzling."

The collar around Kabala's neck was a ring of iron, bulging in the middle, looking like a piece of jewelry at first glance, but Farryn knew that inside it was wrapped a God's Punishment Stone. Apart from a specially made key, it was difficult to unlock the iron collar by other means, and the key was in Grace's possession. The other party was a witch, and naturally had to be treated cautiously, but she had indeed contributed a lot in the battle. Without her command of the Art of Command, those slaves carrying the highly explosive snow powder would probably not have dared to rush towards the tightly defended line of believers. He opened his mouth, but did not know how to retort.

"Alright, let's not argue over such a trivial matter," Grace interrupted, "Don't forget the purpose of our coming here—compared to a vast land to live on, can you not even tolerate a stone?"

"I was just saying," Kabala shrugged, "I hope you will fulfill your promise."

"Of course, it is the foundation of our cooperation," the queen said with a slight smile.

"What should we do with Black Sail next?" Farryn asked.

"Let's talk about the next step of the plan later. For now, let us watch a good show," Grace clapped her hands and commanded her personal guards, "Bring her up."



Before long, two armored guards escorted a woman with her hands bound behind her back into the Holy Temple.

She appeared to be around thirty years old, with an ordinary countenance and disheveled brown hair scattered around her cheeks. She was dressed in a golden church robe, the kind of finely made and carefully selected garment that only bishops of Hermes could wear. At this moment, the magnificent robe was already torn in several places and stained with blood.

"Is this person... a bishop?"

"Exactly," Queen Clearwater curled her lips, "I have had the local nobility confirm it; she is one of the three great bishops of the church, Lady Heather." She turned her gaze to the other, "Am I right?"

"..." Heather did not respond, but Phyllis could see thick sarcasm and contempt in her eyes.

Clearly, Grace also sensed this, as she chuckled lightly, "I also think you would not surrender. So, with a kind heart, I brought you to the Holy Temple, to send you back to the divine realm here. You can slowly beg for redemption from the gods, or you can beg me for mercy. I will gradually cut off your fingers, limbs, and facial features, letting you fully experience the pain and helplessness of the people of Clearwater Harbor."

"And then what?" The bishop spoke unexpectedly, "Crushed into dust by the church's great army? Or do you plan to drift at sea forever, never to land?"

"You need not worry about that," Grace gestured to her guards to proceed, "Compared to that, the church's army is currently attacking Wolfheart City. Hermes is like an undefended city, which is much more important than my fate. I may not be able to set foot on the soil of the New Holy City, but I can manage to turn the Old Holy City at the foot of the plateau into ruins. You must have heard of the river water from the extreme south of Greycastle; it ignites easily and is quite hard to extinguish. And this time, I have brought an entire ship's worth."

The guard drew a dagger, approached the bishop pressed to the ground, and cleanly cut off two of her fingers.



Heather gritted her teeth, not letting out a cry of pain.

Queen of Clearwater stepped onto the main staircase of the hall, sat on the broad throne, propped her chin with her right hand, and revealed an expression of great interest.

...Again, three fingers, and now the opponent's left hand had turned into a bare palm, beads of sweat the size of beans appeared on Heather's forehead.

"Do you really have to do this?" Kabala shook her head, "If it's not to deter enemies or to extract information, such pure torture is unnecessary."

"Unnecessary?" Grace laughed, "You should say that to her. Do you know what happens to the witches who fall into the hands of the church? I guess you wouldn't be interested in knowing."

"Hahaha..." At this moment, Heather, who had lost all ten fingers, suddenly burst into laughter, "You simply don't understand the greatness of the church, nor will you understand how important everything done by the Holy City is. You always accompany ignorance, yet you're clueless about the impending doom! Hermes will show you what true power is—the only end for those who oppose the church is destruction!"

"Is that so..." Grace crossed her legs and smiled, "Then I look forward to seeing that."

Until the archbishop died, she did not cry out for mercy. What surprised Farryn, however, was that she also did not call out to God's name, seeking salvation from the deities. In the end, as Heather was about to lose consciousness from excessive blood loss, her expression was terrifyingly indifferent, not as if she were undergoing punishment, but rather as if she were watching an irrelevant farce—through those eyes, Farryn felt as though he saw his own inevitable future.

This feeling made him feel inexplicably oppressed, almost as though he couldn't catch his breath.



"Behead her and hang it at the entrance of the church," Grace ordered after confirming the bishop's death. Then, she turned to Farrina, "Next, we can talk about our plan."



"Yes, Your Majesty," he suppressed the unease swirling in his heart, "Do you plan to attack Hermes?"



"That's correct, but not with the full army." She unfolded a cowhide map she carried with her. "Leave only the minimum number of sailors and some slaves from the Eastern Region on the Black Sail Fleet, and navigate the fleet westward along the river toward the Old Holy City. Meanwhile, we will head directly south, crossing the border of Everwinter, and our destination is Wolfheart City."



"Wolf... Heart?" Farrina was taken aback.



"I have made an agreement with the Wolf King, Wulfhram," Grace said frankly, "If I can help him defeat the Church's assault, he will assist me in taking over the entire territory of Everwinter. In this way, if the Church does not withdraw its troops, the fierce snow powder and Styx water loaded on the ships are enough to turn the Old Holy City into a sea of fire—unlike the New Holy City, it is a city without walls. Without gathering enough manpower, it is impossible to stop the slaves' attacks from all directions."



"If they retreat, Wolfheart City will get a breather, and with our countries bordering each other, we can join hands against the Church in the future!"



"Indeed," Queen Clearwater nodded, "And we will be able to secure a foothold in Everwinter as well."
