## New Beichuan
The granite steps of the Eternal Winter King's City Temple were stained red with blood, and the sweet, acrid smell in the air was so intense it was almost suffocating.

Many bodies lay on the ground—there were those of the God's Punishment Army, the believers, our own people, and the Sand People of the Mojin tribe. They all died in different ways, most of them bearing traces of being scorched, with shattered limbs and organs strewn about. Farlyn knew that they had died from the impact and burning of the violent snow powder.

With every step he took, he felt a sticky sensation under his feet. The fighting will of the church's Judgement Army and the believers was simply insane. Faced with the numerous slaves enhanced by drugs, they still did not retreat. Using their bodies as shields, they desperately clung to the enemy, all for the sake of giving their companions a chance to strike a fatal blow—the pills could make one strong and unafraid of pain, but the heart, neck, and head were still vulnerable, and Her Majesty the Queen did not have spare armor to equip these cheap slaves.

If it weren't for the snow powder, the outcome of the battle might have been uncertain.

But we won... Farlyn's heart burned with a fiery passion, we finally won! Queen Clearwater's banner was already flying on the city wall, and even the church's strongest defensive stronghold had not withstood this assault. With this, the Black Sail Fleet was freed from being trapped in a corner of Greycastle, no longer having to be slowly depleted of vitality in the endless war of attrition against Timothy.

The temple hall was just as chaotic, with shattered glass and blood flowing everywhere on the ground, but he paid no attention to these, walking straight to the woman standing in the center of the hall, radiant with energy, and knelt on one knee, "Your Majesty, all four city gates have fallen into the hands of the Black Sail, Eternal Winter King's City is yours now."

"It's been hard on you, rise," Grace extended her hand towards him.

Farlyn gently took the queen's hand, giving a symbolic kiss on the back of her fingers, before standing up and positioning himself beside her.



"Strange etiquette," Kabala suddenly spoke up, "You never even touched her hand, so why put on such a display?"



The question was so abrupt that it made him frown, but since the other party was the chieftain of the Sand Nation, it wouldn't be appropriate to scold her for her rudeness in public. So he replied coldly, "This is a common courtesy among nobles, representing politeness and respect. It would be rude to actually touch. It's quite normal for someone from the Sand People like you to not understand."



"Is that so?" she raised her eyebrow, pointing to the collar around her neck, "We are allies who have just fought together, and right after the battle, you want to put this on me. The courtesies and respects of the mainlanders are indeed puzzling."



Around Kabala's neck was a ring of iron, bulging in the middle, which at first glance appeared to be an ornament, but Farlyn knew it enclosed a Divine Stone of Judgement. Other than a specially made key, it was difficult to unlock the iron collar, and the key was in Grace's possession. The other party was a witch and naturally had to be treated with caution, but she had indeed contributed significantly in the battle. Without her command art, those slaves carrying the explosive snow powder probably wouldn't have dared to charge at the tight defensive line formed by the believers. He opened his mouth but did not know how to retort.



"Alright, let's not argue over such trivial matters," Grace interrupted, "Don't forget why we're here—together. Compared to a vast land of survival, can't you tolerate even a single stone?"



"I was just speaking off the cuff," Kabala shrugged, "I hope you will fulfill your promise."



"Of course, it's the basis of our cooperation," the Queen said with a slight smile.



"What about the Black Sail next?" Farlyn asked.



"The plan for the next step will be discussed later. For now, let's enjoy the show," Grace clapped her hands and instructed her guard, "Bring her up."



Before long, two armored guards escorted a woman with her hands tied behind her back into the sanctuary.

She appeared to be about thirty years old, with ordinary features. Her brown hair was disheveled, draping over her cheeks, and she wore a golden robe of the Church. Such finely made and carefully chosen garments were typically only worn by bishops of the Hermes Church. Now, the lavish robe was torn in several places, with patches of blood around the edges.

"Is this person... a bishop?"

"Yes," Queen Clearwater curled her lips, "I have confirmed with the local nobility, she is one of the Church's three great bishops, Lady Heather." She turned her gaze to the other party, "Am I right?"

"..." Heather did not respond, but Ferlin could see the thick scorn and disdain in her eyes.

Evidently, Grace felt it too, as she chuckled, "I also thought you wouldn't surrender. Thus, with benevolence in mind, I brought you to the sanctuary, to send you back to the divine kingdom here. You can slowly beg for the redemption of the gods, or you can beg me for forgiveness. I will cut off your fingers, limbs, and facial features bit by bit, letting you fully experience the pain and helplessness of the citizens of Clearwater Harbor."

"And then what?" the female bishop unexpectedly spoke, "Be crushed into powder by the Church's army? Or do you plan to drift at sea for a lifetime, never coming ashore?"

"There's no need for you to worry about that," Grace gestured to the guards to proceed, "Compared to that, the Church's army is currently attacking Wolfheart City, and Hermes is like an undefended city, which is far more important than my fate. I might not be able to step on the land of the New Holy City, but I can still manage to reduce the old Holy City on the plains to ruins. You must have heard of the River Styx at the southernmost tip of Greycastle, which ignites easily and is very difficult to extinguish. This time, I brought an entire shipload."

The guards drew their daggers, approached the bishop pressed to the ground, and cleanly severed two of her fingers.



Heather clenched her teeth and did not let out a cry of pain.

Queen Clearwater stepped onto the main staircase of the hall and sat on the broad throne, propping her chin with her right hand, showing an interested expression.

...Again three fingers, by now her left hand had become a bare flesh palm, and Heather's forehead was beaded with large drops of sweat.

"Do you really have to do this?" Kabala shook her head, "If it's not for deterring enemies or extracting information, such pure torture is unnecessary."

"Unnecessary?" Grace laughed, "You should tell her that, do you know how the witches that fall into the hands of the church are treated? I guess you wouldn't be interested in knowing."

"Ha ha ha..." It was at this moment that Heather, who had lost all her fingers, suddenly burst into laughter, "You don't understand the greatness of the church, nor will you understand how important all that the Holy City does is. You always accompany ignorance, yet you are oblivious to the impending destruction! Hermes will show you what true power is—the only outcome for those who oppose the church is destruction!"

"Is that so..." Grace crossed her legs and smiled, "Then I shall wait and see."

Until the Archbishop died, she did not utter a single plea for mercy. But what surprised Farain was that she did not call out to the name of God, hoping for divine salvation either. In the end, as Heather was about to lose consciousness from excessive blood loss, her expression was chillingly indifferent, not as if she was undergoing punishment, but rather as if she was watching an irrelevant farce—through those eyes, Farain felt as if he was seeing his own inevitable future.

This feeling made him feel inexplicably oppressed, almost unable to breathe.



"Chop off her head and hang it at the church entrance," Grace commanded after confirming the death of the bishop. Then she turned to Farien, "Now we can talk about the next plan."

"Yes, Your Majesty," he suppressed the discomfort stirring in his heart, "Do you plan to attack Hermes?"

"Correct, but not with a full mobilization." She spread out a cowhide map she carried with her. "On the Black Sail Fleet, only a minimum number of sailors and some slaves from the Eastern Region will remain to navigate the fleet westward along the river towards the Old Holy City. Meanwhile, we will head directly south, crossing the border of the Everwinter, aiming for Wolfheart City."

"Wolf…heart?" Farien paused.

"I've reached an agreement with Wolf King Wally," Grace said bluntly, "If I can help him fend off the church's assault, he will assist me in taking over the entirety of Everwinter. In this way, if the church does not withdraw its troops, the ship loaded with fierce snow powder and Styx water is enough to engulf the Old Holy City in a sea of flames—unlike the New Holy City, it is a city without walls, and without gathering enough manpower, it's impossible to stop the slaves' attacks from all directions."

"If they retreat, Wolfheart City will have a chance to catch its breath, and with both countries bordering each other, we can join forces against the church in the future!"

"Indeed," Queen Clearwater nodded, "And we will also be able to gain a foothold in Everwinter."
