## Battle of Chaos
"Charge!" Almost at the same moment, Raymond's voice roared out.



Levin stared blankly as Raymond Horace fell from his horse, the back half of his head completely blown open, revealing a sticky mess of red and white. His broken helmet lay to one side, the top split open with a hole as large as a bowl, seemingly having offered no protection.



"Charge, all of you, charge!" Then Levin's voice also rang out.



No, that wasn't right—he hadn't spoken at all! Levin covered his mouth and looked back; the militiamen had already impatiently swallowed their pills and were beginning to run as if a wall of men was surging towards him.



It was the witches, he realized, the witches had imitated his voice. "Don't charge, stop!" he shouted.



However, his voice was like a small splash in the surging tide of people; some heard his command and stopped, but more continued to charge forward.



"Quick, charge, break through the enemy's defenses in the center, the town is yours for the taking!" Not only his voice, but the voices of Dorn and the other knights also rose up as if by agreement, and these voices drowned out all the noise, as if they were screaming directly into one's ear.



Cries erupted from within the ranks, as if in response to this command, with the slogan "Plunder" being chanted by the crowd, one after another. It was unclear who had started it, but it quickly resonated throughout the entire force. The situation was completely out of control, and no matter how much Levin shouted, his voice was drowned out by the excited roars of the people. He had to control his horse with all his might to avoid being swept away by the flood; the militiamen, as if they had lost their senses, surged toward the middle of the road.



No, that wasn't right—they had little sense to begin with, especially when someone was leading them, and after taking the pills, they would enter a state of extreme excitement, where any killing would stimulate them even further. At first, some people avoided the body of Raymond lying on the ground, but later, the crowd simply stepped over his corpse. Levin wanted to find Dorn and the others but realized they had been scattered by the crowd. With no other choice, he had to follow the direction of the troop, gradually moving towards the side of the forest—if he were to suddenly turn his horse sideways, he might be knocked down by the militiamen, whose strength had increased several times, and it would be difficult to get up again.



After breaking away from the troop, Levin looked around, hoping to find the witch responsible for the chaos and tear her to pieces. In his view, this was definitely a witch's conspiracy!



The one thousand five hundred men who had taken the pills swarmed toward the town's defense line, which was also a fatal assault to the prince. Even if the other side had a large number of new weapons, they couldn't withstand so many people, and the final outcome was bound to be grim. Under the circumstances where both sides suffered losses, it was clearly the scenario the witches delighted to see, which is why they would interfere and tempt the army to advance on their own.



"Killing Rayman and causing chaos, it shouldn't be the same witch," he looked at the few militiamen beside him—they were all standing at the very front of the formation, had witnessed Rayman fall, and had heard the command to stop, but compared to the massive army, less than thirty were gradually closing in. "One's ability must be to hide her form, while the other imitates voices. A single witch couldn't possibly possess both abilities. Find the latter for me, I want to tear out her throat with my own hands!"



...



From the shooting window, Brian could see the enemy getting closer and closer, and gunshots had already rung out from the bunkers at the front.



His defensive position was located in the middle of the diamond shape, and he had to wait until the enemy passed the purple marker by the road before he could open fire—this waiting made him anxious.



Walking to the other window, Brian looked back, where white smoke constantly rose from the artillery positions, and loud booms rolled over like thunder. They were the first to get busy, with the range of the twelve-pound cannons covering almost the entire battlefield. If one listened carefully, they could even hear the whistling sound of the cannonballs slicing through the air.



"Good heavens, they're running so fast!"



"Look at that fellow, his arm was blown off by a cannonball, and he's still running forward."



"His Highness is right, are these even humans? They're just like demonic beasts."

As the First Army had been informed before the battle that the enemy were all madmen who had taken the Church's frenzy pills, the sight of them charging into the rain of bullets did not scare anyone; instead, it filled them with fighting spirit—after all, the First Army had grown through combating demonic beasts.

"Captain, they're almost upon us!" someone warned.

Iron Axe quickly returned to his position, propping his rifle out of the window—compared to the old flintlock rifles that needed to be reloaded after every shot, the new weapons given by His Highness were a qualitative improvement; he could fire five bullets in one go, toss the cartridge to the rookie behind him, then continue firing the next five bullets from his reserves, by which time the rookie should have finished reloading.

However, His Highness had emphasized during training that this method of suppressive fire should only be used when the enemy was between one hundred and fifty meters away. When shooting from a distance, accuracy should be prioritized as much as possible because the bullets for the revolving rifles were very troublesome to manufacture, and each person's allocation was limited.

Iron Axe agreed wholeheartedly. The copper casings for the gunpowder were tapered, thicker at the bottom and thinner at the top, and nearly every single one was identical. A blacksmith could never produce such intricate items; he knew they must come from the hands of witches. Normally, everyone would collect the spent casings, handing them over to the Iron Axe, and after shooting practice, there would inevitably be reloading drills. A group would sit around in the center of the camp, following procedures to stuff primers, gunpowder, and bullets into the distributed casings, assembling new ammunition. Therefore, he was reluctant to waste ammo on targets unlikely to be hit.

When the enemy crossed the purple marker, Iron Axe took a deep breath, "Fire at will!"

The soldiers had been waiting for this order and were eager to pull the trigger on their aimed targets. For a moment, the bunker was filled with the sound of gunfire. The first enemies to cross the line were hit by the crisscrossing bullets, blood spurting from their waists, staggering a few steps before falling to the ground. Clearly, they could endure more pain than ordinary people, but they were no match for the large-caliber bullets.

Iron Axe noticed several men jumping onto the top of the front bunker, attempting a sneak attack from behind on the soldiers inside. However, a thick iron door blocked them. Without any hesitation, he turned his gun around and shot each of these exposed madmen. The diamond-shaped arrangement of the bunkers was designed for mutual protection, and any enemy attempting to flank would be met with crossfire from the rear bunker.



"Careful, spears!" someone suddenly shouted.

Iron Axe saw a dense mass of dark shadows burst from the center of the enemy's main force, reaching the apex in the air before plummeting towards the bunker complexes on both sides.

At this distance, it must be two or three hundred meters! He instinctively shrank his head closer to the pit, only to hear a series of crackling sounds above his head. After this wave of attacks, he stood up straight and found that not a single short spear had been thrown into the fort. The situation with the bunkers in front was similar, with only a few short spears stuck in the walls, like lonely feathers.

"It looks quite scary, but it's really useless," the crowd laughed.

Just then, Iron Axe saw an enemy braving a shower of flying dust, advancing towards the bunker he was in, bending his body, and hurling the short spear in his hand. The moment the weapon left his hand, he too was brought down by a hail of bullets.

"Duck!" His warning cry was not yet finished when that very spear coincidentally passed through the shooting window, stabbing straight into the chest of a marksman, who let out a muffled grunt and fell backwards to the ground.
