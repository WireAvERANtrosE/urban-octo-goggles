## Battle of Chaos
"Charge!" Almost simultaneously, Rayman's voice bellowed out.

Levin stared blankly at Rayman Host falling from his horse. The back half of his head was completely blown open, revealing a mix of red and white viscous matter. His shattered helmet lay to the side, with a broken hole the size of a bowl at the top, seemingly offering no protection at all.

"Charge, everyone get on them!" Levin's voice followed.

No, I didn't say anything! Levin covered his mouth and looked behind him. The militiamen had already impatiently swallowed their pills and started running as if a wall of people was surging toward him.

It was a witch, he realized; a witch had mimicked his voice. "Don't charge, stop!" he yelled.

However, his voice was like a small splash in the surging crowd. Some heard his command and stopped, but many more continued to charge forward.

"Quick, charge, break through the enemy's defense in the center, the town is yours for the taking!" It wasn't just his voice; Dorn's and the other knights' voices also rose in unison, and their voices drowned out all the noise as if screaming directly into everyone's ears.

Cries of encouragement erupted from within the ranks, as if in response to this command. Everyone began chanting the slogan "loot," not knowing who started it, but it quickly resonated through the entire team. The situation was completely out of control, and no matter how Levin shouted, his voice was overwhelmed by everyone's excited roars. He had to exert all his strength to control his horse to avoid being swept away by the torrent. The militiamen, as if they had lost their minds, surged toward the center of the road.

No, this was wrong, they hardly had any sense to begin with, especially when someone was leading them on. After taking the pills, they would enter a state of extreme excitement, and any act of killing would stimulate them even further. At first, some tried to avoid Rayman's body on the ground, but soon people were stepping right over his corpse. Levin wanted to find Dorn and the others, but found they had been scattered by the crowd. He had no choice but to go along with the direction of the troop, gradually moving towards the side of the forest—if he suddenly turned his horse sideways, he might be knocked down by the militiamen who had become several times stronger, and by then it would be difficult to get up again.



After breaking away from the troops, Leven looked around, determined to find the witch who caused the chaos and tear her to pieces. In his view, this was definitely a witch's conspiracy!



The fifteen hundred men who had taken the pills swarmed towards the town's defenses. For the prince, this was a deadly assault as well. Even with a large number of new weapons, they could not withstand so many people, and the outcome was bound to be bad. In a situation where both sides suffered, it was obviously a scene the witch would be pleased to see, which is why she meddled and lured the army to advance on their own.



"The witch who killed Raymond and the one causing chaos must not be the same person," he looked at the few militiamen beside him—they were all at the very front of the troops, witnessed Raymond falling, and heard his own orders to stop. However, compared to the massive army, less than thirty were gradually gathering, "One's ability must be to hide their form, and the other is to mimic voices. A witch cannot possess both abilities. Find the latter for me, I want to tear her throat out with my own hands!"



...



Brian could see the enemy getting closer from the shooting window, and the bunker in front had already started to fire.



His defensive position was located in the middle of the diamond, and he had to wait for the enemy to pass by the purple marker beside the road before he could fire—this waiting was agonizing for him.



Walking to another window, Brian looked towards the rear, where white smoke rose continuously from the artillery positions, and the booming sounds rolled over like thunder. They were the first to get busy; the range of the twelve-pound cannons covered almost the entire battlefield. If one listened carefully, they could even hear the whistling of the cannonballs as they cut through the air.



"My God, they're running so fast!"



"Look at that guy, his arm was severed by a cannonball and he's still running forward."



"His Highness is right, are these even humans? They're more like demonic beasts."

Since the First Army was informed before the battle that the enemy had all taken the church's berserk pills, the sight of them charging through the barrage of bullets did not intimidate the soldiers. On the contrary, it filled them with fighting spirit—after all, the First Army had grown by combating demonic beasts.



"Captain, they're almost upon us!" someone warned.



Brian quickly returned to his position and propped his rifle out the window—the new weapons issued by His Highness were a qualitative improvement compared to the old flintlocks that had to be reloaded after each shot. He could fire five bullets in one go, toss the cartridge to the rookie behind him, then continue with another five rounds that had been readied. By that time, the rookie should have reloaded the cartridges.



However, His Highness had emphasized during training that this method of fire suppression should only be used when the enemy approached within one hundred to fifty meters. For long-distance shots, they should aim for higher accuracy because the bullets for the revolving rifles were very troublesome to make, and each person was given a limited supply.



Brian agreed wholeheartedly. The bullet casings, with their tapered shapes—thicker at the bottom and thinner at the top—were all nearly identical. No blacksmith could produce something so delicate; he knew these must have come from the witches. Normally, everyone would collect the spent casings and hand them over to Iron Axe, and after shooting practice, there would be a reloading drill. Gathered around the center of the camp, a group of soldiers would follow the procedures, inserting the primer, gunpowder, and bullet into the distributed casings to assemble new bullets. Therefore, he was also reluctant to waste ammunition on difficult-to-hit targets.



When the enemy crossed the purple markers, Brian took a deep breath, "Fire at will!"



The soldiers had been waiting for this command, eager to pull the triggers on their aimed targets. For a time, the bunker was filled with the sound of gunfire. The first enemies to cross the line of fire were struck by the crisscrossing bullets, blood spraying from their waists, stumbling a couple of steps before collapsing to the ground. Clearly, they could endure more pain than ordinary people, but they were still no match for the large-caliber bullets.



Brian noticed several men jumping onto the top of the front row of bunkers, trying to attack the soldiers inside from behind. However, a thick iron door stopped them in their tracks. Without hesitation, he swung his rifle around and picked off these exposed madmen one by one. The reason for the bunker's diamond-shaped layout was to provide mutual cover, and any enemy attempting to flank would be cut down by the gunfire from the rear bunkers.



"Be careful, spears!" someone suddenly shouted.



Brian saw a dense mass of dark shadows burst out from the center of the enemy's main force. After reaching their peak in the sky, they plummeted toward the bunkers on both sides.



That distance must be two to three hundred meters! He instinctively shrank his head closer into the pit, only to hear a series of cracking sounds above his head. After the volley, he stood upright and saw that not a single short spear had been thrown into the fort. The situation at the front bunker was similar, with only a few short spears stuck in the wall, looking like solitary feathers.



"It looks pretty scary, but it's useless," the people laughed.



Just then, Brian saw an enemy braving a spray of dust approaching the bunker he was in. Bending over, the enemy hurled the short spear in hand. The moment the weapon left his grasp, he was also brought down by a hail of bullets.



"Duck!" His warning had not yet faded when the thrown spear just happened to pass through the firing slot, stabbing straight into the chest of a gunner, who let out a muffled groan and fell backwards onto the ground.
