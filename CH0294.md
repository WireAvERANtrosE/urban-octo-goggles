## Devil's Assault
At dawn, everyone packed up their camping gear and set out once again.

Roland also noticed a detail: even sleeping in the wilderness, the witches' appearances did not show any signs of deterioration, whereas he clearly could not achieve this. Without looking in a mirror, he could guess that his hair must be a mess, his complexion pale due to lack of sleep, and his skin sticky with half-dried sweat, probably looking listless in everyone's eyes. It wasn't until he washed up with drinking water from a skin bag that he alleviated this discomfort.

Roland began to miss the water supply system and the spacious shower room in the castle.



Half an hour later, following Lightning's guidance, the Seagull arrived at the predetermined location—beside the Snow Mountain. Hovering over the vast sea, the group could now see the scenery behind the mountain.



Just as Lightning had described, the area behind the Snow Mountain was shrouded in a red mist, which pressed low and grew more intense the closer it was to the ground. In order to see further, Roland had the hot air balloon continue to rise, gradually unfolding the land at the edge of their view.



"Do you see anything?" he asked Sylvie.



She shook her head, "No, it's too far, beyond the observation range of the Eye of Truth."



"We'll get closer after Soraya has drawn the scene." Roland said.



While Soraya was busy drawing, he also used a telescope to observe the coastline. Aside from cliffs and rocky beaches, there were no man-made structures like docks or shipyards, it seemed that even if there were devils, they had not considered constructing ships to attack Greycastle from the sea. This finding allowed him to breathe a sigh of relief.



As the hot air balloon slowly approached the land, Sylvie finally began to report what she had seen—a cluster of black stone structures, shaped like triangles, very much resembling spires, about ten miles away from the coastline.



"It's just like the mirages seen in the Fertile Plains," Wendy couldn't help but exclaim, "This place is indeed the domain of the devil!"



"But the height is clearly not right," Soria frowned, "The spires in the mirages are hundreds of feet tall, and it's impossible for them to be covered by the Red Mist. They should be taller than the undulating mountains."



"Perhaps what you saw was the city of devils, and this is just a village of devils?" Anna speculated.



So the devils have a complete and unique urban system, belonging to a higher evolved group, and they are also keen on expansion and slaughter? Roland thought to himself, please, let it not be the case, "What is inside those spires?"



"Umm... most of the spires are empty, and some seem to be filled with liquid... wait," Sylvie paused, then said in disbelief, "We need to go, the devils have discovered us!"



"Discovered?" Roland lifted his telescope for a look, but all he saw was dark red, and he couldn't make out anything clearly.



"They're on the move," Sylvie shouted nervously, "Before, they were all buried in the ground, only their tubes sticking out of their backs, and there... a devil has taken to the air!"



"Wendy, full speed retreat!" Roland ordered.



The gale picked up swiftly, and the sudden, significant movement of the hot air balloon caused the basket to tilt, with the taut ropes creaking noisily.



However, Sylvie's warning sent a chill through everyone's heart.



"Two devils are heading towards us, and their mounts can fly!"



Damn it, these guys actually have flying mounts? Roland's eyes widened in disbelief. It defied all reason—how large must a mount be to carry a burly man?



But before long, he caught sight of two black dots in his field of vision. Looking through a telescope, he saw that the mounts under them had sharp beaks and fangs, were completely hairless, and bore no relation to birds. If he wasn't mistaken... these were two mixed-breed demonic beasts!



"Decrease altitude, land as soon as possible," Roland squeezed out a few words through clenched teeth.



This was an oversight; he had not anticipated that the devils could pursue them through the air, and the only one on their side capable of aerial combat was Lightning. But seeing her pale complexion, he knew there was no chance of victory in this fight. Once overtaken, even if the enemy only used ramming attacks against the balloon, it could spell doom for the witches— even if the coating could withstand the demonic beasts' collisions and bites, the severe shaking could very likely fling everyone out of the basket, crashing down onto the sea surface like stones.



At this height, falling into the sea was no different from hitting solid ground.



At this moment, the devils were getting closer to the hot air balloon. Without the need for a telescope, Roland could already see the huge wings of the mixed-breed demonic beasts and the burly enemies on their backs.



"Be careful," Sylvie screamed again, "They are preparing to throw spears!"

Hearing this warning, he suddenly remembered the encounter described by Leaf—this was how the enemy had instantly taken Redflame's life.

He did not see the devil's arm swell in an instant, nor did he see the incoming spear. At the same time Sylvie issued the warning, Anna had already stretched out her hands, controlling the blackfire to unfold into a thin sheet, shielding the front of the basket.

Then there were two loud "bangs."

Anna grunted, stepping back twice, as the blackfire shattered like glass, and only half of the spear's burning iron shaft remained, tumbling down towards the sea.

She had blocked the attack with a dense curtain of blackfire.

The witches all breathed a sigh of relief, except for Roland, who was anxious—such a mode of ability operation would greatly consume Anna's magic power. Back when she was smelting steel, Roland had noticed that if it was just heating or cutting, her immense magic power would hardly run dry. However, once expanded to a macro level, when acting on objects as a dense whole, the consumption of magic power would increase exponentially. For example, using blackfire as a furnace, impeding the steel's overflow from the outer walls would accelerate the exhaustion of magic power, and if she wanted to lift the entire blackfire furnace, even Anna could not sustain it for more than a few minutes.

Clearly, the recent block had consumed a lot of her power, and if it happened two more times, she might not even be able to maintain heating.

The devils seemed to be deterred by this scene as well, not immediately launching a follow-up attack, but swooping past the hot air balloon from both sides, as if waiting for the next time to gather strength. Roland also got his first close-up view of the enemy's fierce appearance—it was exactly the same as in the photographs, with their beastly headgear, eyes covered by red crystal pieces, and a leather tube hanging from the chin, wrapping around the neck to the carapace on their back.



During this time, the witches pulled out their pistols to return fire, but with the swaying gondola, it was nearly impossible to hit a swiftly moving enemy. After firing two rounds of bullets, not a single one hit the target.

Just then, the devil's arms swelled up again, and this time, they opted for a pincer attack from front and behind.

Anna didn't even have time to observe the enemy behind her, the black fire she summoned could only shield one side. Roland clearly saw the devil fling its right arm at her but could not see the trajectory of the flying spear shaft. Almost instinctively, he pushed Anna, who had her back towards him, and then felt as if his shoulder was smashed by a hammer, sending him flying backward and crashing into the gondola wall.

An unbearable intense pain almost tore him apart, followed by a strong dizzy feeling, as if consciousness was slipping away from him.

Roland clenched his teeth and looked sideways, only to see a huge gash on his shoulder— the hole on the back of the gondola explained the force of the blow.

The half of the arm that was completely torn by this attack was lying in a corner of the gondola, and the blood flowing out quickly stained his clothes red.

"No!" Nightingale's heart-wrenching scream was the last thing he heard before losing consciousness.
