## Devils' Assault
At dawn, everyone packed up their camping gear and set off once again.

Roland noticed another detail: even when sleeping in the wilderness, the witches' appearances did not diminish in the slightest, while he obviously couldn't say the same for himself. Without looking in a mirror, he could guess that his hair was a mess, his complexion pallid due to lack of sleep, and his skin sticky with half-dried sweat. He must have looked utterly listless in everyone's eyes. It wasn't until he washed up a bit with the drinking water from his skin that he alleviated some of the discomfort.

Roland began to miss the running water system and the spacious shower room in the castle.



Half an hour later, following Lightning's directions, the Seagull arrived at the designated location—beside the Snow Mountain. Hovering over the vast sea, the group could now see the scenery behind the mountain.



Just as Lightning had described, a red mist enveloped the area behind the snow mountain, pressing low and growing more intense in color closer to the ground. To get a better view, Roland had the hot air balloon ascend further, and the land at the edge of their vision slowly spread out.



"Do you see anything?" he asked Sylvie.



She shook her head. "No good, the distance is too great. It's beyond the observation range of the Eye of True Sight."



"Let's wait for Sorya to sketch the scene before we get any closer," Roland said.



While Sorya was busy drawing, he used a telescope to observe the coastline. Aside from cliffs and stone beaches, there were no man-made structures like docks or shipyards, suggesting that if there were any devils, they had not considered building ships to attack Graycastle from the sea. This observation provided him with some relief.



As the hot air balloon slowly approached the land, Sylvie finally began to report what she saw—about more than ten miles from the seashore, she found a pile of black rocks that formed a structure, triangular in shape, resembling a series of spires.

"Just like the mirages seen in the Barbarian Land," Wendy couldn't help exclaiming, "This place is indeed the devil's territory!"

"But the height is clearly wrong," Soria frowned, "The spires in the mirage rise to a hundred feet, they can't possibly be covered by the red mist; they should be taller than the undulating mountains."

"Maybe what you saw is the city of devils, and this is just a village of devils?" Anna guessed.

So, the devils have a complete and unique urban system, belonging to a higher evolutionary group, and are also keen on expansion and slaughter? Roland thought darkly, please, let it not be so, "What's inside those spires?"

"Umm... Most of the spires are empty, some seem to be filled with liquid... wait," Sylvie paused, then said incredulously, "Move, the devils have discovered us!"

"Discovered?" Roland raised his telescope for a glance, but it was still a dark red, and he could see nothing clearly.

"They're moving," Sylvie shouted nervously, "They were all buried in the ground before, only their back pipes were exposed, over there... a devil is flying!"

"Wendy, full speed retreat!" Roland ordered.



The gale picked up swiftly, causing the hot air balloon to move abruptly and the basket to tilt; the tense ropes creaked and groaned.

However, the warning from Sylvie sent a chill through everyone's hearts.

"Two devils are coming towards us; their mounts can fly!"

Damn it, these guys actually have flying mounts? Roland's eyes widened in disbelief. It defied all reason—how massive must a mount be to carry a burly man?

But it didn't take long before he spotted two black dots in his field of vision. Looking through the telescope, he saw that the mounts under them had pointed beaks and sharp teeth, were hairless, and bore no relation to birds. If he wasn't mistaken... these were two mixed breed demonic beasts!

"Decrease altitude, land as soon as possible," Roland managed to squeeze out the words through clenched teeth.

This was an oversight; he hadn't expected the devils to be capable of aerial pursuit, and the only one on their side who could fight in the air was Lightning. But seeing her pale face, he knew there was no chance of winning this battle. Once caught up, even if the enemy only used their mounts to ram the balloon, it could spell the end for the witches—if the coating could withstand the impact and tearing of the demonic beasts, the violent shaking could very well throw everyone out of the basket, to crash into the sea like stones.

At this height, falling into the water was no different from hitting solid ground.

Now, as the devils drew closer to the hot air balloon, there was no need for a telescope; Roland could see the mixed breed demonic beasts' massive wings and the burly enemies on their backs.



"Careful," Sylvie screamed again, "They're preparing to throw spears!"

Hearing this warning, he suddenly recalled the encounter Ye Zi had described—the enemy had taken Redeye's life in an instant in exactly this manner.

He didn't see the devil's arms swell in the blink of an eye, nor did he see the incoming spears. As Sylvie issued her warning, Anna had already stretched out her hands, controlling the Blackfire to unfold into a thin layer, shielding the front of the basket.

Then there were two loud bangs.

Anna grunted, stumbled back two steps, the Blackfire shattered like glass, and only half of the spear shaft, burning, tumbled toward the sea surface.

She had blocked this attack with a dense curtain of Blackfire.

The witches all breathed a sigh of relief, but only Roland was frantic—such a way of wielding power would greatly deplete Anna's magic. When she was smelting steel, Roland had noticed that if she was merely heating or cutting, her vast magic would hardly diminish. However, once expanded to the macro level, when influencing objects as a dense whole, the consumption of magic would increase exponentially. For example, using Blackfire as a furnace, the outer walls that hindered the overflow of molten steel would accelerate the consumption of magic; if she wanted to lift the entire Blackfire furnace, even Anna couldn't sustain it for more than a few minutes.

Clearly, the recent defense had taken a lot out of her. If it happened two more times, she probably wouldn't be able to maintain even heating.

The devils seemed to be deterred by this scene as well and did not immediately launch a follow-up attack. Instead, they swept past the hot-air balloon from both sides, as if waiting for the next opportunity to gather strength. Roland also got his first close-up view of the enemy's ferocious appearance—they were exactly like the creatures in the photographs, wearing the headgear of malevolent beasts, their eyes covered with red crystal plates, with a leather pipe connected at the chin, looping around the neck to the carapace on their backs.



During this time, the witches pulled out their pistols and returned fire, but hitting a fast-moving enemy while the basket was constantly swinging was nearly impossible. After firing two rounds, not a single bullet hit its target.

Just then, the devil's arms swelled again, and this time, they chose to attack from both front and back.

Anna didn't even have time to observe the enemy behind her; the black fire she summoned could only cover one side. Roland clearly saw the devil swing its right arm at her but couldn't see the trajectory of the spear shaft. Almost instinctively, he pushed Anna, who was facing away from him, and then felt as if his shoulder had been hammered fiercely. He flew backward and crashed into the basket wall.

An unbearable, excruciating pain almost tore through him, followed by intense dizziness. His consciousness seemed to be drifting away from him.

Roland gritted his teeth and looked to the side, only to see a huge gash in his shoulder—the hole in the basket behind him was a clear indicator of the strike's force.

The half of his arm that had been completely torn off by this attack was lying in a corner of the basket, and the blood that was continuously flowing out quickly stained his clothes red.

"No!" Nightingale's heart-wrenching scream was the last thing he heard before losing consciousness.
