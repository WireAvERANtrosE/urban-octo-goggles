## Flesh and blood
Nails' heart suddenly tightened.

In that moment, time seemed to slow down. He prayed for a hit, all the while staring at the gigantic demonic beast without blinking, until he could finally breathe again, only to find the creature still unharmed and continuing its charge.

A few breaths later, a column of snow rose up far behind the monster.

This is bad.

A heavy feeling sank in Nails' heart. Because the giant beast was not heading straight for the sixth section of the wall, there was an angle between it and the cannon, requiring constant adjustment of the cannon's angle while also estimating the creature's speed and firing ahead of time. Otherwise, as had just happened, the cannonball would land behind the target after firing.

According to the rate of fire of the field artillery, they only had one last chance before the monster could breach the wall!

Nails could already see the enemy's thick fur and the gaping maw beneath its sharp fangs. The witches were hurrying over, obviously intending to intercept the beast. But the four of them together were not even as thick as the creature's leg. Could they really do it with just their magic power?

His heart was in turmoil, and he even thought about running to the sixth section of the wall to remind the artillery team to aim forward, but the presence of supervisory team members on both sides of each section of the wall ultimately suppressed this impulse—deserting his post now could be seen as fleeing in the face of the enemy. Iron Axe had emphasized time and again that such actions, which could cause the defensive line to collapse, were absolutely forbidden. Should anyone be discovered doing so, the supervisory team had the authority to shoot to kill on the spot.

The leading demonic beast had already entered the firing range of the revolving rifles, and a series of crackling gunshots rang out from atop the wall.



Nail could only continue to carry out his task, placing the prepared cartridge clips next to the shooters.

At that moment, the second earth-shattering roar rang out, following the long-barreled cannon's previous shot by only three or four breaths of time.

So... fast!? Nail looked towards the sixth section of the city wall in astonishment. The smoke above the barrel had not yet dissipated, and excess smoke was still wafting from the muzzle, like a lit silver pipe. What was even more shocking followed; he didn't even have time to observe whether the shot had hit the enemy before a dazzling flash of light appeared again—

The third bombardment!

Good heavens, don't they need to load ammunition?

He only saw four or five people busily working behind the cannon, but no one ever approached the muzzle. It seemed that this artillery piece was entirely different from those stubby field guns, resembling more a revolving rifle that could fire repeatedly!

And this time, the attack was effective.

Nail didn't see the shell penetrate the monster's body; what first caught his eye was a cloud of blood mist bursting from the side of the giant demonic beast. Scattered in the black blood were torn fur and chunks of flesh. At the same time, the beast shuddered violently, its whole body seemingly deflated somewhat, and ripples surged across its sturdy skin like waves on water—but he wondered if that was an illusion because, in the next instant, the dented body returned to normal. However, the monster's eyeballs were squeezed out in the depression, along with a black and white viscous substance.

Without a deathly roar, the behemoth fell straight to the ground, emitting a dull impact sound. It was only then that Nail noticed where the shell had hit—the creature's body near the neck had a large hole torn into it. Although it seemed insignificant compared to the massive frame, it was difficult to connect this small hole to the fatal blow that had just occurred. Wisps of blue smoke were rising from the hole, while the fur around it had been burned to a charred black.



The monster from hell died just like that?

Nails could not contain the excitement in his heart, transforming his previous worries into a roar of release.

"Long live His Highness!"

Even such a terrifying and fierce enemy could not withstand the powerful weapon invented by Prince Roland! Apart from that new cannon, he couldn't think of any other method that could kill this bulky hybrid demonic beast— even if witches could do it, it wouldn't be as neat and clean. Furthermore, upon reflection, in a certain sense, His Highness had granted them a supreme power that could rival the witches!

This shout was met with more responses, acting like a catalyst, it quickly ignited the emotions of others. At first, the recruits followed in shouting, and then the veterans couldn't help but clench their fists.

Soon after, exuberant cheers erupted from the city walls.

"Long live Prince Roland!"

…

Roland received this news only after the battle had ended.



He donned his woolen coat and hurried to the western section of the city wall, where the massive corpse of the demonic beast still lay quietly in the snow, its black blood melting the surrounding snow into a pool of dark water.

It seems that no matter how terrifying these monsters appear, they are ultimately carbon-based life forms, and in the face of gunpowder and steel, they are no different than thin paper.

This solid pointed bullet tumbled after entering the target's body due to instability, transferring its kinetic energy throughout the target's body, and finally spinning through the torso—as can be seen at the scene, the other side of the target's body was completely blown open, with viscera and broken bones scattered all around, and even the hardest part of the head shattered under the energy shock, collapsing altogether.

However, he also had some worries. The strength of a creature's skeleton has its limits, and this thing was obviously several times larger than an elephant. How did it support its own body without being crushed by its weight? The reason why terrestrial animals are much smaller than marine animals is precisely because of this—gravity is an insurmountable barrier.

Could all this also be related to magic? He remembered Nightingale mentioning that she could see the flow of magic within some of the hybrid demonic beasts.

"This... how is this possible!" Agatha, who had followed him, widened her eyes in disbelief. "Isn't this a Hellbeast?"

"What is that, the name of a hybrid demonic beast?" Roland asked curiously. "Has it appeared on the Fertile Plains before?"

"Yes, when they appear in groups, they are an extremely tricky enemy for both witches and devils. Many towns have been trampled flat by Hellbeasts," Agatha's voice sounded a bit hoarse, "but they are only seen near the coming of the Bloody Moon."

"The Bloody Moon... coming?" Roland suddenly remembered the records from that ancient book, 'When the sky sees the blood-dripped red moon, the gates of hell will open once again.' He frowned, "What does that mean?"



"The records passed down from the first Battle of Divine Will state that it was a time when magic was most abundant. The emergence of witches would reach a peak, but similarly, demons and evil beasts would also become exceptionally powerful," Agatha said anxiously. "I've thoroughly read the history books you gave me, and based on the timeline, there should still be at least twenty to fifty years before the next Bloody Moon. Such monsters shouldn't be appearing now."



"But it has appeared," Roland said gravely. "What does that mean?"



"It means we don't have much time left."
