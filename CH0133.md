## Elk Knight (Part 2)
Before entering the parlor, Primus was searched once again. This time the search was much more thorough, every possible hiding spot for a small knife or dagger from head to toe was checked, not even the soles of his shoes were spared.



Then he met the man who defeated the Duke's allied army in the hall—Grey Castle's Fourth Prince, the Lord of Border Town, and the new ruler of the Western Region, Roland Wimbledon.



This prince had a head of grey hair symbolizing the royal bloodline, and his face looked very young, at most in his twenties. He did not tie up his hair, nor did he wear any crown. His fingers, holding a quill, were slender, and similarly, there was not a single jewel ring or band on his hands, not even a bracelet—this was quite rare among nobles.



"Primus Dassault, a knight of the Elk Earl?" Roland leaned back in his chair, flipping through the list in his hands.



"Yes, Your Highness," Primus knelt on one knee.



It was still hard for him to believe that such a man, with not even a hint of a beard on his face, could lead a group of miners and hunters to defeat the Lion Duke who had long been entrenched in the Western Region.



"Can you read? And write? Stand up to answer."



"I can, Your Highness. These are the most basic requirements for a knight," Primus wobbled to his feet, then suddenly remembered that some older knights were knighted before Grey Castle had popularized the idea of excelling in both literary and martial skills, and added, "I mean, the new batch of knights."



Over the last thirty years, knights who had been ennobled based on martial prowess and military achievements had become increasingly rare, and other considerations had grown as well. Without the ability to pick up a pen to write or read official documents, it was difficult to catch a lord's eye. And with the rise of exceptional young people like the knights of the Chilly Wind of the capital and the Dawn's Light of the Western Region, the requirements for knights had been pushed to a new height.



So now, after becoming a squire, the first thing to learn is reading and writing, and at a higher level, various etiquettes need to be mastered as well.

However, Primus did not understand why His Highness was asking him this question.

"Very well," the prince nodded. "Then I will now pass judgment."

The sentence made him hold his breath momentarily.

"You have two choices: one is to go to the Northern Slope Mine and labor for twenty years to atone for your sins, and the other is to become a teacher, teaching my subjects how to read and write. Miners are not slaves; they receive a salary and can rest three days each month. Teachers not only have a salary but also free housing and can rest two days each week. However, if you choose the latter, you must work until the age of fifty before you can relinquish this position. Rest assured, even if you stop working at that time, your salary will continue to be paid."

After listening, Primus breathed a sigh of relief. As he had previously predicted, there was no execution or exile. However, these two options puzzled him. Working as a miner seemed like hard labor, but His Highness mentioned there was a salary and... holidays? As for being a teacher, wasn't that a role only for those with profound knowledge? He could only read and write. And what did he mean by teaching the subjects? Did His Highness intend to cultivate these commoners as nobles?

The most critical part was that neither choice mentioned what would happen to his own territory.

Primus looked up at the prince and cautiously asked, "Respected Your Highness, may I know what will happen to my territory after I make one of these choices?"

"From the moment you raised your sword against me, your territory no longer belonged to you," Roland said bluntly. "On this matter, I have reached an agreement with the heir of the Elk Family. He will convert the industries within your territory into Gold Royals as compensation for you. After you make your choice, the new Earl will send the compensation along with your family to Border Town, so he can free up new lands to recruit knights."



Primus's heart sank. His domain consisted of nothing more than a house, a flock of chickens and ducks, and the fish in the pond. How much could these things be worth in compensation? The new Earl would surely cut down on the valuation... It would be tough to say if there would even be thirty Gold Royals left. The Earl had just passed away, and his successor had cast Primus aside so ruthlessly, leaving him utterly disappointed.



"As an accomplice to the rebels, this is already a very lenient sentence," Roland paused, "Besides, what's there to regret about a bare domain? Whether you choose to work in the mines or become a teacher, you'll be able to save enough to buy land in Border Town."



Upon hearing this, Primus regained some spirit. He definitely wouldn't consider working in the mines, but as for the other option... "Your Highness, may I ask how much a teacher's salary is?"



"For a junior teacher, it's twenty Silver Royals per month, increasing by five each year until the age of fifty. After fifty, the salary is calculated based on the maximum amount of increase. Also, this right is neither hereditary nor transferable."



Primus did some quick calculations and realized he could earn nearly three Gold Royals a year, with an annual increase to boot. Just four or five years would suffice to catch up with the revenue from his own domain. "Your Highness, what does a junior teacher mean... Are there other types of teachers?"



"Of course, there are. Junior teachers only teach reading and writing, while intermediate and advanced teachers educate in all sorts of subjects, covering everything. As long as one has a unique skill beneficial to the development of Border Town, they can serve as a teacher." Roland sat up straight, "What about you? Do you have any skills you're good at? I have no need for horse riding and swordsmanship."



However, Primus thought, I'm not good at any of these. He hesitated before speaking, "Your Highness, does raising chickens and ducks count? I'm also quite good at fishing." As soon as he said it, he regretted it. These were hardly skills. Left to their own devices, they would survive in the wild. Many nobles kept cats and birds but never specialized in raising such things. As for fishing... it was more of a hobby, just like hunting.



To his surprise, the prince seemed interested in the first part of his statement, "Oh? How do you raise them? Tell me more."



Primus had no choice but to plow on, "Uh, based on my experience raising them on my domain, compared to complete free-range, feeding them some grains every day helps them grow faster. If you mix some sand into the grains, it's equally effective and saves on food. It's best to set up a shelter in a well-ventilated area, which can provide shade, shelter from rain, and keep out the cold. Especially during the hot summers, hens might stop laying eggs without a shelter. In winter, putting straw inside can prevent the chickens from freezing to death. Additionally, feeding them small fish each month means they seldom get sick. Of course, cleaning up the chicken droppings is also very important..."



In the end, he realized that His Highness the Prince had actually begun to smile. "Indeed, it seems the nobles of the Western Region are not entirely useless."



"Your Highness?" Primus was uncertain about the meaning behind the other's words.



Fortunately, Roland Wimbledon quickly alleviated his worries, "I will send someone to purchase a batch of chickens and ducks from Longsong Stronghold, and also allocate a plot of land west of the border for you to raise these poultry. If you do well, you will then teach the breeding methods to others. The salary will be based on that of a mid-level teacher, starting at 50 Silver Royals per month in the first year, with an increase of 10 Silver Royals each year. Of course, if you fail, the Northern Slope Mine will be your only option."
