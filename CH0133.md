## Elk Knight (Part 2)
Before entering the reception room, Pries was searched once more. This search was much more thorough, as every possible place that could hide a small knife or dagger was felt, including the soles of his shoes.



Afterward, he met the man who defeated the Duke's allied army in the hall—Greycastle's fourth prince, the lord of Border Town, and the new ruler of the Western Territory, Roland Wimbledon.



This prince had a head of gray hair, which signified his royal lineage, and looked very young, barely in his twenties. He didn't wear his hair tied back, nor did he wear any crown. His fingers, holding a quill pen, were slender, and likewise, there were no jewel rings or signet rings on his hands, not even a bracelet—which was quite rare among nobility.



"Pries Dihr, knight of Count Elk?" Roland leaned back in his chair, flipping through a list in his hands.



"Yes, Your Highness," Pries knelt on one knee.



He still found it hard to believe that such a man, with not even a whisker on his face, could lead a bunch of miners and hunters to defeat Duke Ryan, who had long been entrenched in the Western Territory.



"Do you know how to read and write? Stand up and answer."



"I do, Your Highness. It's the most basic requirement for a knight," Pries said as he shakily stood up, then he suddenly remembered that some older knights had been conferred before Greycastle had popularized the concept of excelling both in literature and martial skills, so he added, "I mean, the new batch of knights."



In the last thirty years, the number of knights conferred for martial prowess and military achievements had become increasingly rare, with other considerations growing in importance. If one could not write with a pen or read official documents, it was difficult to be favored by a lord. And with the rise of exceptional young people like the knights of the Roaring Wind in the capital and the Dawn's Light of the Western Territory, the requirements for knights had been pushed to new heights.



So after becoming an Apprentice Knight, the first thing to learn is reading and recognizing words, and at a higher level, mastering various etiquettes is also necessary.

However, Pres didn't understand why His Highness would ask him this question.

"Very well," the prince nodded, "I will now pass judgment."

His breath hitched at those words.

"You have two choices: one is to go to the North Slope Mine and work for twenty years to atone for your sins; the other is to become a teacher and instruct my subjects in reading and writing. Miners are not slaves, they also receive wages, and can rest three days each month. Teachers not only have salaries but also free housing, and can rest two days every week. However, if you choose the latter, you must work until the age of fifty before you can relinquish this position. Rest assured, even if you stop working then, your salary will continue to be paid."

After hearing this, Pres slightly relaxed. As he had previously guessed, there was no execution or exile. However, these two options puzzled him. Being a miner sounded like hard labor, yet His Highness mentioned wages and... holidays? As for a teacher, wasn't that a role only for the learned? He could barely read and write. And what did he mean by instructing the subjects—did His Highness intend to cultivate these commoners like nobles?

Most importantly, neither choice addressed what would happen to his own fief.

Pres looked up at the prince and cautiously asked, "Your Highness, may I know what will become of my fief after I make one of these choices?"

"From the moment you raised your sword against me, your fiefdom ceased to belong to you," Roland said bluntly, "On this matter, I have come to an agreement with the heir of the Elk Family. He will convert the assets in your fiefdom into Gold Royals as compensation for you, and after you make your choice, the new Earl will send the compensation along with your family to Border Town, so he can clear out the new place to recruit knights."



Pres' heart sank. There was nothing much in his domain but a house, a flock of chickens and ducks, and the fish in the pond. How much compensation could those things be worth? The new Count would surely cut it down even further... It was uncertain whether he could even get thirty Gold royals by the end. The Count had just died, and his heir had cast him aside in such an unfeeling manner, leaving Pres deeply disappointed.



"As an accomplice to the traitors, this is a very lenient sentence," Roland paused, "Besides, what is there to regret over a barren domain? Whether you choose to go down the mines or become a teacher, you can save enough to buy land in Border Town."



Hearing this, Pres regained some spirit. He would certainly not consider working in the mines, but as for the other option... "Your Highness, may I ask how much a teacher's salary is?"



"For a junior teacher, it's 20 Silver royals per month, increasing by 5 Silver royals every year, until the age of fifty. After fifty, the salary is calculated at the maximum rate of increase. Incidentally, this right cannot be inherited or transferred."



Pres did some quick mental calculations and found that the annual income was nearly 3 Gold royals, and it would increase year by year. In just four or five years, it would almost match the revenue from his domain. "Your Highness, what does 'junior teacher' mean... Are there other categories of teachers?"



"Of course. A junior teacher only teaches reading and writing, while intermediate and senior teachers instruct in all subjects comprehensively. Anyone with a skill beneficial to the development of Border Town can hold the position." Roland sat up straight, "So, do you have any skills you excel in? I have no need for horse riding or swordsmanship."



However, Pres thought to himself that he was not proficient in these. He hesitated before speaking, "Your Highness, does raising chickens and ducks count? I'm also quite good at fishing." As soon as he said it, he regretted it. Those hardly counted as skills; left in the wild, they would survive on their own. Many nobles kept cats and birds, but no one specialized in raising such things. As for fishing... it was more of a hobby, like hunting.



To his surprise, the prince showed interest in the first part of his statement, "Oh? How are they raised? Do tell."



Pres had no choice but to continue, albeit reluctantly: "Er, based on my experience raising them in my domain, compared to completely free-range, supplementing their diet with some grains each day helps them grow faster. If you mix some sand in with the grain, the effect is the same and you can save on feed. It's best to set up a shed in a well-ventilated area to provide shade, shelter from rain, and protection from the cold. Especially during the hot summers, if there is no shed, the hens are likely to stop laying eggs. In winter, putting straw inside can prevent the chickens from freezing to death. Additionally, feeding them small fish each month means the flock rarely falls ill. Of course, cleaning up the chicken droppings is also very important..."



In the end, he found that the prince had actually smiled. "Not bad, it seems the nobility of the Western Region isn't completely useless."



"Your Highness?" Pries couldn't quite grasp the meaning behind his words.



Fortunately, Roland Wimbledon quickly alleviated his concerns. "I will send someone to buy a batch of chickens and ducks from the Longsong Stronghold, and at the same time, I will designate a piece of land west of the border for you to raise these poultry. If you do well, you can pass on the breeding methods. Your salary will be calculated as that of an intermediate teacher, starting at 50 silver royals per month for the first year, with an increase of 10 silver royals each year. Of course, if you fail, the North Slope Mine will be your only option."
