## Witch Maisie
Ashes sat at the top of the castle, waiting for the day of the duel to arrive.

These past few days, her persuasion had made no progress. The stubbornness of the witches from the Witch Cooperation Association greatly exceeded her expectations. Whether it was the older Scroll or the underage Lily, all refused her invitation, with the only difference being their methods of refusal.

Some chose to stay because of Roland, while others did not want to leave their sisters in the Association, resulting in the ten witches being as united as a slab of iron. As for Anna and Nana, who were originally from Border Town, she didn't even feel like attempting to persuade them. Especially the former—when Ashes stood in front of her, she sensed a magic power that was completely different from that of other witches—Anna's magic was like hard steel, smooth and dense, forming an iron wall between them.

Among the many witches gathered by Tilly, none had ever given her such a feeling. According to what she had learned from other witches, Anna's ability was the very ordinary control of flames. Yet, why did the intangible flames create a barrier in magic power that felt so substantial? Ashes was baffled.

As for the town itself, it was also quite different from any city or village she had ever seen. If she had to describe it, it was full of vitality, and it seemed like the people had endless work to do every day.

From the top of the castle, she could overlook the entire town. The most crowded place in the town center was under construction for new houses; they called the neatly planned area a district, and the houses in each district were very similar to one another. The horse-drawn carriages transporting bricks from the north never stopped. The stonemasons would dig out about a dozen pits of the same size all at once, then start piling bricks and building. The speed of construction was astonishingly fast; almost half a person's height of enclosure could be built in just one day.

And looking toward the northeast, thick smoke billowed straight into the sky—not from a forest fire, but from the brick kiln at work. Several particularly stout brick towers were also being erected, which at a glance, looked very much like giant redwoods that had been cut down.

By the river dock, several sailboats arrived at Border Town every day. Judging by the flags hanging from their masts, most of the sailboats came from Longsong Stronghold. The goods unloaded from the ships almost filled the storage yard, and around the yard, a team of guards with wooden spears patrolled. Unlike the guards in most cities, they did not walk lazily or find a place to hide and nap; instead, they lined up straight from beginning to end, moving between the dock and the storage yard, sometimes even taking the initiative to help unload the goods. In Ashes' memory, this was an utterly unprecedented scene.

What magic did Roland Wimbledon possess to inspire such enthusiasm among his subjects for building a remote and barren town?



Just then, a cooing of pigeons came from above. Ashes looked up to see a huge fat pigeon descending from the sky, landing on her shoulder.

"I've finally found you, coo." The pigeon nuzzled her cheek.

"Did Tilly send you?" Ashes took out a handful of wheat from her pocket and threw it on the rooftop.

The pigeon fluttered over to the wheat and suddenly seemed to realize something, "I'm not a bird, coo!"

"Then turn back into a human and talk to me."

"Alright, coo." As soon as she finished speaking, the pigeon's feathers suddenly puffed up, a white light shone through the gaps, and then a head emerged. The expanding feathers quickly contracted and turned into a long strand of white hair.

No matter how many times she saw it, Ashes always found it amazing. Maggie, a witch who could transform into various birds, was perfect in every detail except for being a size larger. Sometimes Ashes even envied her ability; rather than her extraordinary magic power that was immune to the God's Punishment Stones, she longed for the ability to travel quickly between places. That way, whenever she wanted to see Tilly, she could set off anytime, anywhere.

"Even with the tracking sigil, it's not easy to pinpoint your direction," Maggie shook off the down sticking to her, "When the distance is too far, my magic stone statue can hardly feel the sigil's fluctuation. Fortunately, Nightingale knew your approximate whereabouts. I've been flying past Dragon Cliffs City, and only then did this statue start to react."

Aside from her signature white hair, her most distinguishing feature was her short stature; she was of age, yet she only reached up to Ashes' waist, and her appearance was that of a little girl. If she let down her white hair, it could almost wrap around her entire body.



"Has Tilly arrived safely in the Fjords?" Ashes sat down and patted the tile beside her. The other party, like a bird, obediently snuggled over.



"The 'Queen' she took arrived smoothly, but the second ship, 'Northwind', touched a reef while docking. Fortunately, no witches were harmed. The third and the fourth ships are still at sea; I flew over their heads when I came to find you."



"That's good to hear." Ashes was relieved. Prince His Highness might be loathsome in appearance, but he wasn't wrong about one thing—the voyage from Greycastle to the Fjords was fraught with danger. The climate at sea changed much more rapidly and violently than on land; a clear sky could give way to a storm in the blink of an eye, and beneath the overwhelming waves, extraordinary powers seemed trivial.



"You all say the same thing," Maggie spread her hands, "Shadow said that you didn't return with them because you wanted to go to Border Town to rally more witches, not because there was a problem. The first thing Lady Tilly said was also 'That's good'." She paused and looked around, "Where are the others? Where are they?"



"They didn't want to leave," Ashes sighed and briefly recounted what had happened, "They trust the lord of this place more than me, who is Tilly's brother."



"Lady Tilly is willing to accept us, and her brother is willing to accept us too... Hmm, that doesn't seem bad at all, coo," she cocked her head, "In that case, you should set off for the Fjords earlier. Without your help, Lady Tilly can't carry out the sweeping plan."



Ashes shook her head, "I will leave after the contest."



"But you just said that even if you win, the other party won't actively drive the witches away," Maggie muttered, "So, you still want to complete the contest?"



"If there's even a slight chance, I want to try," Ashes said calmly, "Delaying the sweeping plan for a few days won't matter, but if I can bring back one more witch, Tilly's strength will increase considerably."



"Alright," Maggie nodded, "then I'll wait here for you to return together. But there's one thing to note, when passing by Dragon Cliffs City, I saw a group of about ten people holding the flag of the Church."

"Not many people... Holding a flag, they should be an emissary group," Ashes snorted coldly, "Apart from Border Town, I can't think of any other place nearby that would require the Church to send an emissary group. Their noses are as sensitive as dogs'. Good, after I defeat his knight cleanly and decisively, I'll tell him the news of the Church's approach. By then, Roland Wimbledon will realize how terribly wrong he was."
