## Witch Macy
Ashes sat at the top of the castle, waiting for the day of the duel to arrive.

In these past few days, her persuasion had made no progress; the obstinacy of the witches from the Witch Union greatly exceeded her expectations. Whether it was the elder Scroll or the underage Lily, both had refused her invitation. The only difference was the manner of their refusal.

Some chose to stay because of Roland, while others did not want to leave the sisters of the Witch Union, resulting in ten witches as united as a sheet of iron. As for Anna and Nana, who already belonged to Border Town, she did not even feel like trying. Especially the former—when Ashes stood before her, the magic she felt was completely different from any other witch she had encountered before. The magic within Anna was like tough steel, smooth and dense, forming a wall of iron between them.

Among the many witches gathered by Tilly, none had ever given her such a sensation. When she inquired with other witches, she learned that Anna's ability was the very common manipulation of fire. Why the intangible flames translated into a barrier of magic that felt so tangible was beyond Ashes' understanding.

As for this town, it was also quite different from any other town or village she had seen before. If she had to describe it, it was full of vitality, and the people seemed to have endless tasks every day.

She could survey the entire town from the top of the castle. In the town center, where the crowd was densest, new houses were being constructed. They called the neatly planned land "districts," and the houses in each district were more or less the same. The carriages transporting bricks from the north never stopped, and the stonemasons first dug out a dozen identical pits, then began to lay bricks and build. The speed of construction was astonishingly fast, with walls half a person's height appearing in just a day.

Looking to the northeast, thick smoke billowed into the sky—not from a forest fire, but from working brick kilns. Several especially stout brick towers were under construction, and at a glance, they looked like redwood trees that had been cut down.

By the riverside docks, several sailboats arrived at Border Town every day. Judging from the flags hanging on their masts, most of them came from Longsong Stronghold. The goods unloaded from the ships nearly filled the storage yard, and a group of guards armed with wooden spears patrolled around it. Unlike the guards in most cities, who would walk lazily or even find a place to hide and nap, they marched in a straight line back and forth between the docks and the storage yard from beginning to end, sometimes even taking the initiative to help with unloading the cargo. In Ashes' memory, this was a scene she had never seen before.

What kind of magic did Roland Wimbledon possess that could inspire such passion in his subjects to build a remote and barren town like this?



Just then, a series of cooing bird calls came from above. Ashes looked up, only to see a huge, fat pigeon descending from the sky and landing on her shoulder.

"I've finally found you, coo." The pigeon nuzzled her cheek.

"Did Tilly send you?" Ashes took out a handful of wheat from her pocket and scattered it on the rooftop.

The pigeon flapped its wings eagerly and dived towards the wheat, then suddenly seemed to realize something, "I'm not a bird, coo!"

"Then turn into a human and talk to me."

"Alright, coo." As soon as the words were spoken, the pigeon's feathers suddenly puffed up, and a white light shone through the gaps. A head poked out, and the expanding feathers quickly contracted, turning into a long bundle of white hair.

No matter how many times she saw it, Ashes couldn't help but marvel. Maggie, a witch who could transform into various birds, was exquisitely detailed in her transformations, except for being a bit larger in size. Sometimes Ashes even envied her ability. Instead of the extraordinary magic that was immune to the Divine Stone of Judgement, she longed to be able to travel quickly between places. That way, she could set off to see Tilly anytime, anywhere.

"Even with a tracking mark, it's not easy to locate your direction," Maggie shook off the down sticking to her body, "When the distance is too great, my magic stone sculpture can hardly feel the mark's fluctuation. Fortunately, Nightingale knew your general direction. I've been flying over the Fallen Dragon Ridge, and only then did this sculpture start to react."

Besides the distinctive bundle of white hair, Maggie's most noticeable feature was her petite stature. Though she was of age, she only reached up to Ashes' waist, and her appearance was that of a little girl. If she let down her white hair, it could almost completely envelop her body.



"Has Tilly arrived safely at the fjord?" Ashes sat down and patted the tile beside her. The other party, like a bird, obediently moved closer.



"She arrived smoothly on the Queen's, but the second ship, the Northwind, hit a reef while docking. Fortunately, no witches were harmed. The third and fourth ships are still at sea; I flew over them when I came to find you."



"That's good." Ashes was relieved. His Highness the Prince, despite his detestable face, wasn't wrong about one thing—the journey from Greycastle to the fjord is filled with danger. The ocean's weather is far more rapid and violent than on land; a clear sky can turn into a storm in the blink of an eye, and under the overwhelming waves, even extraordinary power seems insignificant.



"You all say the same thing," Maggie spread her hands, "Shadow said you didn't return because you wanted to persuade more witches to come to Border Town, not that there was a problem. The first thing Tilly said was also 'That's good.'" She paused and looked around, "Where are the others? Where are they?"



"They didn't want to leave," sighed Ashes, briefly explaining what happened, "They trust the local lord here more than me, who is Tilly's brother."



"Tilly is willing to accept us, and her brother is willing to accept us... Hmm, that doesn't seem so bad, coo," she tilted her head, "In that case, you should set off for the fjord sooner. Without your help, Lady Tilly won't be able to start the sweeping plan."



Ashes shook her head, "I will leave after the duel."



"But you just said that even if you win, the other party won't actively drive the witches away," Maggie muttered, "So you still want to complete the duel?"



"If there's even a slight chance, I want to try," Ashes said calmly, "Delaying the sweeping plan for a few days is not significant, but if I could bring back one more witch, Tilly's strength would be greatly enhanced."



"Alright," Maggie nodded, "then I'll wait here for you to return together. But there is one thing to note, when passing by the Dragon Ridge, I saw a group of about ten people carrying the church's flag."

"Not many people... carrying a flag, they must be an envoy," Ashes snorted coldly, "Apart from Border Town, I can't think of any other place nearby that needs an envoy from the church. Their noses are as sensitive as dogs'. Good, after I cleanly defeat his knights, I'll tell him the news that the church is coming. By then, Roland Wimbledon will realize just how wrong he was."
