## The Heart's Fire (Part 2)
The day after Anna woke up, Nightingale said her farewells to Roland.



"Although I don't know the reason, she's probably the first witch to have safely passed her Awakening Day," Nightingale said excitedly before leaving. Having been with Roland for some time, she had also started to use the term "awakening" to describe the transformation of witches, "I will bring the sisters from the Witch Cooperation Association, and I hope you can accept them just as you have accepted Anna."



Roland couldn't ask for anything better. With just one Anna, they had surpassed the hot forging process and saw the dawn of the industrial era in the small town. What would a bunch of witches mean? Of course, considering safety issues, he still tried to retain her, hoping she would go to the Impassable Mountain Range after the Evil Months ended.



But Nightingale clearly couldn't wait any longer, "This winter, many more will face this difficult threshold. If we can inform them sooner, maybe fewer will leave us. Don't worry, ordinary demonic beasts can't detect my whereabouts."



"When is your Awakening Day, then?" Roland asked at last.



Nightingale swung herself onto the horse, "At the turn of winter and spring," she waved her hand, leaving the prince with her silhouette, "Don't worry about me, that kind of pain has been fading more and more over the years."



This answer gave Roland something to ponder.



He had also been thinking about the reasons why Anna could pass her Awakening Day so smoothly. After all, Anna said that she hadn't felt any pain afterward, which completely overturned Nightingale's notion—that a witch's power came from devils and was inherently evil and unclean. This was precisely the kind of rhetoric that arose from the belief, and the dreadful state of blood evaporating and skin charring at death became the irrefutable proof of the corrupt power.



However, Roland had never thought in that direction from the beginning.



He had searched through the fourth prince's memories and found no evidence of the existence of true gods or devils in this world. Since power was not a gift from the gods, it should not be used as a standard to distinguish between good and evil. In fact, even in those worlds where the gods frequently interfered with the mortal realm, it was the believers who first chose their camp, and then they were endowed with divine power, not the other way around.



According to Nightingale's description, witches were the convergence of magical power. Could it be that the inability to release this power caused damage to the container itself? Roland thought this possibility was high. Witches were subjected to hostility and suppression by most people, which would inevitably lead them to hide their abilities and live cautiously as normal people. This meant they rarely had the chance to use their magic before reaching adulthood.



Roland certainly did not think that his castle was a place of geomantic treasure. He had asked Anna, and learned that before this, she had also gone through unbearable pain. If there was anything different about this year, it was that since she came to the castle, she had been using this power almost every day.



And Nightingale's final answer subtly confirmed his guess—the ability to become invisible, even if used frequently, would not attract attention. Coupled with the fact that she had been forced to train this ability, she now used it with even less restraint, which is why the backlash of her awakening day had so little effect on her.



Upon returning to the castle, Roland immediately intensified Nana's training. If there were no injured on the front lines, she had to heal various small animals. If this hypothesis could be confirmed through Nana, it would be an earth-shattering revelation for witches; the devil's curse would become a blessing from the heavens. As long as he could ensure that his territory maintained an open attitude towards witches, they would continue to converge there without end.



In any case, after the commotion, everything returned to the right track.



Roland began to accelerate the production of the Steam Engine Mark II, which was also a process for Anna to familiarize herself with her new abilities.



Another shed was erected in the castle's backyard, only this time it was to shield from the wind and snow. As an experimental base, he felt it was safer to build it on his own land for the time being.



According to Nightingale, a witch's abilities would stabilize after reaching adulthood, and there was a possibility of developing new branch abilities. He had not yet seen Anna demonstrate any new abilities, but her use of fire had completely changed from before.



No, whether it could even be called a flame was in question... Roland thought, if the flames before were still within the realm of common sense, the current azure flame had surpassed what common sense could explain.



He named it "Heartflame."



Because it could exist separately from Anna and at the same time, change its form influenced by Anna's will. Just like what she was doing now—

A tiny flame stood on an iron plate two meters away from her, swaying slightly back and forth, as if greeting her. But Roland knew that it was Anna who was controlling it. Normally, it could maintain a temperature close to that of a human body, only increasing to a higher point instantly when Anna wished to raise the temperature, changing its color from azure to dark green. Similarly, it could change from a single flame to a large cluster of fire, and could also move slowly at a slower pace.



Unfortunately, it could never be too far from Anna; after repeated testing, once it was more than five meters away, the Heartflame would disappear.



Another feature of the Heartflame was that Anna could summon multiple flames—though she could currently only manage to manipulate two at the same time.



The recent situation at the border had been calm. Demonic beasts continued to appear outside the city walls sporadically, but there were no mixed breeds, and ordinary demonic beasts found it hard to break through the defenses. Just as Roland had said, the strong got stronger, the fast got faster, but they were still just beasts. A large section of the wall had been built, directing them towards the central section, which even the militia force, numbering just over a hundred people, could handle.



Therefore, apart from the daily routine patrols, Roland had plenty of time to spend on construction.



He had already marked out a piece of land on the south side of the castle, planning it to be the living area for the witches upon their arrival. As the investor of the project, he appointed Karl as the person in charge, to construct a batch of double-story brick houses there. At the same time, issues such as aesthetic and rational layout, convenient access, and quick drainage had to be considered, with the goal of turning it into a model community.



He had also considered whether to disperse the witches into the new and old districts of the town and have them live among the townspeople. However, after some thought, he gave up on this plan. Although doing so would help accelerate the citizens' understanding of the witches, if any problems arose before the misunderstandings were completely cleared, the consequences could be irreparable. After all, the witches only had a certain influence within the militia.



Moreover, Roland could not guarantee that all the witches brought by Nightingale were harmless and pure—most of them had suffered greatly and endured many hardships in the world, and it was probably no longer appropriate to describe them as simply innocent. Witches like Anna and Nana would only be a very small minority.



Therefore, centralized living also facilitated centralized management. He had to draft relevant regulations and rules before their arrival. In this regard, Roland had no experience to reference; after all, he wasn't a member of the National Security Bureau's Supernatural Office, nor was he the creator of the Avengers Alliance—who would know how to manage a group of people with supernatural abilities! He could only start by tentatively establishing a basic system according to general corporate human resource management methods, and then slowly figure things out as he went along.



Roland was, of course, aware that this plan was full of loopholes, but as a pioneer, if he didn't do it, who would? Hiding with his tail tucked in this remote little town, it might take decades just to barely touch the threshold of industrialization, but he was not an immortal cultivator—how many decades did he have?



To lead an era forward and stand at the forefront of reform, one must have a spirit of adventure.



As he was recording these thoughts onto parchment, Barov pushed the door open and came in.



He shook the snowflakes from his clothes, and after saluting the prince, he said, "Your Highness, an envoy from Longsong Stronghold has arrived."
