## Battle line
Iron Axe entered the hall and gave a standard military salute.



"Timothy's troops are expected to arrive at the Redwater River fork in four days, so the First Army has to set off this afternoon," Roland instructed succinctly. "The troops stationed in Border Town will meet up with you at the interception point, and I will also rush over as soon as possible."



"Doesn't the town need defenses?"



"The enemy's every move is under the surveillance of Lightning and Maggie, so there's no need to divide our forces for defense. We just need to concentrate our strength and crush them head-on," the prince paused for a moment, "Moreover, the Longsong Stronghold needs to retain a hundred men to guard those nobles."



"Stay... here?" Iron Axe was slightly taken aback.



Roland briefly recounted the orders he had issued to the five major families, "The reason I've gathered them is precisely to facilitate surveillance. Knowing that Timothy is attacking the Western Territory, we can't guarantee that some won't get any ideas. The Second Army's weapons are outdated and they lack combat experience; they might not respond quickly enough in an emergency. But with ten squads of First Army soldiers, we can ensure that they won't stir up any trouble. I don't want any chaos breaking out behind us while we are engaged in battle at the Redwater River fork."



"Understood, Your Highness," he responded.



"Are you going as well?" Nightingale appeared from behind the main seat after Iron Axe had left.



"Of course," Roland spread his hands, "Who else could make good use of Lily's powers if not me? I might not be the best at commanding battles, but when it comes to sealing tunnels with bunkers and slapping faces with tanks, that's my specialty."



"I understand bunkers, but what's a tank?" Nightingale looked puzzled.



"Uh... it's a carriage that drags cannons," the prince coughed twice, "but we don't have enough horses, so the cannon needs to be transported by the Seagull, which means it can't be called a tank."



"So that's why you chose Honey?" She blinked, "As far as I know, she can tame tigers and leopards to be as docile as horses. But can a cannon pulled by beasts also be called a tank?"



"Of course," Roland couldn't help but curl the corners of his mouth, "It can also be directly called the Tiger and Leopard models."



As they were speaking, Carter came in with a white-tailed kite, "Your Highness, there's news from Border Town."



Roland clapped his hands, and the white-tailed kite, as if sentient, spread its wings to break free from the knight's embrace and soared into the air. After gliding a distance, it landed steadily on his shoulder. He took out a piece of jerky from his pocket for the bird to swallow, and it conscientiously lifted a claw to make it easier for him to untie the cloth strip tied around it.



This kite was not one transformed by Maggie, but one of the aerial messengers trained by Honey. They could remember five to six different people and hundreds of flight routes. As long as they were brought to a strange place, they could establish contact with their home nest. This time, for his journey to the fortress, Roland brought four messengers, which could travel between the two places within an hour and fly non-stop for an entire day. Without radio, this was already the fastest method of communication available.



Roland unfolded the letter wrapped in the cloth strip and quickly scanned it.



The sender was Wendy. She had, according to her instructions, taken Lily, Sylvie, Leaf, Hummingbird, and Nana to the confluence of the Redwater River. Accompanying the ship were also some members of the Artillery Battalion and eight cannons — this was the maximum number of cannons the deck of the Seagull could accommodate after being lightened.



The prince estimated in his mind that it would take a whole day for the cement boat to reach its destination when Wendy drove the sails at full speed. Although Sylvie was there to navigate, allowing the ship to sail at night, Wendy's magic power was far from as abundant as Anna's, and she could not continuously use her ability without rest. Therefore, if they rested at night and transported during the day, it would take four days just for two round trips, and at most, sixteen field guns could be transported to the river fork.



Although the number was not as many as in the last battle, considering the surprise attack and the enemy's inability to quickly counterattack on the ship, the artillery fire was barely sufficient. Roland took the pen and paper handed over by Nightingale and wrote down new orders—commanding the garrison troops to carry weapons and ammunition and depart immediately, to meet up with Iron Axe's main force at the river fork.



It would take only half an hour for the White Falcon to deliver the letter to Scroll, who would then pass it on to Captain Brian.



...



Roland arrived at the predetermined location the next morning.



The sparkling river water split into two at this point—one flowing towards Longsong Stronghold and the other connected to Redwater City.



Since the latter had a broader river surface, people were accustomed to considering it the main channel of the Redwater River, with the one leading to the stronghold being called Little Redwater.



After disembarking, the witches who had been waiting for a long time by the river came forward to greet him.



"Where's Wendy?" Roland looked around and asked.



"Dawn broke and she returned aboard the 'Town' ship," Leaf said. "She mentioned there was another batch of cannons to be transported."

"Are you planning to confront Timothy Wimbledon, the false king who hunts witches day and night in the city?" asked Lily eagerly. "What do you want us to do?"

Even though Iron Axe and the main forces of the First Army had not yet arrived, the preliminary preparations could begin in advance—as long as there were witches.

"I need to establish defenses on both sides of the main river channel," he crouched down and drew a simple diagram with stones, "If this line represents the enemy's route of advance, then my troops will be distributed along both banks to launch a sudden pincer attack. To take them by surprise, they must first be hidden. Therefore, I want two earth houses raised on the bank, forming a V-shape angle. The houses should be elongated, with thick walls, divided into eight compartments, and only a small window on the side facing the Redwater River."

"Your Highness, I don't quite understand..." Lily said, puzzled. "Hiding the soldiers in the earth houses would conceal their movements, but they wouldn't be able to attack the ships on the river. What if the false king's fleet doesn't stop or come ashore and just sails past?"

"No, they won't be able to," Roland said with a smile. "You'll see when the time comes."

Then he turned to Leaf, "You are responsible for camouflaging these works. Weeds and vines will do, just make them look more natural."

"Yes," replied Leaf.

In this way, when the cannons were pushed into the camouflaged works, the two earth houses, which in Lily's eyes seemed pointless, would instantly transform into "Sail Battleships" that would never sink. Then, lifting the covers on the windows, each compartment could spit out deadly flames. Sixteen field guns would not lose their aim due to jolting; in fact, at such close range, they could hit the sailing ships in the middle of the river channel even with their eyes closed—not enough to sink them, perhaps, but certainly enough to turn their decks into a bloody battlefield.



Moreover, from the very beginning, the enemy was in a disadvantageous T-shaped formation. Roland thought smugly, how could the Tilly's Outstanding Knights lose with such an advantage?
