## Battle line
Iron Axe entered the hall and gave a standard military salute.



"Timothy's troops are expected to arrive at the fork of the Redwater River in four days, so the First Army will set out this afternoon," Roland instructed straightforwardly. "The troops stationed in Border Town will rendezvous with you at the point of engagement, and I will hurry over as soon as possible."



"Doesn't the town need defenses?"



"The enemy's every move is under the surveillance of Lightning and Maggie. There's no need to divide our forces for defense; we just need to concentrate our strength and crush them head-on." The prince paused for a moment. "Moreover, we need to leave a hundred men behind at Longsong Stronghold to watch over those nobles."



"Stay... here?" Iron Axe was slightly taken aback.



Roland briefly summarized the orders he had issued to the five major families before. "The reason I've gathered them together is precisely to facilitate supervision. Knowing that Timothy is attacking the Western Territory, it's uncertain if some might get any ideas. The Second Army is equipped with outdated weapons and lacks combat experience. In the event of an emergency, their reaction might be insufficient. But with the addition of ten squads from the First Army, we can ensure they won't be able to cause any trouble. I don't want any chaos behind us while we are fighting at the Redwater River fork."



"Understood, Your Highness," he replied.



"You're going too?" After Iron Axe had left, Nightingale appeared from behind the main seat.



"Of course," Roland spread his hands, "Who else could make good use of Anna's abilities if not me? I may not be the best at commanding troops, but when it comes to blocking roads with bunkers and slapping faces with tanks, that's my speciality."



"I understand what a bunker is, but what's a tank?" Nightingale asked, puzzled.



"Uh... it's like a cart that drags cannons," the prince coughed twice, "but we don't have enough horses, so the cannons need to be transported by the 'Littletown,' which means it can't be called a tank."



"So that's why you chose Honey?" She blinked, "As far as I know, she can tame tigers and leopards to be as docile as horses. But can a cannon pulled by beasts also be called a tank?"



"Of course," Roland couldn't help but curl his lips into a smile, "It could also be directly called a Tiger or Leopard model."



As they were speaking, Carter walked in, cradling a white-tailed kite, "Your Highness, there's a message from Border Town."



Roland clapped his hands, and the white-tailed kite spread its wings as if it had its own intelligence, breaking free from the knight's embrace to soar into the air. After gliding a distance, it landed steadily on his shoulder. He took out a piece of jerky from his pocket and let the bird swallow it, which conscientiously lifted a claw, allowing him to easily untie the cloth strip attached to it.



This kite was not one transformed by Maggie but one of the aerial messengers trained by Honey. They could remember five to six different people and hundreds of flying routes. As long as they were taken to a strange place, they could establish contact with their home nest. This time, on Roland's trip to the stronghold, he brought a total of four messengers, which could travel back and forth between the two places within an hour and fly non-stop for an entire day. Without wireless communication, this was considered the fastest way to stay in touch.



Roland unfolded the letter wrapped in the cloth strip and quickly skimmed through it.



The sender was Wendy, and according to her own request, she had taken Lily, Sylvie, Leaf, Hummingbird, and Nana to the fork of the Redwater River. Also setting out with the ship was a part of the artillery team and eight cannons—this was also the maximum number of cannons that the 'Littletown' deck could accommodate after being lightened.



The prince estimated in his mind that it would take a day for the cement boat to reach its destination when Wendy propelled the sails at full speed. Although Sylvie served as a navigator, allowing the ship to travel at night, Wendy's magic was far less abundant than Anna's, unable to continuously exert her abilities. Therefore, if they rested at night and transported during the day, four days would only be enough for two round trips at most, bringing up to sixteen field guns to the river fork.



Despite the number being less than the last battle, considering the surprise attack and the enemy's inability to quickly counterattack on the boat, the artillery firepower was barely sufficient. Roland took the pen and paper handed over by Nightingale and wrote down new orders—commanding the stationed troops to immediately set out with their weapons and ammunition and meet up with Iron Axe's main force at the river fork.



It would only take half an hour for the white-tailed kite to deliver the letter to Scroll, who would then pass it on to Captain Brian.



...



When Roland arrived at the predetermined location, it was already the next morning.



The glittering waters of the river split here, one flowing towards Longsong Stronghold, and the other connecting to Redwater City.



Since the latter river was wider, people were accustomed to considering it as the main channel of the Redwater River, while the one leading to the stronghold was called the Lesser Redwater.



After disembarking, the witches who had been waiting by the river for a long time came forward to greet him.



"Where's Wendy?" Roland looked around and asked.



"The moment day broke, she returned on the 'Littletown'," Leaf said, "She mentioned that there was another batch of cannons to be transported."

"Did I hear right that you're planning to deal with Timothy Wimbledon, the false king who hunts witches in the city every day?" Lily asked eagerly, "What do you intend for us to do?"

Although Iron Axe and the main force of the First Army had not yet arrived, preliminary preparations could begin in advance—as long as there were witches.

"I need to establish a defense line on both sides of the main channel," he crouched down and used pebbles to sketch a simple diagram, "If this line represents the enemy's route of advance, then my troops would be distributed along both banks, launching a surprise attack in a pincer movement. To achieve the element of surprise, they first have to be hidden. Therefore, you need to build two earth huts on the river banks that form a V-shaped angle, with the huts being elongated, the walls must be thick, divided into eight compartments, and only a small window on the side facing the Redwater River."

"Your Highness, I don't quite understand..." Lily voiced her confusion, "Hiding the soldiers in the earth huts may conceal their movements, but they won't be able to attack the ships on the river. What if the false king's fleet doesn't stop and doesn't approach the shore, and just sails past?"

"No, they won't be able to get past," Roland smiled, "You will see when the time comes."

He then looked towards Leaf, "You're in charge of concealing these fortifications, using weeds and vines will do, just make them look more natural."

"Yes," Leaf replied.

In this way, when the cannons were pushed into the camouflaged fortifications, the two earth huts that seemed useless in Lily's eyes would instantly transform into the "Sail Battleships" that never sink. At that moment, by simply lifting the cover on the windows, each compartment could spit out deadly flames. The sixteen field artillery pieces would not lose accuracy due to jolting. In fact, at such a close range, they could almost hit the sailing ships in the middle of the river blindfolded—not to mention sink them, but at least turn their decks into a bloody battlefield.



Moreover, from the beginning, the enemy was in the disadvantageous position of being at the receiving end of a T-shaped attack. Roland thought smugly, You tell me, how could the God's Punishment Witches possibly lose?
