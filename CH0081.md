## Cannon Operation Training
The daily training would last for two to three hours, and afterward, he would have to return to the city wall to continue his old trade. A fellow from the same dormitory had signed up for the Gun Battalion and now stood behind Tanner, flaunting his brand-new musket nonstop. If it weren't for the disciplinary requirement to refrain from fighting, Tanner would have loved to sew his mouth shut.



But he also noticed something amiss.



How many days had the townsfolk who joined the Gun Battalion been training? They were already honing their shooting skills in combat with demonic beasts, whereas the Artillery Battalion? They hadn't even fired a single cannonball. Moreover, those heavy cannons could not possibly be transported to the top of the city wall.



Just look at the top of the wall—two people standing side by side would almost block the passage. Usually, everyone was used to running on the inner slope of the wall. Even if it was a bit steep, it was better than hindering teammates from performing their bayonet maneuvers. As for the cannons... just the two wheels were wider than the wall top, not to mention they had to shoot downward. It didn't seem practical at all.



Could it be... these things weren't intended to fight against demonic beasts?



The following practice confirmed Tanner's suspicion.



Four artillery teams were taken to the riverbank by Iron Axe. Tanner discovered that, unbeknownst to him, a massive "ship" had appeared in the Redwater River! No... he wasn't sure if it was a ship at all, its hull looked just like the stones used to build the city wall, broad and short. Apart from two bare masts, where did it resemble a ship? This prompted Tanner's group to start arguing.



"This is clearly a pontoon bridge," Jop was the first to conclude. He had followed the ore transport sailboats to Longsong Stronghold and often boasted of his extensive experience, "A deck several zhang wide is obviously for stability! I've been around and seen a lot. If it's a ship, how would it move without wind? There was a flood in this river before that destroyed the wooden bridge in the stronghold that stood for over a decade. The people in the city replaced it with a pontoon bridge, nailing together a bunch of wide planks on flatboats, then pulling up iron chains to form a row—walk on it however you like, it's stable!"



"The farthest you've been is Longsong Stronghold, and you talk about roaming the south and smashing through the north," Rodney sneered, "If it's a pontoon bridge, why would you need two masts? Are you afraid it won't get blown away by the wind?"



Furthermore, if you look at the tail end, isn't that a helm wheel laid across? A pontoon bridge certainly wouldn't need that." Nelson chimed in, he and his brother always saw eye to eye, "Also, the arrangement of the wooden frames in the middle looks like they're going to set up a shed, it's just not finished yet. It's a ship, without a doubt."



Tanner wasn't particularly interested in whether it was a ship or not; he was more concerned about the training content that would follow. The answer was soon revealed—Iron Axe asked them to drive the horses dragging the artillery carriage onto the "Littletown"—yes, that was the name of the ship, and it was personally named by His Highness the Prince. After listening to Iron Axe's introduction, Jop's face became stiff, while the two brothers were smug—then they tied the wheels of the cannon to the reserved stop bars.



There were two sets of these stop bars, each with four, located along the centerline of the deck, arranged one set in front of the other. It was clear that they could load two cannons at once.



Well, Tanner thought, now it was certain that they weren't dealing with demonic beasts anymore—the Redwater River flowed from north to south, and there was no river in the Misty Forest wide enough for such a ship.



The first time he stepped onto the deck, Tanner immediately felt its outstanding stability. The river water flowed alongside the hull, while the stone ship remained motionless, as if standing on solid ground. Only when the horses were driven up did one feel a slight sway.



He also noticed that every time a group of artillerymen completed a round of boarding and disembarking practice, Iron Axe would record the time on the side. Considering the stop bars on the deck, it seemed that only two of the four groups could be put to use. Tanner secretly shared this information with his group members, and everyone immediately exerted their full effort in each step. It would be a minor issue of losing face if they were not selected and sent back to the Spear Squad, but losing the increased pay was a major concern!



By the seventh day, Tanner finally welcomed the long-awaited live-fire shooting training.



And on this day, His Highness the Prince also came to the scene to watch the artillerymen's practice. Each member of the four groups puffed out their chests and walked with vigor and energy.



Since everyone had already become quite familiar with the routine of loading ammunition, it didn't take long before Tanner's group fired the first cannon.



This was also his first time witnessing the power of a cannon. Amid the deafening roar, an iron ball twice the size of a fist landed in the snow a mile away, kicking up a large swathe of snow and mud, then bouncing forward a great distance. His naked eye couldn't catch the trajectory of the iron ball at all.



This made Tanner excited, but also secretly fearful. How exactly did Prince Roland create such a terrifying weapon? If he were to face a cannon attack, even with full body armor, it would probably be of no use.



After each group fired a round, Prince Roland would have someone plant a flag at the first point where the cannonball landed, and at the same time, a hemp rope was cut from the flag to the muzzle of the cannon. After four rounds, when it was Tanner's group's turn again, he heard instructions to change the firing angle of the muzzle.



At both ends of the cannon barrel, where it connected to the gun carriage, there was a dial engraved with scales marked with 0, 5, 10, 25, and 30. Although he didn't quite understand what it meant, he just followed the instructions. Iron Axe shouted, "Elevation five!" Jop, with the greatest strength, immediately placed the ramrod under the gun chamber and pried up the cannon from the rear end. Tanner twisted the screw on the gun carriage until the first white line disappeared into the hole, and only then did Jop release the ramrod.



After the rear end of the barrel fell back down, it was slightly lower than the original position, the muzzle was raised, and the scale indicator was precisely on the number 5.



Then it was four more rounds of shooting, planting flagpoles, cutting ropes, and adjusting elevations.



Gradually, Tanner began to understand what Prince Roland was doing.

He was collecting the distance of each cannonball shot, and the higher the elevation angle of the muzzle, the further the distance the cannonball would land.



Tanner had a deep understanding of this when using a bow; shooting upwards allowed the arrow to go further, while shooting straight ahead, the arrow would quickly hit the ground. He didn't expect cannons to be the same, only that because of their speed, they flew much further. He couldn't help but wonder, if the speed of the iron ball reached a certain level, would it never land?



...

By the banks of the Redwater River, the trial voyage of the "Littletown" was also underway in full swing.



Considering the use of Wendy as the power source, the crew on board had to be absolutely reliable. Thus, Roland selected a group of politically steadfast subordinates to serve as the inaugural crew for the "Littletown." The captain and commander was the Chief Knight Carter, the helmsman was Iron Axe, and the raising and lowering of the sails were the responsibility of Carter's attendants, while the signalman was Titus Pine. These people were often in contact with witches and, coupled with Roland's own subtle ideological transformation, held no prejudice against witches anymore. Titus went even further, extending the love he had for his own daughter to the entire witch community.
