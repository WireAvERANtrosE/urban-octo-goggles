## Northern Region Coachman
Winter is a time without harvest for most people in the North, especially for towns near the Hermes Plateau. The Evil Months bring not only endless rain and snow but also bitter cold, hunger, and death. However, "Peg Leg" White is different. Every winter, an envoy from the Church would seek him out to drive several trips to the border of the Kingdom of Wolfheart, picking up the suffering orphans and taking them to the Old Holy City.



It's a good deal, earning almost twenty Silver Royals per trip, and it's also a great charitable act. This year's Evil Months are almost at an end, and this trip should be the last one.



"My lord, why don't you stay inside the carriage? The snow is going to continue for a while. You're not used to braving the elements like we are every day; please don't catch a cold."



"This is nothing," the envoy said, taking a swig from his flask. "The New Holy City is much colder than here. On the plateau, neither leather clothes nor armor can fend off the biting cold. It's like a demon that penetrates every part of your body. Without the warmth pills, it's really not a place for ordinary people."



"You're right," White nodded again and again. He had never been to the New Holy City and had no desire to visit. What was there to see in a place of solid ice and demonic beasts? However, as an experienced coachman, he could always find new topics for conversation, and this envoy was much more talkative than the previous one. "Your gloves, they're made from the special wolf skin from the western region of Greycastle, right?"



"Oh? You know about that?"



"Heh, my lord, I've been in this business for nearly thirty years," White said proudly, "First driving for a baron, then for a countess, and even drove for the little Princess of Wolfheart. If it weren't for an accident that broke my leg, I might still be at the count's estate. They may lack for nothing, but Gold Royals are plenty: Greycastle furs and silverware, Everwinter jewels, Fjord's handicrafts... they talk about them non-stop as soon as they get on the carriage, my ears almost form calluses."



"I see," the envoy nodded. "So that's the origin of your nickname? What kind of accident was it?"



"Ah, it was a refugee riot. Those scoundrels would do anything for a bit of food." White spat, "At that time, they surrounded the carriage, and to protect the countess, I had to drive the horses into a frenzy. Unfortunately, the horses got spooked, throwing me off, and the carriage overturned."



"So you broke your leg?" the ambassador asked curiously. "What about the Countess?"

"She fared better, the carriage had soft cushions and thick quilts, only ended up with a bruised and swollen face," White complained indignantly. "She crawled out and ran off, leaving me on the road. I dragged my broken leg home, spent all my savings to get myself a prosthetic leg," he tapped on the copper rod sticking out of his trousers, "but the Earl's estate kicked me out on the pretext that I could no longer drive, those damned nobles!"

"How regrettable," the ambassador paused. "But the divine has not forsaken you, you are now driving for the Church. The Heavens are merciful."

"Yes, my lord. The Heavens are merciful." No, if the Heavens were truly merciful, they wouldn't have let me encounter such an ordeal, White thought. When I needed it most, it didn't save me.

At that moment, the sound of a girl's crying came from the carriage.

"Stop for a moment."

White tightened the reins, gradually bringing the two horses to a halt, as the ambassador stepped down from the carriage and walked around to the back. Soon, the sound of a whip cracking could be heard from inside.

Poor child, he sighed, just endure it, this is your savior. Without the envoy, you wouldn't even survive this winter, and would end up as unattended corpses on the streets.

After a while, the ambassador returned and climbed onto the coachman's seat, "Let's go."



"Please hold on tight. Giddy up!" White shook the reins, and the carriage started moving again. "Are they all from various parts of the Wolfheart Kingdom?"



"Pretty much. The churches in each town of the kingdom take in some orphans, especially when food and clothing are scarce in winter, we take in several times more people. The clergy alone can't care for them all, so we also entrust some reputable coachmen from the carting business to help us transport them. You've performed quite well, White, my predecessor had high praise for you."



"It is my honor to be involved in such charitable work," White said with a grin. "Sir, will they all be sent to the convent? Forgive my bluntness, although they are all orphans, their characters are not the same. Some may be young, but have done all sorts of things; won't such people defile the sacred place?"



"The gods will judge, and even the guilty can have a chance at redemption."



"Is that so? That's really good news." White raised his head, glancing at the sky. "It's getting late, sir. Should we spend the night in the next town? If the weather is good tomorrow, we should be able to reach the Old Holy City by noon."



The emissary sighed, "Find an inn, one with a yard that can accommodate the carriage. Go prepare some food for them."



"Right away!" White responded.



This town was a necessary route from the Wolfheart Kingdom to the Old Holy City, and it wasn't his first time here; he quickly found an inn he used to stay at. After driving the carriage into the yard, he took the coins handed to him by the emissary and went to buy food for the orphans. As usual, sweet potato porridge was the best choice—cheap and not bad in taste. Watching them finish their porridge, White limped back to the inn, ordered some buttered bread, and began to eat it sitting at the bar. As for the emissary, he would surely have a better place to go.



If it had been ten years earlier, before his leg was broken, he would have gone to a tavern for a glass of wine and found some people to throw a few dice with—back then, he was always lucky. Now... White touched the coin purse in his bosom; it was better to go back to his room and rest early.



In the evening, he heard some noise in the courtyard. Getting up and lifting the curtain, White saw the drunken messenger unlocking the carriage door and climbing inside. In a short while, he dragged out two orphans. Behind him stood two others, dressed and looking like nobles.



White let the curtain fall and returned to the warmth of his bed.



This wasn't the first time he had witnessed such a thing; the previous envoy often did the same. To be alive was the greatest fortune, he thought; better to endure a moment of pain than to suffer continually. Once you reach the Holy City, you'll be able to start a new life. At least in the monastery, there's no worry of hunger or cold. White yawned and fell into a deep sleep.



As soon as it was light, he was on his way with the envoy. The journey was smooth, and they arrived at the Old Holy City half an hour earlier than expected. There the church's carriages were already waiting for them, it seemed the unfortunate souls still had some way to go, but that was no longer his concern.



"Here is your payment," the envoy tossed him a cloth bag.



White caught it and counted twice in his palm – indeed, twenty Silver royals, not bad. He nodded and bowed, "I hope to see you again next year."



The envoy did not respond, merely waving his hand to signal him to leave.



White noticed that besides him, there were several other carriages doing the same work. Perhaps they were from other kingdoms? He wondered. But one thing seemed very strange: all the children who came down from the carriages appeared to be little girls. When the church adopts orphans, do they only adopt girls?



He shook his head, casting these questions from his mind, and set off on the return journey.
