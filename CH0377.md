## Under the Low Temperature
The boiler heating system is not a complex gadget; essentially, it heats up boiling water and then transports the heat energy through pipes to the rooms, where it is dispersed by radiators. The carrier of the heat can be water or steam, and Roland chose the latter because steam has a higher temperature limit and is more convenient for circulation. As long as the boiler keeps burning, the generated steam pressure will automatically fill every corner of the pipes with tiny high-temperature droplets, eliminating the need for a water pump.



Of course, steam heating also has its drawbacks. The pipes are always under high pressure, and if the joints are not firm, they can easily leak or even explode. Contact with steam at temperatures of two to three hundred degrees can cause severe burns, so the installation quality demands are higher. Anna's black line welding can ensure the strength of the joints, and with Sorya's coating, this drawback can undoubtedly be minimized.



Roland also installed an automatic pressure relief valve on the boiler. Its mechanical principle is the same as the centrifugal governor on a steam engine, where a high-speed flywheel would lift the valve to vent and reduce pressure when the pressure inside the furnace is too high.



The last safety feature is located where the boiler connects to the two main heating pipes. He had Anna carve several grooves around the copper pipes to weaken their strength, similar to a soda can. Even if the pressure valve fails to open properly, an explosion would occur inside the boiler room and not endanger the people in the rooms.



Once the heating system was up and running, the castle's scenery completely changed.



The heavy winter clothes disappeared, and the witches put on their autumn dresses once again. Watching the colorful girls chattering and laughing before him, Roland felt his motivation for work increase by an invisible five percent.



Of course, these facilities were built for enjoyment, or rather, to create a better working environment.



What comes next is an important project related to the future of the Western Region.



That is to realize the artificial synthesis of ammonia, reducing the dependence on saltpeter, thereby increasing the production of chemical explosives to a new height, and meeting the requirements needed by automatic firearms.



If we can achieve this goal before the end of winter, it will undoubtedly place a significant chip on our planned spring offensive.

Roland called Camilla Dary and Agatha to his office.

"How has your cooperation been these days?" he asked with a smile. One was the chief alchemist of Border Town, who, apart from his immense passion for alchemy, hardly cared about others' feelings and opinions. The other was a witch from the Witch Kingdom four hundred years ago, proud of being a member of the highest research institution, the Quest Society. Both were straightforward people, putting them together was like a powder keg ready to explode. Roland often worried if they would get into arguments, but whether it was nitroglycerine or synthetic ammonia, both required their collaboration, so he had to ask about the situation first. If there were any disagreements, he would have to mediate.

"Very well," Camilla's first words took Roland by surprise, "Miss Agatha's abilities are of great help to chemical experiments. I have already found the stable synthesis temperature for nitroglycerin. There are no issues with laboratory production, and we are further testing the possibility of industrial production... It can be said that without the Ice Calyx, none of this would have been possible. Oh, I didn't notify you because I was too busy with work." He paused, "By the way, if you were asking about this, can I return to the laboratory now? I still have a lot to do."

Uh... is that so? Roland looked at Agatha, who nodded.

"Mr. Camilla's knowledge is indeed extraordinary, especially his understanding of elements, which is quite similar to the Quest Society. Our collaboration has been very pleasant so far. If he were in Taquila, the Union would surely absorb him."

Could it be that people with straightforward personalities get along better with each other? It seems I worried over nothing. And why does the chief alchemist have a better attitude towards the witch than towards me? It's rather disheartening... After grumbling inwardly, Roland cleared his throat, "In that case, I'm relieved. I called you here because there is a new research task I want to entrust to you."

Hearing the word 'research,' Camilla immediately perked up, "Please go on."

"I've mentioned before that there are many different gases in the air, and now is the time to utilize them." Roland outlined his idea briefly, "According to 'Elementary Chemistry,' oxygen and nitrogen make up 99% of the air's composition. Now, I need to separate these two gases for use in chemical production."



Kamose pondered for a moment before replying, "You mean to use their different properties... such as different boiling and melting points to separate them?"



"Exactly," Roland nodded approvingly, "By cooling the air and then reheating it, the boiling point of nitrogen is lower than that of oxygen, so it will be the first to be distilled from the liquid. Since this temperature is far below the freezing point, it is difficult to achieve with conventional means at present, so we must rely on Agatha's ability to realize it."



"Turning air into a liquid," Kamose stroked his beard and grinned, "sounds very interesting."



"If we further lower the temperature, they can even become solid, just like ice," Roland said with a smile. This is definitely a scene that contemporary alchemists could never have imagined; seemingly ethereal gases can be held in handâ€”the precondition being proper anti-freezing measures.



Agatha expressed her confusion, "I have read some of that book, but when I froze the air, I didn't see it solidify into various gases."



"That's because they do not stratify when mixed together, making it difficult to discern with the naked eye," Roland explained, "Carbon dioxide is the first to be excluded as it has a relatively high freezing point, but its content in the air is so low that you might not even notice the tiny particles it forms when frozen. Next are oxygen and nitrogen, which can blend perfectly, presenting a pale blue color. If not separated, they look like a single pure substance. In fact, liquid nitrogen should be colorless."



"What should we do?" 



"First, prepare a distillation vessel," the prince said with an upturned corner of his mouth, "This is going to be a big project."



Without a doubt, relying solely on Agatha wouldn't be enough. Glass is prone to breakage with repeated temperature changes, so the container for the liquid air could only be made with a full steel shell. This wouldn't be a problem for Anna, but a fully sealed shell would prevent the observation of the changes in the liquid air during heating, so they would also need Sylvie's Magic Eyes to see through the container and observe the scene inside. Then, they would have Agatha record the specific amount of magic power consumed when the liquid nitrogen boils, to obtain the temperature parameters for stable production.



This preparatory work lasted for three days.

When the container was completed, Roland personally visited the chemical laboratory to supervise the town's first attempt at oxygen and nitrogen separation.
