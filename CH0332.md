## Sightseeing
Before setting out to explore the ruins, Tilly's greatest interest was to stroll slowly along the flat streets of Border Town, observing the astonishing changes that had taken place in this remote territory under the rule of Lord Roland.

It was a town like no other, she thought, the more she observed, the stronger this feeling became. It was completely different from any place she had visited... What impressed her most was the unparalleled vitality emanating from the town.

Even the emerging Sleeping Island could not compare.

"Aren't these people afraid of freezing?" Andrea asked curiously, watching the pedestrians bustling up and down the streets. "What kind of benefits did your brother offer to make them willing to busily work in the dead of winter?"

"It's still mid-autumn," Ashes spread her hands, "you can't even tell the seasons apart now, can you?"

"But it's no different from winter, it's a figure of speech, frequently used in 'Her Dream, His Country'," Andrea gracefully flicked her long hair, "Of course, a barbarian wouldn't understand."

"What's this 'your dream my dream'..."

"See, it's difficult to communicate with someone who has never appreciated the fine arts of theater. Lady Tilly must have watched this famous play from the Kingdom of Dawn."

"Stop arguing, both of you," Sylvie sighed, "I think the reason is quite simple. Commoners are reluctant to move about in winter because it consumes a lot of energy, there's not enough food, and it's easy to catch a cold, but none of these problems exist in the town. Here, the price of grain is low, firewood is plentiful, and Miss Lily can cure colds, so they work hard against the cold wind and snowflakes—working one more day means earning one more day's wages."



"I can understand having plenty of firewood since we're next to the Misty Forest, and there are many woods around, but how is it possible that the price of grains is not high...?" Andrea asked in confusion, "My family has also been involved in the grain trade, and when disasters cause poor harvests, everyone would raise the price of grain very high. With such bad weather, how could the nobles and merchants not sell at high prices?"



"Nobles? Merchants?" Sylvie couldn't help but laugh, "Here, there is only one person allowed to trade grain, and that is Prince Roland."



"All the farmlands by the river are his property?" Tilly frowned.



"No, those are the fields of the serfs themselves," she explained what she had seen and heard here, as well as the scenes during the harvest, "He has set two prices for grain, one is the purchase price, and the other is the selling price, both of which are fixed, with the latter being higher than the former."



"Isn't that just forced buying and selling?" Ashes said with an expected look, "He can sell at a high price, so why can't others?"



"It's not the same," Tilly pondered, "After the wheat is harvested, it needs to be threshed, ground, and stored, all of which are costs, and it's quite normal for the prices to rise."



"Miss Tilly is right, I only understood after asking the scholar teacher," Sylvie said with a smile, "She said that the additional costs can be used to pay the workers who process the wheat, to build new granaries, to expand the scale of production, all of which can provide new..." she thought for a moment, "job opportunities for the town, that's right, that's what she said. I heard that Prince Roland cares a lot about this."



"But he is still forcing buying and selling," Ashes stressed, "Shouldn't trade be free?"



"Perhaps it should be, but the selling price set by His Highness isn't so high that no one can afford it. If this price can remain fixed, the people will feel more at ease."



"Sometimes, freedom isn't always the best thing," Tilly remarked, having roughly understood the intent behind Roland's actions. Prohibiting anyone else in the territory from selling grain might seem domineering and unfair, but it actually eliminated hoarding and could effectively prevent prices from skyrocketing during shortages. If this were in the capital, such rare autumn snowfall would surely cause grain prices to surge to more than five or six times the usual rate. More than half of the commoners would go hungry due to insufficient grain reserves, and if this persisted, it could easily lead to riots, forcing the royal palace to distribute relief grain or dispatch guards to suppress the unrest. Either scenario would place a significant burden on the treasury.



Although this policy seemed good, it wouldn't work just anywhere. Those who controlled grain trade were mostly nobles and wealthy merchants, who owned a large number of serfs and lands; the royal family couldn't possibly force them to sell their grain and forbid them from stockpiling it. However, in Border Town, aside from Roland Wimbledon himself, there were virtually no noble families—it was entirely up to him.



After Tilly shared her views, Ashes still felt somewhat disgruntled, "What about the serfs? When grain prices rise, they might earn more, but now their earnings are fixed at a set price and exploited away."



"Pfft," Andrea scoffed, "You talk as if in cities with free trade, these people could avoid exploitation. When there's a bumper crop of wheat, not only do they have to hand over more, but the price of what they keep gets pushed so low. And during poor harvests, what's left after the obligatory contributions might not even be enough to survive the famine. By comparison, fixed prices are more reasonable; the more they produce, the more they earn."



"Here, they have a choice not to," Sylvie's words caused the three to pause slightly, "His Highness mentioned that once the output reaches a certain standard, serfs can be promoted to free people. Whether they continue to work in the fields or choose a new job is up to their own will. However, free people only need to hand over twenty percent of the grain, and considering this year's bumper harvest, the purchase price, the salary is quite considerable."



"Promotion?"



"Mhm, His Highness also said that he wants to see Border Town without a single serf in two or three years."



So that's it, Tilly suddenly felt something stir inside her—this was why the town was so vibrant... When he formulated policies, he actually considered the people's thoughts and included incentive systems to encourage them to do more and better—this was completely different from any noble lord's methods. The incentives weren't just verbal, but an actual concession of benefits, allowing people to earn through hard work, rather than hoarding those benefits deep in the castle's underground vaults.



Only now did she truly understand the meaning behind those red banners by the riverbank.



However, Roland Wimbledon was not a generous man while in the palace... So, was this also a change brought about by that part of "sudden memories"? And the content of elementary nature and mathematics classes at night, all fascinated her.



Tilly originally thought that after reading through the court's collection of books, it would be hard to find anything else that could pique her curiosity and interest, but now, she discovered there was still so much she needed to learn.



A feeling suddenly surged in her heart that even if she did nothing but stay in the small town's castle, flipping through those books filled with magical knowledge, while watching the changes of the town, would also be a delightful thing.



Suddenly, a long bell toll came from the direction of the city walls, signaling an alarm for the attack of demonic beasts.



Tilly pushed these thoughts to the bottom of her heart. Unfortunately, she was no longer the unfettered fifth princess, but the leader burdened with the fate of the witches of Sleeping Island. There were some things she couldn't do simply based on her own preferences, "Let's go to the city walls and have a look, maybe we can help the guards."



"Of course," Andrea said with a slight smile, "That's why we're here. Let them see for themselves how witches fight."
