## "Release"
The square, which had gathered just over two thousand people, was no less imposing than a large gathering of tens of thousands of people in later generations. Roland reflected to himself that the ability of echo was really quite useful.



The purpose of selecting these few people was mainly to set an example for the public—none of the three were nobles. Iron Axe was from the Sand People of the Southern Territory; Kyle, though the Chief Alchemist, was not of a distinguished birth and had climbed up from being an apprentice step by step; and Nana was a witch.



There were people from other races, commoners, and witches—by the terms of later generations, it was simply impeccable political correctness.



Roland hoped to use such a ceremony to instill his philosophy into all his subjects—that in Border Town, merit was all that mattered, not one's background.



The first to step forward for the knighthood was Iron Axe. Roland personally handed him the gold medal engraved with the emblem of the high tower of Greycastle, surrounded by gears and wheat sheaves. The soldiers of the First Army below all raised their hands and applauded, many blowing whistles.



"You should all know his name, the commander of the First Army's gun squad, Iron Axe!" Roland turned to face everyone, "Before the Evil Months arrived, he was just an ordinary hunter in the town. In all the battles that have broken out in Border Town to date, Iron Axe has not missed a single one. Just last month, he led the soldiers of the First Army all the way to the capital, rescuing the refugees of the Eastern Region trapped by the demonic plague! The more than six thousand subjects currently residing outside the city walls were brought back by him!"



The majority of the crowd in the square were locals and soldiers of the First Army, with serfs and refugees only constituting a few hundred. However, with the mobilization of the echo, there was no lack of atmosphere at all. As Roland paused in his speech, the recognition and calls of the refugees immediately rose to the occasion, and their intensity was hardly any less than the applause of the First Army.



Iron Axe also appeared very excited, probably having never imagined that he, as a person of the Mojin race, could also receive the favor of the prince. He first performed the military salute that Roland had established, then knelt on one knee, offering the salute of a knight of the kingdom. If Roland hadn't supported him, he might have even proceeded to perform the full prostration salute of the Sand People.



"Rise, as a soldier, a military salute will suffice," Roland said with a smile.



"Thank you... Your Highness." His voice trembled slightly as if he was trying hard to suppress his emotions.

The prince comfortingly patted Iron Axe on the shoulder, handed him a hundred Gold Royals, and then asked Kyle Sichi to step forward.

"This man, whom you may be seeing for the first time, comes from the central part of the kingdom, the chief alchemist of the Redwater City Alchemy Workshop, Mr. Kyle Sichi!"

Upon hearing this, the subjects all gasped in astonishment.

"The chief alchemist? Isn't that a wise man who would be respected and treated courteously even before the king?"

"Like the royal astrologer?"

"No, an alchemist holds even higher status than an astrologer. After all, nobody can be sure if the astrologer's predictions will come true, but what an alchemist creates is tangible and real."

"And he's from the Redwater City Alchemy Workshop, no less. I heard that only the Alchemy Association in the royal capital can compare!"

"..."



In the Four Kingdoms, alchemists and astrologers hold a transcendent status. To commoners, alchemists, known as sages, are more worthy of preaching than the great nobles and lords. Roland was very satisfied with everyone's reaction. He gestured for them to quiet down with a hand, and then continued, "Although Mr. Steuer has not personally participated in the battles, the several improvements to the firearms, from single-shot to repeating rifles, are all closely related to his chemical laboratory. This is also an important guarantee for the First Army's victory. Without these alchemical—chemical products, Border Town could not truly achieve peace and tranquility." The prince paused for a moment, "By the way, the chemical laboratory is currently recruiting apprentice alchemists. Citizens who have completed the town's elementary education and passed the assessment can be recruited. Successful applicants will not only receive generous compensation but also have the chance to become an outstanding alchemist master like Mr. Steuer!"



The crowd once again burst into an uproar, while Kyle himself looked impatient. Taking the medal, he said in annoyance, "You called me here just for this? What a waste of time. I'd rather be doing more experiments."



"This is a great opportunity for publicity. Haven't you always complained about being short-staffed?" Roland shrugged, "Once the laboratory's size has doubled, I plan to write 'Intermediate Chemistry' and hand it over to you to teach."



"Intermediate... Chemistry?" Kyle immediately bowed and said, "Thank you, Your Highness!"



While focus is important, cultivating successors is equally urgent. The larger the base of the masses, the easier it is to achieve results, and the same goes for scientific research. Roland did not intend to put all his eggs in one basket. With such a perfect advertising opportunity, he would certainly not let it slip by.



The last person was Nana.



Looking at the little girl who walked up to him, visibly nervous, Roland couldn't help feeling deeply moved.



Compared to the hiding during the Evil Months, now, he was finally ready to push the witches to the forefront—after nearly half a year of groundwork, the town had now reached the best situation. Choosing Nana as a representative was a decision he made after careful consideration: in the First Army, she was called an angel by the soldiers, her reputation higher than Iron Axe's, second only to his own. Many residents of the town had also been treated by her, whether for mining accidents or mechanical injuries, everyone had developed the habit of seeking the "Little Angel" for healing when injured.



After repeatedly watching the play "The Witch's Story," the serfs' attitude towards witches was no longer as resistant as before. The image of the woman in the play, with her twisting fate but brave struggle, won the sympathy and favor of many.



The refugees likewise survived because of Lily's ability. Even if some of them despised witches in their hearts, they wouldn't speak ill of them after being rescued. Moreover, they were not weak individuals who were being hunted down and forced to hide by the Church—at least in Border Town, these women with extraordinary abilities were under the protection of Lord Roland.



And the most critical point was: even if there were believers of the Church who wanted to denounce them, it would be difficult to stir up any trouble in the Western Region. The town was completely under his control, and the church in the Longsong Stronghold had been razed to the ground by Timothy, causing the Church to lose its stronghold for monitoring the Western Region. Unless they went to the more distant Dragon Cliffs City or Redwater City, they couldn't find even one priest to report to.



"This is—" Before Roland had a chance to introduce her, a thunderous cheer burst forth from the square.



"Miss Nana! Miss Nana is here!"



"Angel Miss, thank you for healing my husband!"



"Little girl, you must come to my house for a meal when you have time. I've raised two chickens specifically, whether you want steamed egg custard or chicken soup, it's all possible!"



"Nana looked at me!"



"No, she's looking at me!"



Nana couldn't help but cover her mouth, her eyes becoming moist. Roland believed that the other witches were feeling the same at this moment—they had finally shed the evil identity imposed on them by the Church, and from now on, they could walk under the sunlight like ordinary people. Roland smiled and patted her head, "Don't be afraid, just respond to everyone's enthusiasm simply. Don't forget, you're now the representative of the Witch Union."



"Mm..." She sniffed, wiped away the tears that were about to spill from her eyes, and bent over to curtsy. "Thank you... Thank you all!"
