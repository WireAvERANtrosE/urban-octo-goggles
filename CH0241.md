## Release
Despite the square only gathering a little more than two thousand people, the momentum was hardly less than that of a large assembly of tens of thousands in the modern era, Roland thought to himself, appreciating the usefulness of echoes.



The purpose of selecting these individuals was primarily to set an example for the populace—among the three of them, not one was a noble. Iron Axe was from the Southern Sand People; Carter Lannis, although the Chief Alchemist, did not come from a distinguished background and had climbed up from being an apprentice; and Nana was a witch.



With a foreigner, a commoner, and a witch, in terms of modern-day parlance, it was the epitome of political correctness.



Roland hoped that through such a ceremony, he could instill his philosophy into all the subjects—that in Border Town, only merit matters, not one's background.



The first to step forward for the award was Iron Axe, to whom Roland personally delivered a gold medal embossed with the emblem of Greycastle's high tower, gears, and an encircling wheat sheaf. The soldiers of the First Army below all raised their hands in applause, with many whistling.



"You all should know his name, the commander of the First Army's Gun Battalion, Iron Axe!" Roland turned to face everyone. "Before the Evil Months arrived, he was just an ordinary hunter in the town. Iron Axe has not missed a single battle that has broken out in Border Town to date, and just last month, he led the First Army soldiers all the way to the capital, rescuing the Eastern Region refugees besieged by the demonic plague! The more than six thousand subjects now temporarily residing outside the city walls were brought back by him!"



The majority of the crowd in the square consisted of natives and First Army soldiers, with serfs and refugees only accounting for a few hundred people. However, with the motivation provided by the echoes, there was no lack of atmosphere. Roland paused, and immediately, there were responses and cheers from the refugees, as dense as the applause from the First Army.



Iron Axe also appeared very excited, probably never having imagined that he, as a person of the Mojin clan, could also gain favor from a prince. He first performed the military salute as established by Roland, then knelt on one knee, offering a knightly gesture of the kingdom. If Roland hadn't supported him, he probably would have gone on to perform the prostration of the Sand People.



"Rise, as a military man, a simple salute will do," Roland said with a smile.



"Thank you... Your Highness." His voice trembled slightly, as if he was trying hard to suppress his emotions.

The prince patted Iron Axe's shoulder reassuringly and handed him a hundred Gold Royals, then asked Camilla Dary to come forward.

"This gentleman, whom you may be seeing for the first time, hails from the central part of the kingdom, the chief alchemist of the Redwater City Alchemy Workshop, Mr. Camilla Dary!"

As soon as these words were spoken, the subjects all drew in a breath of cold air.

"The chief alchemist? Isn't that a wise man who would receive respect and courtesy even in front of the king?"

"Like the royal court astrologer?"

"No, the alchemist's position is even higher than that of an astrologer. After all, no one can be sure if the latter's prophecies will come true, but at least what the alchemist makes is tangible."

"And he's from the Redwater City Alchemy Workshop no less, I heard that only the capital's Alchemists' Association can compare!"

"..."



In the Four Kingdoms, alchemists and astrologers hold an exalted status, and for the common people, alchemists, known as sages, are more worthy of preaching than the great nobles and lords. Roland was very satisfied with everyone's reaction. He gestured downwards with his hand to calm the crowd before continuing, "Although Mr. Scroll did not personally participate in the battles, the several improvements to the firearm, from single-shot to repeating rifles, are inseparable from his chemistry laboratory. This is also an important guarantee for the First Army's victory. Without these alchemical—chemical products, Border Town would not be able to truly win peace and tranquility." The prince paused for a moment, "By the way, the chemistry laboratory is currently recruiting apprentice alchemists. Residents who have completed the town's primary education and passed the assessment can be recruited. Successful candidates will not only receive generous compensation but also have the opportunity to become an outstanding alchemy master like Mr. Scroll!"



The crowd burst into noise once again, while Kyle himself looked impatient. Accepting the medal, he said gruffly, "You called me here just for this? What a waste of time. I would rather be conducting more experiments."



"This is a great opportunity for publicity. Haven't you always complained about the lack of manpower?" Roland shrugged. "Once the laboratory's size doubles, I plan to write 'Intermediate Chemistry' and give it to you to teach."



"Intermediate... Chemistry?" Kyle immediately bowed and said, "Thank you, Your Highness!"



While focus is important, cultivating successors is equally urgent. The larger the base of the crowd, the easier it is to achieve results in projects, and the same goes for scientific research. Roland did not intend to put all his eggs in one basket, and of course, he would not miss such a perfect advertising opportunity.



The last person was Nana.



Watching the little girl, who looked somewhat nervous, walk up to his side, Roland couldn't help but feel deeply moved.



Compared to the hiding and skulking during the Evil Months, now, he finally planned to push the witches in front of the people—after nearly half a year of groundwork, the town had reached its best state. Choosing Nana as the representative was also a decision he made after careful consideration: In the First Army, she was called an angel by the soldiers, her reputation was higher than Iron Axe's, second only to himself. Many townspeople had also received her treatment, whether it was a mining accident or a machine injury, everyone had developed the habit of seeking the little angel for healing when they were hurt.



The serfs, after repeatedly watching the play "The Witch's Story," no longer had the same resistance to witches as before. The image of the woman in the drama, with her twisted fate but brave struggle, won the favor and sympathy of many.



And it was due to Lily's ability that the refugees survived as well. Even if some harbored a dislike for witches, they would not hurl insults after being saved. Moreover, they were not the vulnerable individuals who were being hunted from place to place by the Church—at least in Border Town, these women with extraordinary abilities were under the protection of His Lordship.



And the most crucial point was that even if there were followers of the Church who wanted to denounce them, it would be difficult to stir up any trouble in the Western Region. The town was completely under his control, and the church in Longsong Stronghold had been leveled by Timothy, leaving the Church without a foothold for monitoring the West. Unless they traveled to the more distant Dragon Ridge Mountains and Redwater City, they wouldn't even be able to find an ecclesiastic to take a denunciation.



“This is—” Roland hadn't yet had a chance to introduce her when a thunderous cheer erupted from the square.



“Miss Nana! Miss Nana is here!”



“Angel Miss, thank you for healing my husband!”



“Little girl, you must come to my house for a meal when you have time. I've raised two chickens just for you, whether it's for steamed egg custard or chicken soup!”



“Nana looked at me!”



“No, she was looking at me!”



Nana couldn't help but cover her mouth, her eyes becoming moist. Roland believed that the other witches must be feeling the same at this moment—they had finally shed the Church's imposed identity of evildoers and could now walk under the sun like ordinary people. Roland smiled and patted her head, “Don't be afraid, just respond to everyone's enthusiasm. Don't forget, you are now the representative of the Witch Union.”



"Um..." She sniffled, wiping away the tears that were about to spill over, and bowed in gratitude, "Thank you... thank you all!"
