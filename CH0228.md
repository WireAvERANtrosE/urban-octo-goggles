## Faceless One
The old woman sheathed her dagger, placed The Rat on the ground, wiped the vial on her body, and handed it back to the priest.

"Well done," Felize nodded. "Drag him out and dispose of him."

"Yes." Her voice was hoarse in response, but she dragged the body away with little effort, not at all like someone on the brink of death.

"My lord, do you believe what he said?" After the manager left, Priest Shatas asked, "The caravan and the witches are mingled together, and it's by the assignment of the Border Town lord—if I remember correctly, isn't that lord the Fourth Prince, Roland Wimbledon?"

"Whether it is true or not, we'll only know after we've checked," Felize said seriously. "But I think the possibility of him lying is not high. Just by watching from the walls for a moment, one can notice the movements of the refugees. If he wanted to fabricate a lie to exchange for the Holy Medicine, he would have to come up with something more difficult to verify."

"I will send someone to verify it immediately," the priest said, bowing.

"Go, and report back to me immediately with any news you find."

Felize slowly walked to the table and sat down, playing with the Holy Medicine in his hand. These refugees were already in his pocket. To control their movements and prevent them from escaping on their own, after the spread of the demonic plague, he had instructed the Dream Water to send rats to infiltrate among the refugees, spreading the news that the Church was coming to save them. As long as they could endure a few more days, they would not only receive the redemption of the gods but might also be accepted by the Church and become a part of the capital of Greycastle. As for the infiltrated rats, most were patients infected with the demonic plague, who would definitely spare no effort to work for their own benefit in exchange for the Holy Spirit Potion.

If the rats' information was accurate, these people had been transporting refugees since at least yesterday, and by the looks of it, they seemed determined not to stop until they had moved them all, which amounted to a severe obstruction of his own plans. What's more, they had joined forces with the witches—Felize believed that those who could cure the demonic plague must also be witches.



"My lord, the bodies have been taken care of," the old woman tiptoed into the secret chamber, "Has another fallen one appeared?"



"Nine times out of ten," Ferlin Eltek said in a deep voice, "and there might be more than one." He paused, "There are no outsiders here, there's no need to keep up that hideous appearance, it's disgusting to look at."



"Yes."



She bent over, and then her whole body crackled loudly as if all her bones were rubbing against each other. Her figure grew rapidly, her gray hair turned black in the blink of an eye, and her wrinkled and sagging skin gradually tightened, becoming taut and elastic again—it was as if time was flowing backward on her body. When she straightened up again, she had become a beautiful and attractive woman.



"That's much better to look at," Ferlin said with satisfaction, "I remember this person is... the one who was hanged at the city gate?"



"Yes, my lord," she nodded, "Out of the four people, you spent the most time on her."



"You really know how to please me," the priest smacked his lips, "But Thales is probably coming back soon, and we don't have much time." He suppressed the lust in his heart, "And those fallen ones still need you to deal with them—just like before."



"Leave it to me, my lord," she bowed, "I won't let any fallen witch escape."



About a quarter of an hour later, Thales returned to the secret chamber. He first glanced at the witch, then reported to Ferlin, "My lord, many people are indeed missing from the refugee camp outside the West City Gate. I was afraid it would be too dark to see clearly, so I had my men carry torches and take a look around. Many tents are already empty. However, there was not a single light at the docks, and it's unclear whether the merchant caravan is still stationed there. As for the witches..."



"No need to check," Phyllis interrupted, "if they dare to take away the diseased refugees, the information from Rat should be accurate. With this in mind, this group must have at least two witches, one watching from the sky, and one who can dispel the demonic plague. Especially the latter, it poses a huge threat to my plans and must be stopped." Now that they are still gathering people outside the city, if they bring the witches into the city and openly treat those infected citizens, the 'Holy Spirit Potion' I've been promoting will become a joke!



"What should we do then?" the priest asked, "Send the Judgement Army to capture the witches?"



He shook his head, "This is the King's City, not Hermes Holy City. The church only has a little over twenty members of the Judgement Army. If we send them out, who will maintain order during the distribution of medicine tomorrow? Moreover, if the number is too small, it will not serve any purpose other than to startle the enemy, and even if they could defeat those mercenaries, the witches would probably have already escaped." Precisely because it is the King's City, the Judgement Army responsible for guarding the church is maintained at a scale of just tens of people. Otherwise, a permanent force of several hundred would probably keep the king up at night.



"Then... write to the Holy City and ask the bishop to send reinforcements?" 



"By the time the Judgement Army arrives, the refugees will probably have all gone," Priest Phyllis sneered, "and to deal with a group of mercenaries, there's no need for the church's elite to take action. Leave this matter to the Dream Water."



"Leave it to Rat?" Siatas was taken aback.



"They at least have the numbers, they can surround the dock area in advance and then swarm in. How many mercenaries, who are not wearing armor and only have wooden spears, do you think could handle a few Rats?" he asked in return.



"Probably two to three people."



"So, at most, they can only deal with two to three hundred people, while Dream Water can gather over a thousand thugs under their command. Of course, these violent scum might not be a match for a small squad of the Judgement Army in formation, but they are more than enough to crush a group of unarmored mercenaries," Phyllis stood up, "Take my words to 'Ferocious Fang' Tannis, give him one day to gather people, the more the better, and take action tomorrow night. Do not reveal that there is another way to cure the demonic plague, and do not say it's to deal with witches, just emphasize that he must not let a single person escape. The reward will be a whole box of Holy Spirit Potion. If he wants to shirk or stall, tell him that he can forget about getting poppy flowers and Deep Sleep Ferns from me in the future."



"But what about the witches... What should we do? Especially the one that can fly in the sky."



"She won't be flying around forever, and the rats won't be able to end the battle in a short time, or rather... their role is more to draw the enemy's attention," Phyllis walked up to the witch, reaching out to caress her face, "As long as the Faceless Ones find a gap, they can sneak into the camp, and then the outcome will be beyond doubt."



By touching, one can completely disguise oneself or another person as someone else, not just in appearance, but also in physique and voice, and the disguise cannot be undone by the God's Stone of Retaliation after it takes effect. Such an ability is impeccable for an assassin. It is for this reason that she became one of the few witches that the Church preserved and specifically trained.



"When the enemy realizes they can't win, there will inevitably be chaos in the camp. At that time, the Faceless Ones can ensure that not a single witch survives," the priest said with a smile.
