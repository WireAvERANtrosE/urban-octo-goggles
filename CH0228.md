## Faceless One
The old woman sheathed her dagger, laid the needle on the ground, wiped her body with the medicine bottle, and handed it back to the priest.

"Well done," Feryl nodded. "Drag him out and get rid of the body."

"Yes." Her hoarse voice replied, and she dragged the corpse away effortlessly, not at all like an old woman on her deathbed.

"My lord, do you believe what he said?" After the manager left, Priest Shatas asked, "The caravan being mixed with the witches, and all under the orders of the Lord of Border Town—if I'm not mistaken, isn't that lord the Fourth Prince, Roland Wimbledon?"

"Whether it's true or not, we won't know until we've investigated," Feryl said seriously. "But I think it's unlikely that he lied. Just by watching from the walls for a moment, one can notice the movement of the refugees. If he wanted to fabricate a lie to exchange for the holy medicine, he would at least make up something harder to verify."

"I will send someone to check immediately," the priest bowed.

"Go, and report back to me as soon as you have news."

Feryl slowly walked to the table and sat down, fiddling with the holy medicine in his hand. These refugees were already in his grasp. To control their movements and prevent them from fleeing on their own, after the demonic plague spread, he had instructed the Dreamwater rats to infiltrate among the refugees and spread the news that the church was coming to save them. Just a few more days of endurance, and not only would they receive the redemption of the gods, but they might also be accepted by the church and become part of the capital of Greycastle. As for those lurking rats, most were patients infected with the demonic plague, who would definitely spare no effort to work for their own sake in exchange for the holy spirit potion.

If the rats' intelligence was accurate, these people had been transporting the refugees at least since yesterday, and by the looks of it, they seemed intent on not stopping until they had moved them all, which was a serious hindrance to his own plans. What's more, they were colluding with witches—Feryl believed that the only ones who could cure the demonic plague must also be witches.



"My lord, the body has been dealt with," the old woman tiptoed into the secret chamber. "Has another fallen one appeared?"



"Most likely," said Phyllis in a deep voice, "and there might be more than one." He paused, "There are no outsiders here, no need to continue wearing this hideous guise, it's disgusting to look at."



"Yes."

She bent over, and then her body began to crackle, as if all her bones were rubbing against each other. Her figure grew rapidly, her white hair turned black in the blink of an eye, and her wrinkled and sagging skin gradually tightened, becoming firm and elastic again—it was as if time was flowing backward on her body. When she straightened up again, she had transformed into a beautiful woman.



"That's much better to look at," Phyllis said with satisfaction. "I remember this person is... the one hanged at the city gate?"



"Yes, my lord," she nodded. "Among the four, you spent the most time on her body."



"You really know how to please me," the priest smacked his lips. "But, Shatas is likely to return soon, and we don't have much time." He suppressed the desire in his heart. "And those fallen ones still need your attention—as always."



"Leave it to me, my lord," she bowed, "I won't let any fallen witch escape."



About a quarter of an hour later, Shatas returned to the secret chamber. He first glanced at the witch, then reported to Phyllis: "My lord, indeed, many people are missing from the refugee camp outside the West City Gate. I was afraid it would be too dark to see clearly, so I had my men carry torches to look around. Many tents are now empty. However, there's no sign of light in the dock area, and it's unclear if that caravan is still stationed there. As for the witch..."



"No need to check anymore," Felip interrupted. "Since the other party dares to take away the diseased refugees, the information from the Rat should not be far off. With this in mind, this group must have at least two witches, one watching from the sky, and the other capable of eliminating the demonic plague. Especially the latter, it poses a great threat to my plans and must be stopped." Now that they are still pulling in people outside the city, if they bring the witches into the city and openly treat those infected citizens, the 'Holy Spirit Potion' that I've been promoting will become a joke!



"What should we do then?" the priest asked. "Send the Judgement Army to capture the witches?"



He shook his head. "This is the King's City, not the Holy City of Hermes. The Church only has a little over twenty members of the Judgement Army. If we dispatch them, who will maintain order when we distribute medicine tomorrow? Besides, if the number is too small, other than alarming the enemy, it won't be effective. Even if we could defeat those mercenaries, the witches would likely have already fled." It was precisely because it was the King's City that the Judgement Army assigned to guard the Church was maintained at the scale of only a few dozen people; otherwise, if they permanently stationed a force of several hundred, even the king would lose sleep over it.



"Then... write a letter to the Holy City, asking the bishop to send reinforcements before taking action?"



"By the time the Judgement Army arrives, I'm afraid the refugees will have all gone." Priest Felip sneered. "Besides, dealing with a group of mercenaries doesn't require the Church's elite forces. Leave this matter to the Dream Water."



"Leave it to the Rat?" Shatas was taken aback.



"At least they are numerous and can surround the docks in advance before swarming in. How many Rats do you think unarmored mercenaries wielding wooden spears can handle?" he countered.



"Probably two or three."



"So at most, they can only handle about two hundred people, while the thugs that the Dream Water can gather number over a thousand. Of course, these violent scum might not be a match for a small squad of the Judgement Army in formation, but they are more than enough to crush a group of unarmored mercenaries." Felip stood up. "Take my message to 'Ferocious Fang' Tannis. Give him one day to gather his men, the more the better. We'll make our move tomorrow night. Don't reveal that there are other methods to cure the demonic plague, nor say it's to deal with witches. Just remind him not to let a single person escape. The reward will be a whole box of Holy Spirit Potion. If he wants to shirk or prevaricate, tell him that he won't get any more opium poppy or Long Sleep Fern from me."



"But what about the witch... What do we do? Especially the one who can fly in the sky."

"She won't keep flying forever, and the rats won't be able to end the battle in a short time, or rather... their role is more to attract the enemy's attention," Phyllis walked over to the witch, reaching out to caress her face, "As long as the Faceless One finds an opening to sneak into the camp, the outcome is certain."



By touch, she could disguise herself or someone else entirely as another person, not just in appearance but also in body shape and voice. Moreover, once effective, even the Divine Stone of Judgement couldn't undo it. This ability was impeccable for an assassin. That was why she had become one of the few witches that the Church retained and specially trained.



"When the enemy realizes they cannot win, chaos will inevitably ensue in the camp. At that time, the Faceless One can ensure that not a single witch survives," the priest said with a smile.
