## Blazing Heart
Roland opened his eyes and found himself lying on a soft, large bed, with the familiar ceiling above him where even every crack matched the ones in his memory.

Was this his own... bedroom?

He turned his head and looked at his shoulders—both the left and the right looked intact. He tried moving his hands and found no issue there either.

Everything felt like a dream.

But he knew this was no dream; the scouting of the Devil's and the encounter were real events that had happened! The fact that he was lying safely in his bedroom meant that they had escaped the pursuit of the Devils and had successfully returned to the castle.

However, had all the witches returned safely?

At the thought, Roland's heart sank. He propped himself up, feeling a wave of weakness in his arms. Just as he was about to call out for someone, he noticed a row of witches leaning against the wall at the foot of the bed, including Anna, Nightingale, Lightning, Maggie, and Nana. They were resting against each other's shoulders, breathing steadily with their eyes closed, as if they were sound asleep.

Roland quietly pulled back a corner of the curtain and saw that a touch of dawn was rising from the banks of the Redwater River, spilling dazzling golden light onto the land.

"You... have awakened?"



Turning around, Anna had already opened her eyes without him noticing. Rubbing her sleepy eyes, she walked step by step to Roland's side.

"Uh, I'm awake now. The other witches..."

"They all arrived at the town safely. In fact, you are the only one who was hurt."

"Is that so," Roland breathed a sigh of relief, "that's really good—"

"Fool."

Before he could retort, she had already hugged him tightly, her hands clasped behind his back with such force that they almost seemed to embed into his flesh.

Anna's actions woke the other witches.

"Your Highness!"

They stood up with joy and crowded around, Lightning was the second to hug Roland, followed by Nana and Maggie, Nightingale hesitated for a moment, then embraced everyone from behind. In this way, they all held each other, not willing to let go for a long time... Time seemed to freeze at that moment.



After breakfast, Roland sat in his office and listened to a detailed account of the events to finally understand what had happened.



The witches had joined hands to defeat the devil pursuers and had Lightning and Maggie return ahead of time.



After he himself was brought back to the castle for treatment by Nana Pine, his severed arm was quickly healed as before, but due to the severe blood loss, he had been unconscious for a whole day, so today was already the fourth day since the day of departure.



In hindsight, there was some negligence in this operation. He hadn't expected that the devils would be able to spot the hot air balloon camouflaged against the sky from more than ten miles away. According to Sylvie, that giant multi-eyed demon had not shown any anomalies before, and its eyeballs were looking in all directions. However, when she shifted her focus onto the multi-eyed demon, it immediately reacted, turning all its eyeballs towards her in an instant.



Such a method of scouting was unheard of. At that distance, apart from Sylvie's True Sight, even through a lookout glass, everything was a blur. Furthermore, with the Red Mist obscuring the view above the spire, it was even harder to make out the specifics of the devil. Accordingly, it should have also been difficult for the opponent to detect them.



That being said, although this trip encountered significant danger, the intelligence gathered was also extremely rich.



The devils were no longer mysterious and unknowable messengers of hell—they possessed towns and organizational systems, and like humans, they belonged to a highly evolved civilization group.



Moreover, the enemy's aerial strength was not strong, at least in the area behind the snow-capped mountains. Hundreds of devils emerged from the ground, but in the end, only two of them pursued on mounts, indicating that flying was still a rare ability for them—whether it was due to a scarcity of mounts or riders was still unknown. However, overall, this was good news for Border Town. At least he didn't have to worry about a group of devils bypassing the southern hills and mountains and entering the Western Territory to plunder and slaughter directly.



Furthermore, the fact that devils possess magic power is an important discovery. According to Nightingale's report, although the pursuing enemies had scant magic power, they indeed formed whirlwinds that were very conspicuous in the foggy state. However, their way of invoking magic power seems to be completely different from that of witches; instead of using themselves, they rely on some kind of mechanism—such as the glowing stones to unleash their power. Therefore, their abilities are not as varied as those of witches, but rather more like mass-produced standard weapons.



Of course, these are all conjectures. Unfortunately, the bodies of the devils fell into the sea, so Roland was unable to verify any further.



The last point concerns the buildings. Those short and slender black stone spires are not the dwellings of the devils, and the material is quite peculiar; the surface shows no signs of corrosion by the red mist. Some of the spires are empty inside, while others contain a red liquid, which seems similar to storage tanks.



Could it be that the red mist in the sky is formed by the vaporization of these liquids? And is the reason that the devils have not expanded further into the Barbarian Lands, or even the four major kingdoms, due to the limitations of the gas coverage area?



Regardless, judging from all the intelligence, they do not pose a threat to Border Town's safety for the time being.



However, Roland is also aware that, since they drove humanity out of the Barbarian Lands over four hundred years ago, they might sweep over once again someday, and he must be prepared for that day.



Due to excessive blood loss, Roland only hastily dealt with a few accumulated decrees after nightfall and then went to bed early.



Sitting at the bedside and flipping through half a history book, he was about to blow out the candle and go to sleep when a knock on the door sounded from outside.



He was slightly startled, climbed out of bed, and opened the door. Standing at the doorway was Anna.



She wasn't holding a thick book as usual—neither "Intermediate Physics" nor "The Foundations of Natural Science Theory"—but instead, her hands were empty, and she walked into the room wearing a pure white nightgown. She didn't even wear shoes; her delicate feet lightly touched the floor, so quietly that they made no sound.



Roland swallowed.



Anna closed the door behind her and slid the bolt into place. Then she took Roland's hand and led him to the side of the bed.



The girl's hair had just been washed, and the tips shimmered with a faint golden light under the candlelight. When close, one could smell a faint, enchanting fragrance—not from rose soap, but emanating from her very being.



Her long eyelashes trembled slightly, her cheeks flushed with a rosy hue, and her blue eyes were like serene autumn waters. Although she seemed a bit nervous, there was not the slightest hint of hesitation in her gaze as she looked straight at Roland, filled with determination.



Even he, who had never experienced a major battle, now understood the meaning behind her expression.

"Ahem, this..."

"I don't want to wait any longer," Anna said softly, "especially after going through such an ordeal." She paused, "I don't want to have regrets."
