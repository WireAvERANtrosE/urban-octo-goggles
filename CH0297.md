## Blazing Heart
Roland opened his eyes to find himself lying on a soft, large bed, the ceiling above him familiar, every crack aligning with those in his memory.

Is this my... bedroom?

He turned his head, looking over his shoulders—both left and right seemed intact. He tried moving his hands and encountered no issues.

Everything was like a dream.

But he knew it was not a dream, the scouting devils and the assault had indeed happened! That he was lying safely in his bedroom meant that they had escaped the devils' pursuit and returned to the castle successfully.

However, had all the witches returned safely?

At this thought, Roland's heart couldn't help but sink. He propped himself up, his arms feeling weak and powerless. Just as he was about to call out for someone, he saw a row of witches leaning against the wall at the foot of the bed—Anna, Nightingale, Lightning, Maggie, and Nana. They leaned on each other's shoulders, their breathing steady, eyes gently closed, as if they were sound asleep.

Roland quietly pulled back a corner of the curtain and saw the first light of dawn rising from the banks of the Redwater River, like dazzling golden threads spilling onto the land.

"You... are awake?"



Turning around, Anna had already opened her eyes at some point. She rubbed her bleary eyes and walked step by step to Roland's side.

"Um, I'm awake now. The other witches..."

"They all arrived safely at the town. In fact, you were the only one injured."

"Is that so," Roland let out a sigh of relief, "that's really good—"

"Silly."

Before he could retort, she had already tightly embraced him, the hands locked behind his back so forceful they almost seemed to dig into his flesh.

Anna's actions stirred the other witches awake.

"Your Highness!"

They stood up excitedly, crowding around, with Lightning being the second to hug Roland, followed by Nana and Maggie. Nightingale hesitated for a moment before she gathered everyone into her arms from behind. In this way, they all huddled together, reluctant to let go... Time seemed to freeze at that moment.



After breakfast, Roland listened to the detailed account of events in his office, which clarified what had happened thereafter.

The witches joined hands to defeat the devil pursuers, allowing Lightning and Maggie to return ahead of time with the message.

After being brought back to the castle for treatment by Nana Pine, his severed arm quickly healed as before, but due to severe blood loss, he had been unconscious for a full day, making today the fourth day since the departure.

All in all, this operation was somewhat careless. He had not expected that the devils could detect the hot air balloon camouflaged against the sky from more than ten miles away. According to Sylvie, that huge multi-eyed devil had not shown any abnormalities before, with its eyeballs looking in all directions. However, when she shifted her focus onto it, the creature immediately reacted, turning all its eyeballs towards her.

Such a method of scouting was unheard of. At that distance, aside from Sylvie's Eye of Truth, even through a lookout glass, everything was a blur. Furthermore, with the Red Mist covering above the spire, it was even harder to discern the devils' specific conditions. Accordingly, it should have been very difficult for them to spot her as well.

That said, although this trip encountered significant danger, the intelligence gathered was extremely valuable.

Devils were no longer the mysterious and unknowable messengers from hell—they possessed towns and organizational systems, belonging to a highly evolved civilization just like humans.

Moreover, their aerial strength was not formidable, at least not in the area behind the snowy mountains. Hundreds of devils emerged from the underground, but in the end, only two rode their mounts to pursue, indicating that flight was still a rare ability for them—whether due to a scarcity of mounts or riders was still unknown. However, on the whole, this was good news for Border Town. At the very least, he did not have to worry about a horde of devils bypassing the southern hills and mountains to invade and plunder the western territory directly.



Additionally, the fact that devils possess magic power is an important discovery.

According to Nightingale's report, the pursuing enemies, although sparse in magic power, indeed formed cyclones that were very conspicuous in the mist state. However, their method of activating magic power seems completely different from witches; it's not through themselves but relies on some sort of mechanism — for example, the glowing stone that releases power. Therefore, their abilities are not as varied and flexible as those of witches; they are more like mass-produced standard weapons.

Of course, these are all speculations, and unfortunately, the bodies of the devils all fell into the sea, so Roland was unable to verify this further.

The last point is about architecture.

Those short and slender black stone spires are not dwellings of the devils; the material is also very peculiar, with no signs of corrosion from the red mist on the surface. Some of the spires are empty inside, while others contain a red liquid, somewhat similar to storage tanks.

Could it be that the red mist in the sky is formed by the vaporization of these liquids?

And is it because the range of gas coverage is limited that the devils have not expanded further into the Fertile Plains, or even the Four Kingdoms?

Regardless, taking all the intelligence into account, they do not pose a threat to Border Town for the time being.

However, Roland is also aware that since they drove humanity out of the Fertile Plains over four hundred years ago, they might sweep over once again someday, and he must be prepared for that day.



Due to excessive blood loss, Roland had only hastily dealt with a few accumulated decrees after nightfall before going to bed early. While sitting at the bedside and flipping through half a history book, just as he was preparing to blow out the candle and sleep, a knock sounded from outside the room. He was slightly startled, climbed down from the bed to open the door, and standing at the doorway was Anna.



She was not holding a thick book like usual—neither "Intermediate Physics" nor "The Basics of Natural Science Theory"—but instead entered the room with empty hands, dressed in a white nightgown. She wasn't even wearing shoes; her delicate feet gently touched the floor, silent without a sound.



Roland swallowed.



Anna closed the door behind her and slid the bolt into place. Then she took Roland's hand and walked to the bedside. 



The girl's hair had just been washed, her damp ends reflecting a faint golden light in the candlelight, and as she drew close, a subtle fragrance could be detected—not from rose soap, but emanating from her very self.



Her long eyelashes trembled slightly, her cheeks flushed with redness, and her blue eyes were like a pool of autumn water. Although she appeared somewhat nervous, there was not an ounce of hesitation in her gaze as she looked straight at Roland, filled with determination.



Even he, who had never experienced a major battle, understood the meaning conveyed by the other party at this moment.

"Ahem, this..."

"I don't want to wait any longer," Anna said softly, "especially after such an ordeal." She paused, "I don't want to have regrets."
