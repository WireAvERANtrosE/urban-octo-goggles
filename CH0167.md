## Victory and Defeat
The competition site was located at the foot of the western town wall.

Aside from Roland, the spectators included Iron Axe, Titus, Brian, and all the members of the Witch Union.

Plus, a fat pigeon squatting on the watchtower.

To avoid accidental injuries from bullets, everyone had to go up on the wall to watch. The two competitors—Chief Knight Carter Lannis and the Extraordinary Witch Ashes—would engage in a one-on-one contest within a closer range of the wall.

Carter was not in his usual knight's armor but had switched to a form-fitting leather outfit that allowed for easier movement, with a specially custom-made gun holster belt around his waist, each side holding a revolving pistol. There was also a short knife placed horizontally at the back of his waist for emergency use. But Roland knew that if it came down to using a knife to fight an Extraordinary, it would be better to admit defeat directly.

Ashes was dressed as usual, a black robe covering her body, with her long black hair tied into a ponytail that naturally fell behind her, seemingly unconcerned with the extra weakness this might present. The only difference was her greatsword, the wrapped cloth had been removed to reveal a dark brown blade almost devoid of luster. As Roland had guessed, the surface of the sword was uneven and did not look like a finely crafted weapon, and due to lack of maintenance, rust spots had appeared where notches had been made.

The two entered the field, with Carter constantly adjusting his position until he was more than fifteen meters away from his opponent. At this distance, he was over eighty percent confident about hitting a stationary target. Taking out two pistols, he checked the bullets and the firing ports one last time.

Roland had Echo amplify his voice, "The rules of the competition are simple: stop when you touch, no hitting in the head, and you can admit defeat! As long as it's not an immediate death, Nana's healing abilities can quickly restore you to your original state. Any questions?" He waited a moment, and seeing no objections from either party, he continued, "The competition begins when you hear the bell ring!"

Ashes silently sized up her opponent. As an Extraordinary, she usually fought by following her instincts and, after following Tilly, had learned combat techniques from the court's swordsmanship masters. However, she always felt that these techniques were of little help to her. Her opponent was the Chief Knight by the prince's side, yet he did not carry the common sword, shield, or spear, and he was not even wearing armor. The weapons in his hands were extremely strange, but judging by their shape, they were clearly not close-combat weapons like daggers, so there was only one possibility left: they must be similar to hand crossbows, a type of long-range striking weapon.



The crossbow posed no threat to the Extraordinaries; this was a conclusion Ashes had drawn from numerous battles. If it were a light crossbow, she could even catch the bolts with her bare hands. However, given the prince's solemn assurance, the weapon in his hands was certainly not as simple as a crossbow.



Her instincts told her that she must close in on the knight quickly rather than waiting on the periphery for the opponent to attack first. Therefore, before the duel began, Ashes thrust the front part of her long sword into the ground. This posture seemed nonthreatening, yet it was the most effective way to deal with a crossbowman.



At that moment, a crisp bell rang from the city wall.



Almost simultaneously, Ashes made her move. She gripped the hilt with both hands and fiercely thrust forward. Soil, grass roots, and gravel were lifted into the air with the broad blade, flying toward the direction of the knight, forming a smokescreen of mud and dust.



Chief Knight Carter reacted swiftly as well. His weapon burst into flames and emitted a loud boom, but Ashes saw nothing—either the opponent had not loaded a bolt, or the bolt was already so close that she could not perceive it. She was more inclined to believe the latter rather than the former, which was nearly a foolish mistake.



Under the cover of the mud and dust smokescreen, Ashes sprinted from the side, closing half the distance between them in the blink of an eye, while the smokescreen had not yet fully settled. Most people would instinctively dodge the overwhelming mud debris, and as long as she could interrupt the opponent's continuous shooting, she would win by a large margin.



But Carter didn't move from his spot, disregarding the dirt hitting his face, squinting his eyes as he aimed his weapon at the approaching Extraordinary and pulled the trigger again—the roaring sound accompanied by a flash of light as Ashes reflexively stepped to the side, yet still saw no bolt being projected, nor did the knight make any preparatory actions like drawing a bowstring.



This new type of weapon might be capable of continuous firing, but missing two shots in a row meant the outcome was decided!



The final ten steps also took but a blink of an eye. She raised her long sword vertically in front of her, pushed off the ground with both feet, and charged at the knight like a bull—such a collision would not be instantly fatal, but it would be enough to knock him unconscious. Even if he managed to stay conscious through sheer willpower, the shattered bones in his chest would completely deprive him of his ability to fight. And in that final breath, the opponent's third attack exploded in front of Ashes. She only felt a fierce vibration on her sword, followed by a clear ringing sound, and then a numbness in her right flank, as if something had viciously clawed at her.



Almost simultaneously, she crashed into Carter's chest, sending him flying backward in an arc before he rolled onto the ground.

Only then did she have the opportunity to check the wound at her waist. But as she looked down, a strong wave of dizziness hit her brain, and she staggered, nearly falling to the ground—the extraordinary power that had surged through her like a torrent was now fleeing, making her limbs feel unbearably heavy.

Ashes used her longsword to support herself, the numbness of her wound turning into a burning pain, as if a portion of her waist was missing. She could even see her own crimson innards. Only by clenching her teeth could she prevent herself from collapsing.

...

In Roland's eyes, the entire duel lasted only four to five seconds. He saw the extraordinary witch, Ashes, kick up dirt and debris as she charged at Carter from the other side, changing direction once in the process before crashing into the knight. Before being sent flying, Carter managed to fire three bullets—a point that surprised Roland.

Facing the exceedingly swift Ashes would make it hard for anyone to even keep track of her shadow, let alone aim and shoot. That Carter could do so already proved that his title of Chief Knight was well-deserved. The first two missed shots were only to be expected. In fact, if Ashes had changed direction a few more times at that speed, Carter might not have been able to hit her at all. The key was the third shot, a straight-line charge with her greatsword held in front of her chest in the last five or six meters.

If it had been a crossbow—even a heavy one—at this distance, it would have at most embedded into the longsword, leaving the Extraordinary unharmed. But the 12mm caliber ammunition combined with a steel bullet head unleashed unparalleled power at this range. At that moment, Roland only saw black fragments flying, and a cloud of blood burst from Ashes' side. When she finally stood still, the prince saw that half of her waist had been blown away, as if gnawed by a demonic beast, with intestines slipping out and hanging by her side. The lower half of the greatsword had a bowl-shaped notch, likely where the bullet hit the iron sword before passing through it. The unstable bullet head and the shattered iron fragments, spinning together, burrowed into her side, ripping open a huge wound.

Despite the grave injury, she did not faint but insisted on standing in the field—an Extraordinary witch's physical resilience was indeed terrifying. If it had been a lead bullet or a smaller caliber, she might have been able to endure it with her body's toughness. Maggie was the first to rush to Ashes' side, attempting to support her, but due to her small stature, she could only hug her legs, looking anxious.

Nana had already gone to treat Carter, and Roland also quickly walked up to the struggling Ashes.



She seemed to have been waiting just for this moment.

"I won..." she said, and before Roland could react, Ashes collapsed right onto his shoulder.
