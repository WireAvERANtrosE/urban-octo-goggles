## Victory or Defeat
The competition took place at the base of the western town wall.

In addition to Roland, the onlookers included Iron Axe, Titus, Barov, and all members of the Witch Union.

Plus, a fat pigeon squatting on the lookout tower.

To avoid accidental injuries from bullets, everyone had to watch from atop the wall. The two competitors—Chief Knight Carter Lannis and the Extraordinary Witch Ashes—would engage in a one-on-one contest within a closer range of the wall.

Carter was not dressed in his usual knightly armor but in a form-fitting leather outfit that allowed for easier movement. At his waist was a specially made gun belt, with a revolver holstered on each side. Additionally, a dagger was horizontally placed at his lower back for emergency use. However, Roland knew that if it came down to fighting an Extraordinary with a dagger, it would be better to concede defeat outright.

Ashes was dressed as usual, in a black robe that concealed her body, with her long black hair tied into a ponytail that naturally fell behind her, seemingly unconcerned about creating any unnecessary weaknesses for herself. The only difference was her greatsword, whose wrapped cloth had been removed, revealing a dark brown blade almost devoid of luster. As Roland expected, the sword's surface was rough and uneven, not looking like a weapon crafted with care, and due to lack of maintenance, the notched areas had begun to rust.

The two entered the field, and Carter kept adjusting his position until he was more than fifteen meters away from his opponent. At this distance, he was more than 80 percent confident with a stationary target. He took out two revolvers and gave one last check to the bullets and the firing pan.

Roland had Echo amplify his voice, "The rules of the competition are simple: stop at the touch, no hitting the head, and you can admit defeat! As long as it's not fatal on the spot, Nana's healing abilities can quickly restore you to your original state. Any questions?" After a brief pause, seeing no objections from either party, he continued, "The competition will begin at the sound of the bell!"

Ashes silently sized up her opponent. As an Extraordinary, she mostly fought by following her instincts, and although she had learned combat techniques from the court's sword masters after following Tilly, she always felt that these techniques were of little help to her. Her opponent was the prince's Chief Knight, but he didn't carry the common sword and shield or spear, nor did he wear any armor. The weapons in his hands were extremely strange, but based on their shape, they clearly could not be considered close-range weapons like daggers. Therefore, there was only one possibility left—they must be similar to a hand crossbow, a type of long-range striking weapon.



Crossbows posed no threat to the Extraordinaries, a conclusion Ashes had drawn from multiple battles. If it were a light crossbow, she could even catch the bolts barehanded. However, judging by the prince's confident demeanor, the weapon in his hand was certainly not as simple as a crossbow.



Her instincts told her that she needed to close the distance with the knight quickly, rather than waiting on the periphery for him to make the first move. Thus, before the duel began, Ashes thrust the front part of her long sword into the ground, adopting a posture that seemed non-threatening, yet it was the most effective way to deal with a crossbowman.



At that moment, a crisp bell rang from the city walls.



Ashes acted almost simultaneously. She gripped the hilt of her sword and flipped it forward vigorously, sending mud, grass roots, and stones into the air along with the broad blade, creating a smokescreen of debris flying towards the direction of the knight.



The Chief Knight reacted swiftly as well. His weapon burst into flames and roared loudly, but Ashes saw nothing—either the opponent had not loaded an arrow, or the arrow was so fast that she couldn't detect it. Preferring the latter explanation over the almost foolish former, she advanced.



Under the cover of the smokescreen, Ashes sprinted from the side. The distance between them was halved in the blink of an eye, while the debris screen had not yet fully settled. Ordinary people would instinctively dodge the overwhelming mud and sand; as long as she could interrupt his shooting, she would win by a large margin.



But Carter did not move from his spot, disregarding the dirt hitting his face, squinting as he aimed his weapon at the approaching Extraordinary and pulled the trigger again—thunderous noise and a flash of light ensued. Ashes reflexively stepped to the side, still not seeing the projected arrow, and the knight made no preparation like drawing the bowstring to reload.



This new type of weapon could probably fire continuously, but after two missed shots, the outcome was clear!



The final ten steps were also covered in the blink of an eye. Ashes held her long sword vertically in front of her and pushed off the ground with both feet, charging at the knight like a bull—the impact would not kill him instantly but was enough to knock him unconscious. Even if he remained conscious through sheer will, the shattered bones in his chest would completely incapacitate him. In that final breath, the opponent's third attack exploded in front of Ashes. She only felt a fierce shake on her sword, a clear ring, and then a numbness in her right abdomen, as if something had harshly grasped her.



Almost at the same time, she crashed into Carter's chest, sending him flying through the air in an arc before he tumbled to the ground.

Only then did she take the time to check the wound at her waist. But just as she looked down, a strong sense of dizziness surged through her brain. She staggered twice and nearly fell to the ground—the strength brought by her extraordinary magic was fading away like water, and her limbs felt incredibly heavy.

Ashes used her longsword to support her body, as the numbness at her wound turned into a burning pain. It was as if a part of her waist was missing, and she could even see her own bright red innards. Only by clenching her teeth could she keep herself from collapsing.

...

In Roland's eyes, the entire duel lasted only four or five seconds. He saw the extraordinary witch Ashes kick up dirt and debris as she charged at Carter from the other side, changing direction once in the middle, before slamming hard into the knight. Carter managed to fire three bullets before being struck—this alone was beyond Roland's expectations.

Facing the exceptionally swift Ashes, it would be difficult for him to even keep his eyes on her, let alone aim and shoot. That he did so was enough to prove that the title of Chief Knight was no empty honor. The first two missed shots were only to be expected. In fact, if Ashes had changed directions a few more times at that speed, Carter might not have been able to hit her at all. The key was the third shot, which came at a distance of the last five or six meters, when Ashes held her greatsword in front of her chest in a straight-line charge.

If it had been a crossbow—even a heavy crossbow—at that moment, it could at most have lodged in the greatsword, having no effect on the Extraordinary. But the 12mm caliber ammunition combined with a steel bullet head unleashed incomparable power at that distance. At that moment, Roland only saw black fragments flying, with a cloud of blood bursting from Ashes' side. When she finally stood still, the prince realized that half of her waist had been blown off, as if bitten by a demonic beast, with intestines slipping out and hanging by her side. There was a bowl-shaped notch at the lower part of the greatsword, likely where the bullet had hit the iron sword and then passed through it. The unstable bullet head and the flying iron fragments spiraled into her side, tearing open a huge wound.

Even with severe injuries, she did not faint but instead insisted on standing in the arena—indeed, the physical condition of an Extraordinary witch was terrifyingly high. If it had been a lead bullet or a small caliber bullet head, she might have been able to withstand it with her body. Maggie was the first to rush to Ashes' side, wanting to support her, but unfortunately, her short stature meant she could only hug her legs, her face filled with anxiety.

Nana had already gone to treat Carter, and Roland also quickly walked up to the struggling Ashes.



She seemed to be waiting for just this moment.

"I won..." After saying this, without waiting for any reaction from Roland, Ashes collapsed straight onto his shoulder.
