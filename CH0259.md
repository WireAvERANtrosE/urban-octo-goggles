## Witch from the Sleeping Island (Part 2)
The fourth one is Sylvie.

Whenever Roland faced this witch, he always felt a bit uneasy. It wasn't because Nightingale said she lied too much—in modern society, apart from family and close friends, hardly anyone spoke their mind without reservation. He was accustomed to the various embellished flattery and rumors.

He just felt as if he had nowhere to hide in front of her, and what was worse, he knew this wasn't an illusion but rather her actual ability. Her vision could ignore obstacles; as long as she wished, clothes on one's body might as well be non-existent. While Roland inwardly lamented not having such an ability, he involuntarily changed his sitting posture, crossing his legs.



In terms of appearance, she was the most unique among the five witches: her long, emerald-green hair cascaded down to her shoulders, with slender eyebrows faintly visible beneath her straight bangs. Especially striking were her amber-colored eyes, so clear they almost lacked depth, reflecting all light like mirrors. If he looked long enough, Roland felt like a red mark might suddenly appear in them.



Sylvie's ability was quite easy to understand; she could see all the scenery within her vicinity—including behind her—and her vision could penetrate obstacles. How deep she could see depended on her thoughts. Additionally, she possessed a branch ability similar to Nightingale's: she could see the convergence and dissipation of magic power.



This slightly surprised Roland. If branch abilities could be so closely related, what about the main abilities? He posed this question to Sylvie, who hesitated before saying that among the hundreds of witches on Sleeping Island, none had been found with identical abilities. Nightingale's pinch on the left side confirmed this statement as the truth.



It's probably because the sample size is too small, Roland thought.



The last witch to appear was Candle.

Like Anna, she had reached her adult day during the previous year's Evil Months. Before she came of age, her ability could only affect lighting materials such as candles, kerosene, and torches. After reaching adulthood, her magic stabilized, and its effects greatly enhanced. She could maintain the original properties of an object she touched for a period of time—for example, after applying her ability to a block of ice, it would not melt under the sun and would continue to emit waves of cold air.



At first glance, this ability seemed incredible, enabling many things that conventional methods could not achieve. However, after several rounds of testing, Roland found it was not as perfect as he had imagined. First of all, it belonged to a type of enchantment ability, which required direct contact with the target. This limitation made it difficult for Candle to solidify some high-temperature objects.



Thus, his attempt to obtain a drop of steel that remained perpetually incandescent, which could continuously provide a heat source for the blast furnace, was doomed to failure. Aside from Anna, no one dared to touch something that was thousands of degrees with their hands. While Candle could hold one end of a thin iron wire to enchant it, this led to another problem.



The farther the object's solidified state was from its normal state, the greater the magic power consumed, and the shorter the duration of the effect.



Roland verified this with ice blocks—the same size ice blocks after solidification, one placed on scorching ground and the other thrown into a basin of water. The former only lasted half an hour before quickly melting, while the latter still maintained its original shape even after cooling the water to a chilly temperature.



This meant that if it were to be a red-hot iron wire or steel bar, the effect would only be worse.



Lastly, volume was also a factor that restricted the performance of Candle's ability. Like Hummingbird and Miya, the larger the object to be enchanted, the more magic power was consumed. According to Nightingale's observation, her own magic power was below average, like a golden mist rather than a dense cyclone.



Nevertheless, even so, this somewhat introverted girl was still Roland's greatest gain—in the field of industrial production, the ability to solidify the state of an object was an invaluable treasure. The key lay in the term "normal state." Metals fatigue due to heating, cooling, friction, and force, and structures deform. He didn't need a drill bit that became scorching due to friction, nor did he need gears that wore out over time. If the key parts of a machine could always maintain their normal state, it would mean that the machine could always operate at maximum efficiency and highest precision.



In other words, Blaze could effectively improve the mechanical strength of inferior metals.



Back in the castle office, Roland reviewed the recorded abilities once more, then started to plan their future work content.



"How about it," Nightingale poked her head out of the Mist, "do you have a favorite among these five witches?"



"They are all pretty good," Roland replied casually.



"What! You like them all?"



He glared at her, and she stuck out her tongue, walked away with a piece of dried fish.



Evidently, at the moment, the most useful were Lotus and Candle.



With the ability to modify terrain, he could easily build a new earth wall outside the city walls—the original rubble cement wall had been built at the narrowest point between the northern slope of the mountain and the Redwater River to save materials and speed up construction, allowing completion before the Evil Months arrived, but this also limited the town's expansion to the west. As the population continued to grow, developing this wilderness and the Misty Forest was only a matter of time.



The new earth wall would extend to the outer edge of the Misty Forest, simultaneously encompassing a section of the woods, thus nearly doubling the town's area. As for the extended defensive line, it could be addressed by expanding the military and artificially directing the demonic beasts' assault. In any case, compared to last year's wooden spears and muzzle-loading muskets, the First Army's projectile firepower had undergone a revolutionary change, and defensive measures such as artillery batteries and bastions could also be completed alongside the new city wall.



Besides that, he also planned to have Lotus open a passage at the southern mountains, allowing Border Town direct access to the shallows. With that, the town would gain a natural harbor, making trade with the fjords even more convenient. Considering the huge magical power consumption required to transform the rock layer, this project might take several months to complete.



Candle's job was to collaborate with Anna and Lucia in creating a new generation of machine tools for the production of firearms and other mechanical equipment. If all went well, Anna could also be freed from the monotonous and tedious work of processing and production.



Sylvie's task was very clear: mainly to explore the North Slope Mines and the Misty Forest. According to the miners, there were more than a hundred natural caves in the North Slope Mines, and no one knew where they ultimately led. So far, only about twenty passages had been mined and cleared, and several types of ore had already been discovered. Roland was very curious about how much credibility the rumors of the so-called ancient monster lairs held. Now that he had a witch with clairvoyance, he wanted to thoroughly explore the North Slope mining area, draw a detailed map, and have Lily adjust the terrain to improve mining efficiency.



As for Honey, Roland didn't have too many ideas; it was simply to strengthen his ability to transmit information in an era without radio. He needed a large number of well-trained birds to act as carrier pigeons, not requiring them to be as smart as Maggie, but just to deliver intelligence into his hands as quickly as possible.
