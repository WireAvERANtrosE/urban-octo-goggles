## Witch from Sleeping Island (Part 2)
The fourth is Sylvie.

When facing this witch, Roland always felt somewhat uneasy, not because Nightingale said she told too many lies. In modern society, aside from family members and close friends, there are very few people who are completely candid. He was already accustomed to the various embellished flattery and rumors. 

He just felt that in front of her, there was a sensation of being completely exposed, and what was worse, he knew this was not an illusion but rather a result of her ability. Her vision could ignore obstacles, and if she wished, clothes might as well not exist on one's body. While Roland inwardly sighed about why he did not possess such an ability, he involuntarily changed his sitting position, crossing his legs.

In terms of appearance, she could be considered the most unique among these five witches: a head of emerald-green hair that fell to her shoulders, with delicate and long eyebrows that appeared faint beneath her bangs. Especially those amber-colored eyes, so clear they seemed almost depthless, as if reflecting all light like mirrors. After gazing into them for a while, Roland always felt like a red mark would suddenly appear within them.

Sylvie's ability was fairly easy to understand; she could see all the scenery within her vicinity—including behind her—and her vision could penetrate obstacles, with the depth depending on her will. Additionally, she possessed a branch ability similar to Nightingale: the ability to see the convergence and dissipation of magic power.

This slightly surprised Roland. If branch abilities could be so closely related, what about the primary abilities? He asked Sylvie this question, and after hesitating, she said that among the hundreds of witches on Sleeping Island, no one with the exact same ability had been found, and Nightingale softly pinched her left side to confirm the truth of this statement.

It's probably because the sample size is too small, Roland thought.

The last witch to make an appearance was Candle.

Like Anna, she had her coming-of-age day during the previous Evil Months. As a minor, her ability could only affect lighting objects such as candles, lamp oil, and torches, but after reaching adulthood and stabilizing her magic power, the effect was greatly enhanced. She could maintain the original properties of an object she touched for a period of time—for example, after casting on an ice cube, it would not melt under the sun, and would still emit waves of cold air.



This ability seemed incredible at first glance, capable of achieving many things that conventional methods could not. However, after several rounds of testing, Roland found that it was not as perfect as he had imagined. First of all, it belonged to a type of enchanting ability that required direct contact with the target, a limitation that made it difficult for Candle to solidify some high-temperature objects.



Thus, his ambitious plan to obtain a drop of steel that would remain incandescent forever, providing a constant source of heat for the blast furnace, fell through. Aside from Anna, no one dared to touch something that was thousands of degrees hot with their hands. While Candle could hold one end of a thin iron wire and enchant it, this led to another problem.



That is, the further the solidified state of an object was from its normal state, the more magical power it consumed, and the shorter the duration of the effect.



Roland verified this with ice cubes—the same size ice cubes were solidified, one placed on the scorching ground and the other dropped into a basin of water. The former only lasted half an hour before quickly melting, while the latter still maintained its original shape even after cooling the water to an icy temperature.



This meant that if it were replaced with red-hot iron wires or steel bars, the effect would only be worse.



Finally, volume was also a factor that constrained the potential of Candle's ability. Like Hummingbird and Miya, the larger the volume of the object being enchanted, the more magical power was consumed. According to Nightingale's observations, her own magical power was below average, resembling a golden mist rather than a dense cyclone.



Nevertheless, even so, this somewhat introverted girl was still Roland's greatest gain—in the field of industrial production, the ability to solidify the state of objects was an invaluable treasure, with the key lying in the term "normal state." Subjected to heating, cooling, friction, and stress, metals would fatigue, and structures would deform. He did not need drill bits that became scorching hot due to friction, nor did he need gears that wore out over time. If the key parts of a machine could maintain their normal state indefinitely, it would mean that the machine could always operate at maximum efficiency and precision.



In other words, Candle could effectively improve the mechanical strength of inferior metals.

...



Back in the castle office, Roland reviewed the abilities he had recorded, then began planning their future work content.



"How about it," Nightingale poked her head out of the Mist, "do you have a particular favorite among these five witches?"



"They are all pretty good," Roland responded casually.



"What! You like all of them?"



He gave her a look, and she stuck out her tongue, walking away with a piece of dried fish in her mouth.



Clearly, for the time being, the most useful were Lotus and Candle.



With the ability to remodel terrain, he could easily build a new earth wall outside the city walls—the original rubble cement walls were built near the narrow pass closest to the Redwater River at the foot of the northern slope to save materials and speed up construction. Although this approach ensured completion before the Evil Months, it also limited the town's expansion to the west. As the population continued to grow, developing the wilderness and the Misty Forest was just a matter of time.



The new earth wall would extend to the edge of the Misty Forest, including a section of the woods, which would nearly double the town's area. As for the extended defensive line, this could be addressed by expanding the source of troops and artificially directing the direction of demonic beast attacks. In any case, compared to last year's wooden spears and muzzle-loading muskets, the First Army's firepower had undergone a drastic transformation. The defense measures such as artillery batteries and bastions could also be completed along with the new city wall.



In addition, he planned to have Lotus open a passage through the southern mountains, allowing Border Town to directly reach the shallows. This way, the town would have access to a natural harbor, making trade with the Fjords even more convenient. Considering the huge magical power consumption required to remodel the rock layer, this project might take several months to complete.



Candle's task was to cooperate with Anna and Lucia to produce a new generation of machine tools for the manufacture of firearms and other mechanical equipment. If everything went smoothly, Anna could also be freed from the tedious and monotonous processing and production.



Sylvie's mission was very clear, mainly to survey the North Slope Mine and the Misty Forest. According to the miners, there were more than a hundred natural caves in the North Slope Mine, and no one knew where they ultimately led to. So far, only about twenty tunnels had been mined and cleared, and several types of ore had already been discovered. Roland was very curious about how much truth there was in the rumors of the so-called ancient monsters' nests. Now with the witches who had the ability to see through objects, he wanted to completely explore the North Slope mining area, draw a detailed map, and incidentally have Lotus adjust the terrain to improve mining efficiency.



As for Honey, Roland didn't have too many thoughts about it; he simply wanted to strengthen his ability to transmit information in an era without radio. He needed a large number of well-trained birds to act as carrier pigeons. He didn't expect them to be as intelligent as Maggie; as long as they could quickly get the intelligence back to him, that would be enough.
