## Town Construction Plan
"What is this?" Nightingale asked as she looked at the shiny black stone on the table.



"Obsidian." Roland didn't look up, focusing on the blueprint in his hands.



"Black... what stone?"



"No, I'm just talking nonsense." He sighed. Just by looking at the shape and color, who knows what kind of stone this is. He wasn't a geologist; he might not even be able to distinguish pure metals if they were put in front of him, let alone ore. The little knowledge in his head was telling him that most ores are complex compounds with different impurities changing their colors. Take iron ore, for instance—hematite, pyrite, and siderite look completely different, especially pyrite, which can sometimes have a light yellow metallic luster and is often mistaken for gold, hence its nickname "fool's gold."



As for high temperature resistance... Compounds don't have a fixed melting point, which also relates to impurities and composition. Temperature alone can't differentiate the types. And since metal elements exist in ionic states, without knowing the purification method, simply burning them is useless.



"You don't know something?" Nightingale expressed her surprise.



"There's plenty I don't know," Roland put down his quill and made himself a cup of tea, "Do you want some?"



"No need," she waved her hand, "Also, beef jerky isn't as tasty as dried fish slices. You should keep fish slices in your drawer in the future."



"..." Roland fell silent for a moment, deciding to pretend he hadn't heard her comment. He planned to hand this stone over to Chief Alchemist Kyle Sichi to deal with. Minerals have a certain level of radioactivity, after all, and it wasn't a good idea to keep one as an ornament in the office.



Recently, after the evolution of Soraya's abilities, he found that the number of things she could create had suddenly increased a lot.

Firstly, there was the water supply system, which could greatly enhance the happiness of the residents. Imagine, after a busy day, returning home drenched in sweat, wanting to wash off the sticky body, only to find that the water tank is empty, and having to fetch water from the nearby well. This feeling must be terribly bad. Moreover, Roland was also very annoyed with the process of scooping water from the tank to wash his face and hands; he always felt that water left in the tank for a few days could grow parasites, not to mention that the water tank was rarely cleaned once a month. If you look carefully, you could even see the sediment at the bottom of the tank moving like caterpillars.

If a water tower was used to supply water, there was no technical difficulty involved—using the steam engine to pump water from the Redwater River into the water tower, then relying on the siphon principle to flow through the pipes into each household, a complete automatic water supply system would be formed. The reason Roland had not implemented it yet was... materials.

The pipes for water supply had to be made of either iron or copper. Iron pipes without anti-rust treatment would be scrapped after a few years of use. Copper pipes, on the other hand, were perfect for water pipes, being corrosion-resistant, not scaling on the inner wall, non-toxic, and even having bactericidal effects due to copper ions. But to use the metal used for casting currency for water pipes? The output from the North Slope Mine was far from luxurious to that extent, and even in later generations, copper pipes were only considered for high-end residences.

Currently, not only could Border Town not export minerals, but it also had to import metal ingots. Therefore, whether it was iron or copper pipes, Roland was reluctant to use them to create a water supply system that could not generate profits and was purely for enjoyment.

But now it was different, with Soraya's coating, it meant that he could make something out of nothing, producing water pipes using only magic power—for example, taking an iron pipe as a mold, wrapping it with paper, letting Soraya cover it with a coating, and then removing the mold to form a pipe. Even if such pipes were not pressure-resistant, they could be placed in a covered pipe trench.

The next thing was the power supply system... This might not be popularized throughout the town in a short time, but filling the castle with light had always been something Roland wanted to achieve. It was really painful to read by the weak light of candles, and it caused tremendous damage to the eyes. Moreover, with summer approaching, what would it feel like to light torches and candles in the hot and stuffy nights?

Now, with the generator and electrical wires, it seemed not so far-fetched for the castle to enter the era of electricity ahead of time. As for the filament of the light bulb... he vaguely remembered that before tungsten filaments were used, people commonly used carbonized bamboo filaments to make incandescent lamps. Bamboo was not a rare thing; there was plenty south of the Redwater River.

However, what Border Town needed most at the moment was iron smelting facilities. The production of iron was directly related to the scale of mechanical production and weapon manufacturing, and it was the foundation of the town's survival.



"Is this... a tower that you're sketching?" Nightingale asked curiously as she sat at the edge of the table.



"Something like that," Roland nodded, "But the inside is hollow, meant for filling with fuel and ores, functioning like a blast furnace to smelt iron ore into pig iron."



This was the blast furnace—an upgraded version of the ancient shaft furnace.



He had once observed the construction site of the shaft furnaces designed by Lucia, and to be honest, apart from their small capacity and lower temperatures, their structure was already very close to that of a blast furnace. If it weren't for Soraya's evolution, which granted the town the ability to produce refractory bricks, he had planned to build about a dozen more of such shaft furnaces.



But with refractory bricks available, naturally, he had to consider blast furnaces that could achieve higher temperatures and larger output.



The new design for the blast furnace was nearly eight meters tall, four times the height of a shaft furnace; the furnace body was tower-shaped, with the largest internal diameter at three meters. To prevent collapse, a support frame was installed at the bottom. The walls of the furnace were thinner at the top and thicker at the bottom, with the belly of the furnace reaching half a meter in thickness, lined with the innermost layer made of Soraya-brand coated refractory bricks. There was also a ring of air inlets, with a steam engine drawing air into the belly of the furnace.



To make full use of the power of the steam engine, Roland also designed an automatic feeding mechanism for the blast furnace that included a climbing rail and a specially made feed cart with a movable door at the bottom. When the cart, pulled by the steam engine, climbed to the top of the furnace, the latch at the bottom would be hooked, opening the feed port and allowing the fuel or ore to be poured into the furnace. For this era, this system was considered cutting-edge technology.



Unlike the shaft furnace with its large opening and low heat, once the blast furnace began production, it would operate for a long period without stopping, requiring a constant input of fuel and ore, and its output was much higher than that of a shaft furnace. With just five or six such blast furnaces, the town's pig iron production would increase exponentially.

...



After finishing all the drawings, Roland rubbed his somewhat sore wrist and moved a box from under the table, pushing it towards her.



Nightingale blinked in surprise. "What is this...?"



"Um... I had planned to give this to you earlier, but carving the patterns took some time. After all, I'm not too familiar with those machines in the factory," Roland said with a smile. "Open it and take a look."



She reached out to open the box and couldn't help but exclaim in admiration.



Inside, two revolving pistols were placed in an interlocking arrangement—different from the prototype gun used during the day of the contest with Carter, these two pistols gleamed with a silvery light, their surfaces so polished they could reflect someone's figure. Both the grip and the body were engraved with exquisite patterns, and the barrels were inscribed with Nightingale's name: "To Veronica."



This plan had been brewing in Roland's mind for a long time. Compared to the inconvenient and troublesome muzzle-loading flintlock, the newly developed revolving pistol had been considerably perfected, maintaining high levels of safety and firing rates. For a witch like Nightingale, who possessed extremely high mobility, the power that firearms could unleash in her hands was something to look forward to with anticipation.



"Thank you," she said with a smile, picking up the two pistols, jumping off the table, and posing as if to fire, "Will you teach me how to use them?"



"Of course," Roland nodded, as her pristine white assassin's outfit combined with a dazzlingly bright smile instantly made him understand what it meant to be so cool you have no friends. "It's not difficult. Just sneak up close to the target, pull the trigger, and shout 'Noon is upon you!' as you do it."
