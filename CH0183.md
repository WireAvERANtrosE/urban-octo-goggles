## Town Construction Plan
"What is this?" Nightingale asked, looking at the shiny black stone on the table.

"Obsidian." Roland replied without looking up, focused on the blueprint in his hands.

"Black... what stone?"

"No, I'm talking nonsense." He sighed. Just by its shape and color, who knows what kind of stone it is. He's not a geologist. Even with pure metals in front of him, he might not be able to identify them, let alone ores. The little knowledge in his head told him that most ores are complex compounds with different impurities, and their colors vary accordingly. Take iron ore for example, with hematite, pyrite, and siderite looking completely different in appearance. Especially pyrite, which sometimes has a pale yellow metallic luster and is often mistaken for gold ore, hence the nickname 'fool's gold'.

As for high-temperature resistance... Compounds don't have a fixed melting point, which also depends on impurities and composition. Temperature alone cannot distinguish the type. And since metal elements exist in an ionic state, without knowing the purification method, melting it would be useless.

"You don't know something?" Nightingale asked in surprise.

"There's a lot I don't know," Roland replied, putting down his quill and making himself a cup of black tea. "Would you like some?"

"No need," she waved her hand, "by the way, beef jerky is not as tasty as fish fillets. You should keep fish fillets in your drawer in the future."

"..." Roland was silent for a moment, deciding to pretend he hadn't heard that last remark. He also planned to hand over the stone to the Chief Alchemist, Kyle Sichi, to deal with. Minerals have a certain level of radioactivity, so keeping it in the office as a decoration was not a good choice.



Recently, after Soraya's ability evolved, he found that he could create many more things.



Firstly, there is the tap water system, which can greatly improve the happiness of the residents. Imagine coming home sweaty after a busy day, wanting to wash the sticky sweat off your body, only to find that the water tank is empty and you have to go to the nearby well to fetch water. This feeling is definitely terrible. Moreover, Roland also detests the process of scooping water from the tank to wash his face and hands. He always feels that if the water is left in the tank for a few days, it can grow parasites. Not to mention that the water tank is rarely cleaned once a month. If you look carefully, you can even see the sediment at the bottom of the tank wriggling like caterpillars.



If we use a water tower for water supply, there is no technical difficulty—using a steam engine to pump water from the Redwater River into the water tower, and then relying on the siphon principle to flow through the pipes into every household, a complete automatic water supply system would be formed. The reason why Roland has not implemented this is... materials.



Water pipes must be made of either iron or copper. Iron pipes, if not treated for rust prevention, will have to be scrapped after a few years of use. Copper pipes, on the other hand, are perfect for water supply: corrosion-resistant, scale-free inner walls, non-toxic, and even copper ions have a sterilizing effect. But using the metal for casting currency to make water pipes? The output from the North Slope Mine is not so luxurious, and even in later generations, copper water pipes are only considered for high-end residences.



At present, Border Town is not only unable to export minerals but also has to import metal ingots from outside. Therefore, whether it is iron or copper pipes, Roland is reluctant to use them to create a water supply system that cannot make a profit and is purely for enjoyment.



But now it's different. With Soraya's coating, it means he can produce water pipes using only magic—such as taking an iron pipe as a mold, wrapping it with paper, then letting Soraya cover it with her coating, and after pulling out the mold, the pipeline is formed. Even if such water pipes are not pressure-resistant, they can be placed in a covered pipe trench.



Next is the electrical supply system... This probably can't be popularized throughout the town in the short term, but to fill the castle with light has always been something Roland wants to achieve. Reading with the faint light of candles is too painful, and the damage to the eyes is enormous. Moreover, with summer approaching, what would it feel like to light torches and candles on a stuffy night?



Now with generators and wires, it seems not so far-fetched to bring the castle into the electrical age ahead of time. As for the filament of the light bulbs... he vaguely remembers, before tungsten wire was used, people commonly used carbonized bamboo filaments to make incandescent lamps. Bamboo is not a rare thing; there is plenty of it in the forests south of the Redwater River.



However, what Border Town currently needs most is iron smelting facilities. The production of iron is directly related to the scale of mechanical production and weapon manufacturing, and it is the foundation for the town's survival.



"Is this a tower you're drawing?" Nightingale sat at the edge of the table and asked curiously.

"More or less," Roland nodded, "but its interior is hollow, used for loading fuel and ore, functioning like a blast furnace, capable of smelting iron ore into pig iron."

This is the blast furnace—an upgraded version of the ancient shaft furnace.

He had observed the shaft furnace designed and built by Lucia at the construction site, and to be honest, aside from its smaller capacity and lower temperatures, its structure was already very close to that of a blast furnace. Had it not been for Soraya's evolution granting the town the ability to produce refractory bricks, he would have planned to build a dozen more shaft furnaces like that.

But with the refractory bricks available, it was natural to consider constructing a blast furnace with higher temperatures and greater production capacity.

The new blast furnace design was nearly eight meters high, four times the size of a shaft furnace; the body of the furnace was tower-shaped, with an internal diameter of three meters at its widest point, supported by a frame at the bottom to prevent collapse. The furnace walls were thinner at the top and thicker at the bottom, with the belly of the furnace reaching a half-meter in thickness, using the innermost layer of Soraya-brand coated refractory bricks, and also equipped with a row of air inlets, through which air was drawn into the belly of the furnace by a steam engine.

To fully utilize the power of the steam engine, Roland also designed an automatic feeding system for the blast furnace, including a climbing rail and a specially made feeding cart with a movable bottom door. When the cart was pulled to the top of the furnace by the steam engine, the latch at the bottom would be hooked and opened, allowing the fuel or ore to be poured into the furnace. For this era, this system was considered cutting-edge technology.

Unlike a shaft furnace with a large opening and low heat, once the blast furnace commenced production, it would operate continuously for a long period, requiring an uninterrupted supply of fuel and ore, and its output was much higher than that of a shaft furnace. With just five or six such blast furnaces, the town's pig iron production would increase exponentially.

...



After finishing all the drawings, Roland rubbed his somewhat sore wrist and moved a box out from under the table, pushing it in front of her.



Nightingale blinked in surprise, "What's this...?"



"Um... I was planning to give it to you earlier, but it took some time to engrave the patterns. After all, I'm not too proficient with the machines in the factory," Roland said with a smile, "Open it and have a look."



She reached out to open the box and couldn't help but gasp in admiration.



Inside, two revolving pistols were placed alternately—their design differed from the prototype gun used on the day of the contest with Carter. These pistols gleamed with a silver radiance, their surfaces so polished they could reflect a person's image, with exquisite patterns carved on the handles and the bodies of the guns. On the barrels, Nightingale's name was inscribed: 'To Veronica.'



This plan had been brewing in Roland's head for quite some time. Compared to the inconvenient, cumbersome muzzle-loading flintlock pistols, the newly developed revolvers were quite refined, maintaining high levels of safety and firing rates. For a witch like Nightingale, who had high mobility, the potential power of firearms in her hands was something to look forward to.



"Thank you," she said with a smile, picking up the two pistols and jumping off the table, striking a firing pose, "Will you teach me how to use them?"



"Of course," Roland nodded. Her pristine white assassin's outfit, combined with a dazzlingly bright smile, made him instantly understand what it meant to be so cool you have no friends. "It's not difficult. Just sneak up close to the target, pull the trigger, and shout 'The noon has arrived' as you do."
