## Military framework
In the days following the Victory Celebration, Roland threw himself back into the grand undertaking of farming. 



Seated in his office, the ticking sounds from outside the window were constant, as if it were raining. It was the sound of melting snow. When he spent the New Year in the countryside, he used to love lying by the window, watching the long icicles under the eaves turn into transparent droplets and fall bit by bit. Although he no longer had such leisurely moments, drafting plans while listening to the sounds of the earth awakening was quite nice too.



Based on past experience, the snow would take about a week to melt, but the road between the town and the stronghold would need at least a month to become passable. Roland could imagine what the muddy roads would be like without a hardened surface and drainage measures after the ice and snow melted. If he could successfully take over Longsong Stronghold, the first thing he would do would be to build a hardened road between the two places that could accommodate carriages.



However, what still needed priority was the issue of military construction. Without a reliable and strong army, it would be impossible to defeat the stronghold's forces when outnumbered. Transforming the militia into a regular army was only the first step; the specifics of organization, rules and regulations, and rewards and punishments were the real headache for him. 



Although he had played military chess as a child, he had long since forgotten it completely. After much contemplation, Roland simply decided to come up with his own. After all, he was the creator of the new type of army, and if the settings were unreasonable, no one would notice.



Thus, the first military structure of Border Town was quickly established: an army, division, battalion, company, and squad as the overall framework, with five people to a squad (considering that at least five people were needed to operate a cannon), ten squads to a company, and ten companies to a battalion. As for the number of people in a division and an army, he decided to consider that later. Given the overall level of warfare in this era, having two or three battalion-level units would be enough to rout most opponents in field battles.



With the basic framework set, Roland let out a long sigh of relief.



The following rules and regulations were much simpler. Aside from the old clichés like always obeying military orders, obeying superiors, not deserting in the face of battle, not betraying, etc., the first discipline Roland set was to prohibit looting and disturbing the civilians.



There were countless disadvantages to indulging subordinates in looting, and the negative impact on the local people would be difficult to remedy even after several years. This was also why he insisted on using civilians as the composition of the army's personnel.



When nobles responded to the call of their lord to campaign, it was a pipe dream to expect them not to partake in looting after defeating the enemy. In fact, a primary reason for their willingness to follow the lord into battle was the opportunity to wantonly plunder the wealth and lands of their adversaries—this, of course, included the innocent civilians living on those lands.



As for mercenaries and bandits, there was no need to even mention them. They appeared fierce and ferocious, but in truth, they could only fight when the wind was at their backs. Looting was also a major source of their income, and military discipline meant nothing to these people.



Only an army composed of civilians would not regard other civilians as sheep to be slaughtered. Of course, relying solely on discipline and harsh punishments was not enough; over time, the greed in their hearts would inevitably grow with each victory. Therefore, it was essential to implement a system of rewards to fundamentally eliminate looting and other acts of indiscipline.



To ensure the rewards were sufficiently motivating, Roland decided to unleash the ultimate weapon—military merits in exchange for land. Those who made significant contributions in battle would be granted land. Roland had already identified the source of this land: the undeveloped land between Border Town and the stronghold.



In an era where ninety percent of the land was owned by the nobility, this was definitely a generous prize. Once they had a steady property, these people would cling tightly to him, and anyone who tried to overthrow him would face the fiercest resistance from those who had benefited.



The way to drive the people was not through words and whips, but through tangible benefits. In other words, as long as one could always represent the fundamental interests of the people under one's rule, their position of power would be unshakable.



Unlike traditional fiefs, Roland controlled the size of the granted land to a few to a dozen acres, which could be used to build homes, purchase serfs, or hire farmers to manage the land, but not for establishing industries. In comparison, a knight's domain was close to two thousand acres, roughly the size of a small village. The income from the industries operated on such land could provide for the knight's and his retinue's needs in battle, such as purchasing weapons, armor, and horses.



Such small land grants would not provoke strong opposition from the noble interest groups and would weaken the independence of the land recipients. In Roland's view, this was akin to a pension for retirement, ensuring that soldiers would have a stable income even after they retired.



At the same time, to strengthen central authority and avoid situations where "the servant of my servant is not my servant," those granted land would only have ownership rights, not self-governance rights. In other words, this land would still be subject to the laws, decrees, and systems of the lord's domain. In a sense, they were more like the farm owners of later generations.



After transcribing these initial institutional ideas one by one, Roland stretched his body. Next, he could finally delve into the field he excelled in—developing weaponry.



As the production speed of the firearms increased, continuing to equip pikemen to protect the gunners would result in a waste of manpower; the latter must possess the ability to fight independently in close combat.



The solution was simple: affix a bayonet to the gun. Roland did not expect his troops to launch proactive bayonet charges against the enemy. It was only necessary for them to have the fighting capability when the enemy was driven to desperation, and the artillery had not completely destroyed their courage.



Bayonets were not difficult to manufacture. If one pursued simplicity, it would just be a sharp cone. The key was the connection between the bayonet and the gun: the earliest bayonets had a handle that wrapped around a thin wooden rod, which could be directly inserted into the barrel. The advantage was that it was simple to make, but the disadvantage was also very clear. One could not shoot during a bayonet fight, and after the battle, it was particularly hard to pull out.



The type Roland intended to produce was the improved second-generation bayonet—the socket bayonet. At the end of the handle, there was a bent section connected to a section of iron socket. The inner diameter of the socket was slightly larger than the barrel, with a zigzag notch. A small iron bar only needed to be welded onto the barrel for the notch to slot in and secure the blade. The blade itself was triangular in shape, with a cross-section similar to a "V," and all three sides were sharpened, allowing for easy withdrawal after stabbing and leaving a wound that was difficult to heal.



After installing the socket bayonet, it would be slightly higher than the barrel, somewhat affecting the ammunition loading, but compared to the folding bayonet, it had the advantage of being sufficiently simple and convenient for mass production. Once a sample was made, it could be left to the blacksmith shop to forge on their own.



To make the bayonet effective in actual combat, the key lay in training the soldiers on how to use it.



Roland was completely ignorant in this regard. Fortunately, he remembered that the Chief Knight had once boasted that he could handle any military weapon with proficiency, so Roland decided to simply find him to instruct the gunner team on how to fight with bayonets.
