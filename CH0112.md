## Battle of Eagle City (Part 2)
The Royal Knights were like a silver blade, slicing into the rear of Grace's troops.

The crowd immediately descended into chaos, with many people falling to the ground in their haste to flee, only to be trampled to death by the cavalry.

Occasionally, someone would draw their weapon to resist, but they would be skillfully impaled by the knights' lances. Leading this unstoppable tide at the very front was Coldwind Knight Naiman Moor, his trailing blue-striped cloak particularly eye-catching. Wherever he went, enemies scattered to avoid him. After a round of charging, his lance and longsword were both covered in blood.

Timothy Wimbledon stood on a small hill in the distance, observing the situation on the battlefield. At this moment, the tail of the three-thousand-man troop was no longer as neat as before, the crowd spreading out more and more, and the pace of their advance had almost come to a standstill.

They won't last much longer, Timothy thought. A couple more rounds of charges and his sister's troops will collapse. These people simply can't withstand the charge of Greycastle's elite knights. Most of them don't even have armor, and a single strike is enough to completely incapacitate them.

As he expected, after spending an extra hour detouring around Eagle City, crossing over a mountain hollow, and passing through a sparse forest, the Knights returned to the main road. Then he ordered the whole team to speed up and finally caught up with the main force of Grace's troops around noon.

Following the tactics taught by the Duke, Timothy divided the Knights into three groups of about three hundred each, taking turns to strike at the enemy's flanks and rear. This not only preserved the strength of their horses but also ensured that they had reserves that could be mobilized in case of emergency. To avoid being surrounded, the knights didn't need to kill their way into the mass of people; they just had to approach the troops from the side, speed up and charge, cutting off and consuming a small segment of the tail, causing dozens of casualties each time.

Such tactics were clearly effective. After several rounds, the enemy had suffered more than a hundred casualties without any power to fight back. They also tried to organize a cavalry counterattack, but the gap in equipment and training was too great. Compared to the Royal Knights, the hastily assembled cavalry were nothing more than foot soldiers on horseback. In a single encounter, those "cavalry" who had bravely entered the fray were slaughtered and scattered in retreat.

This one-sided slaughter dealt a huge blow to morale, and Timothy noticed that people in Grace's troops had already begun to break ranks and flee in different directions.



It's time to launch the final assault, he thought. When the Bitter Wind Cavalry returned under the lead of their knight commander, he did not order the next round of charges, but instead made his way back to the knights' encampment from the small hillside.



"Your Majesty, they are about to be dispersed," Naiman wiped the sweat from his forehead, the bloodstains in his palm leaving several marks on his face— all of it enemy blood. He had fought until now without a scratch.



Timothy handed his handkerchief to him, "Well done, rest for a moment, and we'll deliver the final blow to the enemy."



Seeing that the next round of cutting-off charges had not come, the troops of Grace realized that the decisive moment was about to arrive. The huge army stopped advancing entirely, slowly closing in on itself until they formed a tight group. Those on the outermost layer raised their wooden spears.



Timothy snorted at this, considering it nothing more than a dying struggle. Without chevaux-de-frise, without armor, hoping to stop the assault of the Royal Knight's Order with mere flesh and blood would only end in a tragic defeat. Whether his younger sister was still among their ranks or not, it wouldn't change the outcome. Perhaps she had already changed her clothes and left, leaving these people behind to buy time for herself.



But he soon realized he had thought wrong.



The banner of Queen Clearwater was raised again within the crowd, the green silk flag fluttering in the wind, its pattern of a sailboat and crown causing Timothy to frown. He lifted his telescope and peered into the enemy formation. He saw a blurred figure of a woman standing atop a "human platform" formed by several warriors, raising her hand high as if shouting something. He couldn't make out her face, but the flowing silver hair revealed her identity.



Grace Wimbledon, she actually hadn't fled.



Timothy took a deep breath, good, with this the farce would come to an early end here. He wouldn't need to take another trip to Clearwater Harbor after all.



After the horses were well-rested, the new king issued the order for the whole army to attack.

Over eight hundred cavalrymen, composed of knights and their retainers, led by the Royal Knightage, charged at the enemy. And the tip of the Knightage's spear was still the Coldwind Knight—Nomen Moore.

Just as the knights were about to break into the enemy's formation, a large group of riders suddenly appeared on the horizons to the east and west. They emitted strange cries as they madly rushed towards the center of the battlefield.

Timothy couldn't believe his eyes. Who were these people?

Without any banners or family crests, the suddenly emerged troops were unlike any force within the kingdom. Under the spyglass, most of them didn't even have armor, and their weapons were a miscellaneous assortment. However, their tall statures and strange faces only reminded Timothy of one type of people.

The Sand People from the extreme south!

He no longer needed to guess whether they were friend or foe. Without a doubt, Grace must have struck some deal with the detestable foreign race, allowing these Sand People to meddle in the power struggle of Greycastle. Filled with rage at this thought, Timothy turned and shouted loudly, "Sound the horn, call the knights back!"

But it was already too late. The army, in the midst of a high-speed charge, could not easily turn around. The Knightage plunged into Grace's ranks and, like a hot knife through butter, aimed straight for where Queen Clearwater was positioned.

Timothy eagerly looked toward the flag standing tall against the wind, hoping it would break—The Sand People attacking from both sides numbered around a thousand each, swelling Grace's army to five thousand men. This number was more than he could handle. Moreover, the Sand People were formidable in individual combat, posing a great threat to the Knightage in close-quarters battle. If he could kill the enemy leader at this time, cut down the flagpole, and break through Grace's militia, he still had a sliver of chance for victory.



However, the flagpole shook but still stood tall amidst the formation.

The Sand People completed the encirclement, joining the battle through the path opened by the Knights.

Without this reinforcement, the three thousand desperadoes under Grace would have already dispersed. But at this moment, they were still holding on, like a swamp, slowly dragging the knights into their midst.

The retreat horn resounded across the battlefield, and knights who had broken through gradually rallied towards Timothy. However, many were still trapped within the enemy's formation, including the Gale Knight.

He was entangled with a foreign warrior who stood nine feet tall, already gasping for air. The opponent's giant wooden stick created a small clearing around them, as Naiman's mount had been smashed to death. Relying on his exceptional reflexes and agile movements, he dodged left and right, but his thick armor rapidly drained what little strength he had left. Finally, during an attempt to dodge to the side, he lost his footing and was struck squarely in the chest by the sweeping wooden club. The force was so great that it caved the armor into his body, breaking the club in two.

The blue cloak slowly fell, disappearing into the crowd.

Half an hour later, the number of knights still fighting dwindled, and when the Sand People turned their gaze towards Timothy's position, he gritted his teeth and issued the order to retreat. The party began to withdraw to the north. In contrast to the vast host they had arrived with, only three hundred remained by the new king's side.
