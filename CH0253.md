## Hot Air Balloon Trade
"Your Highness, I've been wanting to ask you since I came in," Hogg finally caught his breath, having drained a jug of ice water from the barrel, "The painting in the hall... It's not something an ordinary person could draw, right? Whether it's the lifelike quality or the perspective of looking down on the earth from the sky." He paused and lowered his voice, "Is this... the work of a witch?"



Roland looked toward Margaret, who nodded, "Please rest assured, Your Highness. Hogg is an old friend of mine whom I've known for many years, and he bears no malice toward witches."



"You guessed right, it is indeed drawn by a witch." Roland, after taking a hot air balloon ride near the beach two days ago, wanted to preserve the grandeur of the scene. Moreover, the castle's reception hall was sparsely decorated, not even a single painting adorned the walls, so he simply asked Soraya to turn the stone wall behind the main seat into a massive mural. With the artistic backdrop, the hall's ambiance was instantly elevated several notches.



"I knew it," Hogg sighed, "Although they are portrayed as minions of the devil, those unique abilities are truly enviable. Ordinary people can’t fly into the sky like them, let alone paint such an exquisitely unparalleled mural."



"You only got the first half right," Roland shook his head, "Ordinary people can fly without relying on magic power, even higher than eagles and faster than swifts."



"You're quite humorous, Your Highness," Hogg laughed heartily, "Unless we grow an extra pair of wings and become lighter than birds."



Margaret was actually taken aback, "Really?"



"Of course," the prince smiled, "I can prove it to you."



Showing the merchant his various inventions was an effective way to enhance relationships and expand trade routes—from coffee cups to liquor, the same principle applied, regardless of whether they sold well or not. After all, the merchant caravan would stay in town for a few days, and the standard procedure for trade negotiations should indeed involve eating, drinking, and having fun before signing the deal. Besides, Anna was also very interested in traveling by hot air balloon, which would be a good opportunity for her to take a break from her busy work, a win-win situation.



The Seagull quickly completed its inflation, and this time for the voyage, Roland simply invited the witches who had not been able to ride the hot air balloon the last time. Lucia timidly asked if she could take her sister up to have a look, and he agreed without hesitation.



As the balloon carrying everyone gently rose, Margaret covered her mouth in surprise, while Hogg tightly grasped the edge of the basket, not knowing if he was excited or afraid. Bell was too short to see the scenery outside the basket, so Lucia had to lift her up, placing her on her own shoulders, cautiously approaching the edge of the basket, and instructing her not to move around. Lightning, serving as the navigator and rescuer, kept circling around the hot air balloon, occasionally making faces at Bell.



In this way, the hot air balloon took another tour along the southern coastline, completing the aerial sightseeing trip.



...



Back at the castle, Hogg's legs were still trembling as he stuttered, "I never thought that looking down from the sky could be so terrifying. I felt like I could fall at any moment."



"You'll get used to it after a few more flights," Roland said with a smile, "Everyone who leaves the ground for the first time will have that illusion, just like people who have never been to sea will vomit all over the place on a rocking ship."



"You're absolutely right," Margaret exclaimed, "The scenery I saw today was incredible. Looking towards the edge of the sea from the air, it seemed like a brilliant blue arc."



"But Your Highness, I guess I'm not wrong either," Hogg said after taking a sip of chilled white liquor, "Ordinary people indeed flew to the sky, but it's still thanks to the witches. If it weren't for them, this big guy probably wouldn't have been able to fly."



"No, my old friend," Roland had yet to speak when Margaret quickly interjected, "Haven't you noticed? Miss Anna was only releasing flames. I specifically asked Lightning, and she told me that as long as hot air is filled into the balloon, the Seagull can rise into the sky on its own. Flames are not the exclusive domain of witches, Your Highness, am I right?"



Being a merchant that has established a firm foothold in the capital, your observational and thinking skills are indeed exceptional," Roland nodded with a smile. "Hot air rises, cold air sinks, which is also why it's called a hot air balloon."



"Is it really just a matter of lighting a brazier?" Hogg asked doubtfully.



"That won't do, because to keep it floating in the air, you must continually heat it. Wood itself is very heavy, and you can't carry too much of it, so we must use a special method to solve this problem."



"Can you do it?" Margaret asked eagerly.



"Uh... It should be possible," Roland pondered for a moment, "but it's a bit of a hassle."



"That's great," she immediately replied, "I hope to purchase four or five hot air balloons from you. They don't need to be too big, just enough to carry one person."



"Do you intend to use them on ships?" Hogg asked.



"Yes, the mast can't be extended indefinitely, but a hot air balloon can. As long as you tie a rope under the basket to keep it from drifting with the wind, that's enough. With a hot air balloon, the lookout can spot nearby pirate ships earlier. For a sea merchant, aside from the unpredictable storms and tsunamis, the greatest threat comes from groups of pirates."



"But its cost will probably not be low," Roland calculated in his mind, "I estimate it will require over a thousand Gold Royals."



Without the aid of witches to heat it, the hot air balloon would have to use gaseous fuel, and the most readily available would undoubtedly be coal gas. Unfortunately, the coal mines of Greycastle are located in Coldwind Ridge, far too distant from Border Town, and with the current transportation conditions, it is almost impossible to transport it here. Switching to hydrogen balloons would be easier to achieve, but that too requires solving the problem of storage tanks—if they cannot be filled and emptied at will, they have no practical value.



"How about one thousand gold royals for each balloon?" Margaret bargained, "If you really make such a thing, I guarantee that all caravans traveling through the Fjords will want to buy one or two."



"This time, the Crescent Moon Bay caravan didn't come with us, otherwise they would definitely place a big order," Hogg downed his white liquor in one go, "I don't need it, though. Although hot air balloons seem very magical, they are of no use to the mines of Silver City. I just hope to get my steam engine as soon as possible."



The price offered by the other party was beyond Roland's expectations. One thousand gold royals was a premium he had marked up fivefold in his price estimate, yet to his surprise, the other party readily accepted a price twice that of the steam engine. However, upon further thought, it made sense— the cargo carried by a single sea ship could very likely exceed this price, not to mention an entire merchant fleet and the accompanying sailors. As long as they could avoid pirate plundering, this deal was still profitable for the seafarers.



Moreover, one thousand gold royals was not a one-time deal. Whether hydrogen or coal gas, both were consumables that would eventually need to be refilled in town, bringing in additional income... Of course, if a large number of gas tanks were purchased at once, it would be worth considering a discount or offering free refills. On this point, the 4S stores and PetroChina were his role models for learning and imitation.



Roland feigned hesitation for a moment and finally nodded, "Then it's a deal."
