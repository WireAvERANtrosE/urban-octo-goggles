## Hot Air Balloon Trade
"Your Highness, I've been wanting to ask you since I entered," Hogg showed a relieved expression as he finished off a jug of ice water from the barrel, "the painting in the hall... it's probably not something that just anyone can draw, right? Whether it's the degree of realism or the perspective of looking down at the earth from the sky." He paused and lowered his voice, "Is this... the work of a witch?"



Roland looked towards Margie, who nodded, "Please rest assured, Your Highness, Hogg is an old friend of mine for many years, and he bears no malice towards witches either."



"You guessed right, it is indeed drawn by a witch." Roland had taken a ride in a hot air balloon near the beach two days ago and wanted to keep that magnificent scene, and since the castle's reception hall was simply decorated with not even a single painting, he simply let Soraya transform the stone wall behind the main seat into a huge mural. With the artistic backdrop, the hall's tone was instantly elevated several notches.



"I knew it," Hogg sighed, "Even though they are proclaimed to be the minions of the devil, those bizarre abilities are truly enviable. Ordinary people can't fly into the sky like they do and then create such a beautiful and exquisite mural."



"You're only half right," Roland shook his head, "Ordinary people can fly without relying on magic, and even fly higher than eagles and faster than swifts."



"You're quite the humorist," laughed Hogg, "Unless we grow an extra pair of wings and become lighter than birds."



Margie, however, was taken aback, "Really?"



"Of course," the prince smiled, "I can prove it to you."



Showing the merchant his various inventions was also an effective way to enhance relationships and expand trade routes—everything from mugs to spirits was the same; whether they could be sold or not was another matter. Anyway, the caravan would stay in the town for several days, and the standard procedure for business negotiations should indeed be to eat, drink, and have fun before signing the documents. Moreover, Anna was also very interested in traveling by hot air balloon, which would be a good opportunity for her to take a break from her busy work, truly killing several birds with one stone.



The Seagazer quickly completed inflation, and this time for the voyage, Roland simply invited the witches who had not been able to ride the hot air balloon last time. Lucia timidly asked if she could take her sister up to see the view, and he agreed without hesitation.



As the balloon carrying everyone slowly ascended, Margaret covered her mouth in surprise, while Hogg gripped the edge of the basket tightly, not sure if he was excited or scared. Bell, being too short to see over the edge of the basket, had to be lifted by Lucia, who perched her on her own shoulder, carefully approached the edge, and instructed her not to move about. Lightning, serving as the navigator and rescuer, circled around the hot air balloon, occasionally making faces at Bell.



In this manner, the hot air balloon took another leisurely circle along the southern coastline, completing the aerial sightseeing tour.

...

Back at the castle, Hogg's legs were still trembling as he stuttered, "I never thought that looking down from the sky would be so terrifying. I felt like I could fall at any moment."



"You'll get used to it after a few more flights," Roland said with a smile. "Everyone has this illusion the first time their feet leave the ground, just like someone who has never been to sea will get seasick on a rocking ship."



"You're absolutely right," Margaret exclaimed. "The view I saw today was incredible. Looking towards the edge of the ocean from the sky, it appeared like a blue arc."



"But Your Highness, I don't think I was wrong either," Hogg said, taking a sip of iced white wine. "Ordinary people did indeed fly into the sky, but it was still the witches' doing. Without them, this big fellow probably wouldn't be able to fly."



"No, my old friend," Roland hadn't spoken when Margaret interjected, "Haven't you noticed? Miss Anna was merely releasing flames. I specifically asked Lightning, and she told me that as long as you pump hot air into the balloon, the Seagazer could rise into the sky on its own. Flames are not the exclusive right of witches, Your Highness, am I right?"



"As expected of a bay merchant who has secured a foothold in the capital, your observational and thinking abilities are outstanding," Roland said with a smile, nodding. "Hot air rises, cold air sinks, and that's why it's called a hot air balloon."



"Is it really just a matter of lighting a brazier?" Hogg asked doubtfully.



"That alone won't suffice because in order to keep it aloft, you need to continually heat it. Wood itself is quite heavy and you can't carry much of it, so you must solve this problem with a special method."



"Can you do it?" Margaret asked eagerly.



"Um... I should be able to," Roland pondered for a moment, "though it is somewhat troublesome."



"That's wonderful," she immediately replied, "I hope to purchase four or five hot air balloons from you. They don't need to be too large, just enough to carry one person will do."



"Do you want to use them on ships?" Hogg asked.



"Yes, masts cannot be extended indefinitely, but hot air balloons can be. All you need to do is tie a rope under the basket to prevent it from drifting away with the wind. With hot air balloons, lookouts can spot nearby pirate ships earlier. For a sea merchant, aside from unpredictable storms and tsunamis, the biggest threat comes from bands of pirates."



"But the cost of it will probably not be low," Roland estimated in his mind, "I expect it will require over a thousand Gold royals."



Without the aid of witches for heating, the hot air balloon would have to use gas fuel, and the most readily available source would undoubtedly be coal gas. Regrettably, Greycastle's coal mines are located in the Coldwind Ridge area, far too remote from Border Town. Given the current transportation conditions, it's almost impossible to transport it here. Switching to hydrogen balloons would be easier to implement, but it also requires solving the issue of gas storage tanks—without the ability to fill and release at will, they would be of no practical use.

"How about 1,000 gold royals per balloon?" Margaret bargained, "If you really make such a thing, I can guarantee that all the caravans traveling to and from the Fjords would want to buy one or two."

"The Crescent Moon Bay caravan didn't come this time, otherwise they would definitely place a large order," Hogg drained the white liquor in his hand, "I’ll pass, though. While the hot air balloon seems quite magical, it is of no use to the mines in Silver City. I just hope to get my steam engine as soon as possible."

The price offered by the other party took Roland by surprise; 1,000 gold royals was an overcharge after he had raised his estimated price by fivefold, yet the other party was willing to accept a price twice that of a steam engine. However, upon further thought, it made sense: the goods carried by a single sea vessel could very well exceed this price, not to mention an entire merchant fleet and accompanying sailors. As long as they could avoid pirate plundering, this deal would still be profitable for the sea merchants.

Moreover, 1,000 gold royals was not a one-time deal. Whether it was hydrogen or coal gas, both were consumables that would eventually need to be refilled in town, which would be an additional source of income... Of course, if one were to purchase a large number of gas tanks at once, it would be worth considering a discount or offering free refills. On this point, the 4S stores and the two oil giants were his role models for learning and imitation.

Roland feigned hesitation for a moment before finally nodding, "Then it's a deal."
