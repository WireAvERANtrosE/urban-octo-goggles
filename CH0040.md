## Family Letter
The pile of firewood was burning brightly, but Herman Wimbledon didn't feel much of the heat. Although this was a large tent stitched together from cowhide, with its base tightly sealed with earth, there should not be any place for the wind to get in, yet he still felt icy cold, particularly his toes, which were almost numb from the cold. "This damned place, even peeing would freeze you," he spat, stood up, grasped the sides of the table with both hands, exerted force, the veins on his hands bulging out, and the solid wooden square table six feet wide was lifted off the ground. 

Only after moving the table closer to the fire pit did Herman feel much more comfortable. He took off his shoes, placed his feet on the fire to warm them, unrolled a piece of paper in his hand, and continued to write the unfinished letter. 

"To my dear Livia," 

"I have been in Hermes for over a month now. Of course, those guys in the church prefer to call it the New Holy City. If it weren't for the Evil Months Pact, I wouldn't want to stay here for a moment, and I just want to return to your cabin and share the warmth of the bed with you." 

"Thanks to the Pact, the army that was supposed to monitor the church's every move has become their ally, isn't that ironic? Speaking of the church, I have to admit, what they've done is indeed astonishing. I remember when I first came here twenty years ago, Hermes had nothing but mountains and rocks. The towns established by the church were all at the foot of the mountains. But now, they have not only opened up a road for carriages to go up the mountain, they have also established a large fortress city on the top of the mountain." 

"If it were summer, you should really come and see with me, their so-called New Holy City is even more majestic than Greycastle. Do you remember the theater in the capital of Greycastle? We went there to watch "The Prince's Revenge," and you marveled at how cleverly designed the theater was, and how spacious it was inside." 

"But if you see the arena in the New Holy City, you will find that the Greycastle theater is nothing at all. To call it a building, I think it's more like an exquisite work of art. It's the size of five theaters, yet not a single stone pillar supports it. Eight things like giant beast bones protrude from the outer wall, and between the curved beast bones are many branches and hemp ropes, suspending the entire roof in the air, like a crane. How did they come up with that?"

"And those bones, if they were peeled from the beast, I bet that creature was definitely over a hundred feet. Probably only in Hermes could such a monster be found. But my dear, there's no need to worry. Even if the beast is massive, it's just a minion of the hell devil. In front of the Divine Stone of Judgement, no evil can escape God's punishment, whether it's the beast, the witches, or the devil himself. Their fate is only to be reduced to ashes."
Writing this, Herman Wimbledon put down his pen and shook his somewhat numb hand. It was strange, he could swing a fifteen-pound double-handed sword for an entire day, but felt tired after writing just a few words with a pen. He chuckled at himself, I'm indeed more suited for rough work.
"Speaking of beasts, I suddenly remembered that my fourth younger brother was assigned to such a poor place as Border Town. He must have already fled into Longsong Stronghold with his tail between his legs - even though the beasts there can't compare to those on the Hermes defensive line. I don't blame him, even I would have to seek refuge if I were in such a place. This shows how unfair my father is, just because my second brother has always been exceptionally smart, he decided to let him inherit the throne? Father has forgotten that he didn't win the throne of Greycastle by being smart. Ever since mother passed away, it's become increasingly difficult for me to understand his thoughts."
The following content made Herman hesitate, he didn't know if he should tell Livia his real plans. After a brief pause, he decided to write it down. If the plan goes smoothly, by the time this letter is delivered, he should have already reached the Greycastle Palace.
"My dear, Scholar Ang is right. If I do nothing, the throne will definitely not belong to me in the end. He has observed this from the stars. "The Apocalypse Star is moving away from the sun, and within four months it will completely leave the sun's orbit." The scholar told me this. Obviously, there isn't much time left, I can't just wait idly anymore."
"After today's battle, I will quietly return to the royal capital with my loyal soldiers. Coldwind Ridge may not be as rich as Golden City, but it's not short of brave warriors. Just throw out some coins and promises, they will pounce on my target like starving wolves. Of course, I don't want to do that. I just want to personally ask my father why he issued such a childish decree for the king's contest, what made him forget that I am the one with the first right of inheritance."
"Scholar Ang has arranged everything for me. Livia, my love, wait a little longer. The day I become king will be the day I marry you as my queen. If I unfortunately fail... don't return to the royal capital, live well in Coldwind Ridge."
"Yours, Herman."
He carefully folded the letter, placed it in an envelope, and sealed it with wax. After checking several times, he knocked on the table, and a personal soldier quickly entered the tent from outside.

"Deliver this letter to Rose of Border Town. You need not travel day and night, nor ride a horse. Dress as an ordinary traveler and take the commercial caravan between the two places. There's one thing you must remember, this letter must be personally delivered."
"Yes, Prince!"
"Good, off you go." After dismissing his personal guard, Herman simply sat on the table, his feet dangling over the fire pit.
In doing so, he left himself with no way out.
He closed his eyes, reminiscing about his childhood. Back then, he used to play hide and seek with his younger brother and sister in the royal garden. When his little sister fell, both of them insisted on falling with her. When did they start growing apart and became strangers like they were now?
Herman shook his head, casting away his messy thoughts. Sentimentality didn't suit him. He thought that all these confusions would eventually have an answer - after he ascended to the throne.
At that moment, a dull horn sounded from outside the tent.
"Oooooooooooooooooooooo-"
It's here! He jumped off the table, put on his shoes, and stepped out of the tent. The whole camp had already sprung into action. Running soldiers and flags formed streams, converging on the predetermined battlefield. The echo from the distant mountains was muffled and continuous.

The horn sounded long, and the demonic beasts attacked. 
"Follow me!" He mounted the warhorse that his personal guards had brought, and jogged towards the top of the city wall. 
Only by standing on the wall of the Holy City could one feel its grandeur—it was like an insurmountable natural moat, standing at the mouth of the Desolate Mountain Range. The top was flat and wide, allowing dozens of people to walk side by side. In front of it was a cliff made up of glaciers, and behind it was a flat plateau. 
This was why the church desperately wanted to build the New Holy City on top of the mountain. 
Using this terrain, they built a defense line that was almost impossible to break through. 
But Herman · Wimbledon had to look further ahead. The ability to transport so much stone and wood from the foot of the mountain to the top, and to build a city on Hermes in just twenty years was a testament to the church's staggering strength. 
However, no matter how much he despised these religious fanatics, Herman had to admit that if they did not support them in holding Hermes, all countries on the continent would face a catastrophe. This was also the basis for the signing of the Evil Months Covenant. 
During the arrival of the Evil Months, the four kingdoms bordering Hermes must send troops to assist the church and fight alongside the Judgement Army of the church. 
Four flags stood against the wind on the city wall, the "Dawn" with the serpent staff, the "Wolfheart" with crossed sword and shield, and the "Everwinter" with the iceberg rose—

And the "Greycastle" of the high tower and long spear.

Looking at the black dot appearing in the distant sky, Herman·Wimbledon tightened his grip on the greatsword.
