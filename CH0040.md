## Family Letter
The firewood pile blazed fiercely, but Herman Wimbledon could hardly feel any warmth.



Though this was already a large tent stitched together from cowhide with the bottom ring pressed tightly with soil, supposedly leaving no place for the wind to leak through, he still felt a chill throughout his body, especially in his toes, which were nearly numb from the cold.



"This damned place, even your pee freezes," he spat, stood up, and with his hands clenching both sides of the table, he lifted forcefully. Veins bulged on the back of his hands as he raised the six-foot square solid wood table off the ground.



Only after placing the table next to the fire pit did Herman start to feel much more comfortable. He took off his shoes and placed his feet on the fire to warm them up, spreading out a piece of parchment in his hands to continue writing the unfinished letter.



"To my dear Olivia,"



"I have been in Hermes for over a month now. Of course, the church folks prefer to call this place the New Holy City. If it weren't for the Evil Months Pact, I would not want to stay here for a moment longer, just wishing to return to your cabin and share the warmth of our bed."



"Thanks to the Pact, the army tasked with monitoring the church's every move has become their supportive ally. It's quite ironic, isn't it? Speaking of the church, I must admit, what they have done is truly astonishing. I remember the first time I came here twenty years ago, Hermes had nothing but mountains and stones. The towns built by the church were all at the foot of the mountains. But now, not only have they carved out roads for carriages to ascend the mountain, but they've also constructed a massive stronghold city at the summit."



"If it were summer, you really should come see with me what they call the New Holy City, which is even more majestic than King's City. Do you remember the theater in the capital of Greycastle? I went there with you to watch 'The Prince's Revenge,' and you marveled at how ingeniously the theater was designed, how spacious it was inside."



"But if you saw the parade ground of the New Holy City, you would realize that the theater there is nothing in comparison. To call it a building, I find it more akin to an exquisite work of art. A space as large as five theaters, yet without a single stone pillar for support. The outer walls extend out eight bone-like structures resembling the bones of a giant beast, with many branches and ropes connecting between the curved bones, suspending the entire roof in the air like a truss. How did they come up with that?"



"Moreover, those bones, if they were stripped from the demonic beasts, I bet that creature must have been over a hundred feet long. You'd probably only encounter such a monster in Hermes. But my dear, please don't worry. No matter how huge a demonic beast is, it's nothing but a minion of the devils of hell. Before the God's Punishment Stones, no evil can escape the sanction of the divine, be it demonic beasts, witches, or the devils themselves—all will be reduced to ashes."



At this point, Herman Wimbledon put down his pen, shaking his somewhat numb hand. Strangely, he could swing a fifteen-pound two-handed sword all day without tiring, yet his hand felt weary after writing just this much. He laughed self-deprecatingly, "I really am more suited for the work of a rough man."



"Speaking of demonic beasts, it suddenly occurs to me—my fourth brother was assigned to a poor place like Border Town; I'm afraid he's already fled with his tail between his legs into the Longsong Stronghold—although the demonic beasts there can hardly compare to those on the Hermes front. It's not his fault, though. Even I would have nothing to do in such a place but seek refuge. This shows just how unfair my father is. Just because my second brother has been particularly clever since childhood, he decided to let him inherit the throne? Father has forgotten that he did not win the throne of Greycastle with cleverness. Since mother's death, it has become increasingly difficult for me to fathom his thoughts."



Herman hesitated over what he was about to write next. He was unsure if he should disclose his true intentions to Olivia, but after a brief pause, he decided to continue writing. If all went according to plan, by the time this letter arrived, he should have already reached the palace in Greycastle.



"My dear, Scholar Aon was right—if I do nothing, the throne will never be mine. He has observed this from the stars. 'The Star of Revelation is moving away from the Blazing Sun, and in no more than four months, it will completely leave the orbit of the Blazing Sun.' The scholar told me this. Clearly, there’s not much time left, I can no longer wait idly."



"After today's great battle, I will quietly return to the capital, with my loyal warriors. Windham may not be as wealthy as the city of Valencia, but what it does not lack is brave warriors. With just some coins and promises thrown their way, they will pounce on my target like hungry wolves. Of course, I do not wish to do so. I just want to personally ask my father why he issued such a childish royal decree, and what made him forget that I am the one with the primary right of succession."



"Scholar Aon has arranged everything for me, Olivia, my love, wait just a bit longer. The day I become king will be the day I take you as my queen. Should I be unfortunate and fail... then do not return to the capital, live well in Windham."



"Yours, Herman."



He carefully folded the letter and placed it in an envelope, then sealed it with wax. After checking several times, he knocked on the table, and a personal guard quickly entered the tent.



"Take this letter, and deliver it into the hands of Rose in Coldwind Ridge. There is no need for you to travel day and night, nor to ride a horse. Just dress like an ordinary traveler and take a merchant caravan that goes back and forth between the two places. There's only one thing you must remember: this letter must be delivered into her hands personally."

"Yes, Your Highness, the Prince!"

"Very well, off you go." After sending away the guard with a wave, Herman simply sat on the desk, dangling both feet above the brazier.

By doing this, he had left himself with no way out.

He closed his eyes, recalling scenes from his childhood. Back then, he would play hide and seek in the royal garden with his younger brother and sister, and when his sister fell, both he and his brother insisted on falling themselves before calling it even. When exactly did the three of them start to become strangers to each other as they were now?

Herman shook his head to dispel the chaotic thoughts. Being sentimental was not suitable for him, he thought. These confusions would eventually have an answer—after he ascended the throne.

Just then, a dull horn sound came from outside the tent.

"Woo woo woo woo woo woo woo woo woo woo woo woo woo woo woo woo woo—" 

They're here! He leapt down from the desk, put on his shoes, and exited the tent. The entire camp had already sprung into action. Soldiers running and flags fluttering merged into torrents, converging towards the predetermined battlefield. The murky echoes from the distant mountains continued without end.



The horn sounded long and persistent, demonic beasts were approaching.



"Follow me!" He mounted the warhorse brought by his personal guards and trotted towards the top of the city wall.



Only by standing atop the Holy City's walls could one truly appreciate their grandeur—they stood like an insurmountable rift in the sky, erect at the break in the Impassable Mountain Range. The top was flat and wide enough to accommodate dozens of people walking side by side. In front was the cliff made of glaciers, and behind was the flat plateau.



This was why the Church was so desperate to build the new Holy City on the mountain summit.



By utilizing the difference in terrain, they had constructed a line of defense that was nearly impossible to breach.



And Herman Wimbledon had to look even further ahead. The fact that the Church could transport so much stone and lumber from the base to the summit of the mountain and build a city on Hermes within a mere twenty years was already astonishing.



But no matter how much he detested those priests, Herman had to admit that if they did not support them in holding Hermes, all the kingdoms on the continent would face a catastrophe. This was also the foundation upon which the Covenant of the Evil Months was signed.



During the Evil Months, the four great kingdoms bordering Hermes must send troops to support the Church, fighting alongside the Church's Judgement Army.



Atop the city, four flags fluttered in the wind: the "Dawn," with its serpent-bodied scepter, the "Wolfheart," with crossed swords and shields, and the "Everwinter," with its ice-laden rose—



And the Longsong Stronghold's "Greycastle."

Gazing at the dark spots appearing in the distant sky, Herman Wimbledon clenched his greatsword.
