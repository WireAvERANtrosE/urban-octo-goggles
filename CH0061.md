## Return
As Roland squatted on the ground to install the base, three figures suddenly materialized out of thin air and stumbled to the ground as they landed.



Anna was startled and jumped, a cluster of green flames flaring up into a wall of fire, blocking in front of them.



Roland looked up and saw that one of the women was Nightingale, whom he hadn't seen for many days. She looked very disheveled, her cheeks showing an abnormal flush of red. Despite the cold wind outside, her forehead was covered with dense beads of sweat.



"Your Highness, please call for Nana, quickly!" she raised her head and shouted, her anxiety evident in her voice.



Roland had already noticed the woman Nightingale was carrying on her back. Her face was deathly pale, her eyes tightly closed. Half of her arm was missing, and the cloth wrapped around the stump was soaked with blood and had turned dark red.



"Cardan, go to the hospital and bring Nana here!" he called out urgently towards the door.



"Yes, Your Highness!"



Besides these two, there was also a little girl tucked under Nightingale's arm. She seemed to be alright, her eyes curiously looking around.



"You're not hurt, are you?" Roland stepped forward to untie the cloth strap from Nightingale's back and took down the woman with the broken arm.

"I'm fine, Your Highness, cough cough... I'm sorry, I wasn't able to bring back the sisters from the Witch Cooperation Association," Nightingale gasped, her voice weak and powerless, clearly having endured a long journey and being nearly exhausted.

"Don't say anything, just rest well first." Roland lifted the severely wounded woman who was unconscious and then had Anna assist Nightingale, as the five of them returned to the castle together. Nightingale's room was next to Anna's. He commanded the maid to light the stove and prepare a large bucket of hot water in the room. After Nana arrived, he briefly explained the matters of cleaning the wounds before treatment and then left the room first.

As long as she wasn't dead, Nana would be able to heal her wounds as before, and preserving her life wouldn't be too difficult. Nightingale had even brought back the woman's severed arm, but the arm had lost blood for a long time, and he didn't know if it could still be reattached. The subsequent cleaning and treatment required undressing, and as a member of the new generation raised under the Red Flag, Roland consciously chose to avoid it.

But how did things turn out like this? He wondered. Could it be that the Witch Cooperation Association's camp was attacked by demonic beasts, resulting in only three people escaping? If that were the case, it would be a tremendous loss.

He paced restlessly outside the door, and after about half an hour, the door was pushed open. The first to come out was the little girl who had returned with Nightingale, looking unharmed. She nodded to Roland, "You're exactly as Nightingale described."

"..." Roland was momentarily taken aback, "What did she say about me?"

"A prince who cares for witches," she said gently as she closed the door. "Unfortunately, the news was too shocking, so most people in the Witch Cooperation Association didn't believe her. Actually, I didn't really believe it either, but as my dad says, the world is so big, there are all kinds of people. My name is Lightning, Your Highness, I'm pleased to meet you." She bowed her head, with her right hand chopping onto her left shoulder—probably a form of salutation.

But Roland's mind wasn't on that. He keenly picked up on the phrase "most people didn't believe her." "The Witch Cooperation Association's camp wasn't attacked by demonic beasts?"



"Attack? No... Why would you ask that?" She tapped her forehead with her index finger, then revealed an expression of sudden realization, "Ah, I understand now. The big sister with the broken arm is called Wendy, she was injured by the Witch Union's mentor Cara." Following that, Lightning briefly recounted the events.



After listening, Roland fell silent. So that's how it was... he thought, he had truly underestimated the cruel oppression that witches faced in this world. Accumulated over years, the witches' distrust towards the Church and the nobility had reached a peak. And Cara was among the most radical of them. From Lightning's description, it seemed that the leader of the Witch Union would probably want to eliminate people like himself as soon as she had enough power.



But fortunately, Nightingale had returned safely in the end.



Not only that, but she had also brought back two witches to Border Town. As for the model community project, Roland thought it over and decided to let Karl continue with the construction. Even if it wasn't needed now, there would eventually be more witches.



"Are you also a member of the Witch Union?"



"Not anymore," she spread her hands, "just like Wendy and Nightingale, once we left, it was impossible to go back. Cara probably wants to devour us alive now."



"She survived being pierced through by Nightingale?" Roland asked with a frown.



"Probably. There's a witch in the camp named Leaf who can increase the potency of herbs several times," Lightning pondered, "Using more hemostatic grass and blood coagulants, saving Cara's life shouldn't be too difficult, but compared to your witch, the effect is much worse."



That's indeed a problem, he thought, not worried about being targeted by the Church, but it would be ironic to end up being targeted by the witches. Fortunately, their main goal was to find the Holy Mountain, so they should not have the time to trouble Nightingale for now.



"You said before that you didn't completely believe Nightingale's words, so why did you escape the Witch Cooperation Association with her?"



"Because of the black machine that puffs out white steam, the powder that turns into stone gray when it gets wet, and the snowflakes that can burst out with thunderous booms!" Lightning repeated the words she had said to Nightingale, "There might not be a prince who treats witches well, but she wouldn't have lied to me about these things, or else she couldn't have made them up so vividly—this is the intuition of an explorer. Right, the big thing I saw in the courtyard earlier, was that the black machine that spews out white steam? Nightingale seemed to say it was called... a steam engine?"



"Explorer?" Roland automatically ignored the last question.



"Yes, an explorer." She emphasized each word, "This is why I chose to follow Nightingale to this place. An explorer is filled with curiosity about all the unknown."



"..." Roland sighed silently to himself. Was this some sort of adolescent fantasy? To pursue something beyond mere survival in this era, one must come from a wealthy family. Looking at her tomboyish outfit and that head of shiny golden short hair, "Are you really not called Israel?"



"Who's that? My name is Lightning." The little girl declared proudly.



Just then, Anna and Nana also pushed the door open and walked out.



"How did it go," Roland asked, "was the treatment successful?"



Seeing Nana nod, he finally breathed a sigh of relief. Generally speaking, a severed limb needs to be reattached within six to eight hours. Beyond this time limit, the success rate of the surgery drops significantly. And since Lightning said it took them nearly a day to get from the camp here, the ends of the limbs would have already started to wither, making it almost impossible to reattach the nerves with conventional surgery. It could only be said that Nana's healing ability was truly miraculous.



The little girl also seemed somewhat exhausted, as if this treatment had taken a great deal of her energy. Roland encouraged her with a few words, "You've worked hard. After dinner tonight, you can go to sleep with Anna."



Of course, he thought, they would also need to bring over Titus Pine.
