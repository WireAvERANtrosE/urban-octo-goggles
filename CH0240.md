## Awarding Ceremony
Roland was designing the medal pattern for tomorrow's knighting ceremony. In theory, this task, which wasn't particularly important, should have already been completed, but he had been somewhat restless since the afternoon.

To be exact, ever since Nightingale had kissed him.

Although he had vaguely sensed it before, the other party had not made it clear, and it wasn't appropriate for him to broach the subject proactively. Now that there was no doubt, how should he respond to her feelings?

Nightingale's actions made him realize that he didn't dislike her at all, and was even somewhat pleased with himself. Who could resist liking a beautiful, composed woman who spent day and night with him? Roland's inability to respond openly was due to the ingrained notions formed over more than twenty years, the real-life issues he would face in the future, and... Anna's thoughts. Especially the last point—he couldn't ignore Anna and act solely on his own preferences.

Perhaps these answers could only be left to time.

Suddenly, there was a knock on the door.

"Come in, it's unlocked," Roland called out, somewhat surprised. Who would come to the office at this time?

Entering was Anna, with one hand holding two plates of food and the other carrying a clay pot. Before she even spoke, Roland had already smelled the tempting aroma.

"Food?"



"Mhm," Anna said with a smile as she placed the plate on the table, then removed the bowl covering the clay pot and poured out the milky soup. "This is called Honey Roasted Mushrooms. One dish was made by me, and the other by Nightingale. The soup in the pot is Mushroom Soup, flavored with some common aromatic herbs."



"It looks delicious," Roland licked his lips. "You should sit down and eat with us."



Anna nodded and sat down at the opposite side of the table.



"Where is Nightingale? Why didn't she come?"



"She said... she didn't know what kind of face to make when she sees you," she replied. "I don't quite understand why she cares about that."



"..." So that's how it is, Roland sighed softly in his heart. Although he spoke confidently with no sign of regret, claiming, 'It's not your fault, I only did what I wanted to do,' in reality, he was hardly braver than a squirrel poking its head out of a hole. Really, is this being bold or being timid... "Well, let's start eating then."



Picking up a slice of mushroom and putting it into his mouth, the sweetness of the honey instantly melted on his tongue, followed by the juice contained within the mushrooms. In an era without MSG, this rich and fresh sensation was astonishing... and a bit of salt only enhanced its freshness, with the final touch being the chewy texture of the mushrooms themselves, delicate and resilient, the flavor was simply impeccable.



"These... are not ordinary mushrooms?" Roland swallowed and immediately noticed something distinctive about them. Ordinary mushrooms, if still smooth and crisp after grilling, were already quite good, but how could they be juicy on their own? They weren't cooked in soup.



"Mhm, it's a specialty of the Hidden Forest. The people in town call them Bird Beak Mushrooms," Anna explained with a smile as she told the story of the mushrooms' origin. "That's why I wanted you to try them."



Roland tasted another mushroom used for making soup, equally delicious and even richer in juices. It felt like eating a soup dumpling, and there was an added crispness to the chewing. This long-missed taste reminded him of a very common seasoning, suitable for any dish, from the modern world—monosodium glutamate (MSG). Before the discovery of sodium glutamate, chefs could only indirectly enhance the umami flavor of dishes, for instance, by simmering high-quality stock from whole chickens, bones, mushrooms, and soybeans. Although modern cooks prefer to showcase their skills through the natural flavors of the ingredients, it's undeniable that even the most inexperienced beginner can elevate the taste of food by several notches with the addition of MSG.



If the Bird Beak Mushroom was naturally plump and juicy, it would be an ideal source for extracting MSG. Growing on trees and hard to pick, is that why it hasn't been popularized? None of these were problems for Roland.



"How many of these mushrooms are there?"



"I'm not sure... but there should be quite a few," Anna took a small bite, "Maggie said she only flew around the edge of the forest and brought back a big bag for me."



"That really is good news," Roland neatly finished off the mushroom slices that Anna had cooked and reached for another plate, "I was just worrying about getting sick of pork chops, whether seasoned with pepper or smeared with honey—pfft."



"What's wrong?"



"Nothing... it's nothing." Tears nearly came to his eyes. Oh my, this piece is really salty. Did Nightingale accidentally drop it into a jar of salt? Although he thought this, he still swallowed the mushroom. Afterwards, Roland found that the rest of the mushroom slices were either burnt or undercooked, some charred on one side and half-raw on the other. Fortunately, the Bird Beak Mushrooms were delicious in themselves, which greatly masked her poor culinary skills.



"I... I'm full," he put down his chopsticks, finally finishing the second plate and then drinking up the soup, his stomach was already bloated. "Thank you."



"Mhm, and Nightingale," Anna's smile was adorable, and Roland couldn't help but pinch her nose. She let out a sound and leaned in to kiss the prince's cheek, "Then I'll go wash the dishes, remember to go to bed early."



After the witch left, Roland breathed a sigh of relief.

Although he was reluctant to ignore Anna's thoughts... some things were not so easy to say. He thought helplessly that this probably had something to do with his identity as a mechanical engineer, given that throughout his academic career, he had rarely interacted with the opposite sex. Even after graduating and successfully joining a large-scale design institute with a considerable salary, this point had still not changed.

Fortunately, there was still a long way to go before completely defeating the Church, so he could take his time to think about what to do next. For now, it was best to concentrate on finishing the work at hand.

...

The next morning, when Roland stepped onto the temporary wooden platform in the square, it was already surrounded by a sea of people.

The present Border Town had undergone a dramatic transformation from its previous desolate and impoverished state; to say it was completely renewed would not be an exaggeration.

The sparse, old houses in town had all been demolished, replaced by construction sites and uniform brick houses springing up everywhere, all built according to a community master plan, looking neat and orderly—even though they only occupied one-third of the town's land, they were enough to accommodate the original two thousand inhabitants.

With the construction of three and four-story residences, as well as the subsequent development of the community, the same piece of land would house an ever-growing population. As it stood, the name Border Town no longer seemed to fit the reality, as no small town could boast a population of nearly twenty thousand and a professional army of six hundred soldiers. He planned to officially elevate this place to a true city by next spring.

Under the effect of the Echo's ability, Roland's voice quickly quieted the crowd.



"Today is the first award ceremony in Border Town, intended to commend and inspire those who have made significant contributions to this place. Nearly half a year has passed since I arrived here. We have defeated the demonic beasts, overcome the Duke, and built the town into what it is today. Many people have given a lot for this, among them are a few outstanding individuals. They were not nobles, nor were they rich merchants; before serving me, they were just ordinary people, just like you all!"



He looked around and said loudly, "But now, they will receive a rich reward! This includes a medal that I crafted by hand, one hundred Gold royals, and five acres of land!"



This news caused a stir among the crowd. Leaving aside the medal and the land, just those one hundred Gold royals were an enviable fortune.



"Such a ceremony will not be a one-time event—henceforth, an award ceremony will be held every year. Regardless of birth, regardless of wealth, as long as one's achievements are outstanding, they can receive this highest honor!"



As Roland's voice fell, the sound of the echo-simulated salute cannons immediately filled the venue. Amid the continuous booming, Iron Axe, Kyle Sichi, and Nana Pine, escorted by the First Army, stepped onto the wooden platform.
