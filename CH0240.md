## Knighting Ceremony
Roland was designing the medal pattern for the award ceremony tomorrow. Logically speaking, this task, which wasn't particularly important, should have been finished long ago, but he had been somewhat restless since the afternoon.



To be exact, it was since Nightingale kissed him.



Although he had a vague premonition before, since the other party hadn't made it clear, he didn't feel it was right to bring it up proactively. But now that there was no doubt, how should he respond to Nightingale's feelings?



Nightingale's actions also made him realize that he didn't dislike Nightingale—in fact, he was somewhat pleased with himself. Who could resist a beautiful, composed woman who spent day and night in his company? Roland couldn't respond directly due to the conventions that had formed over more than twenty years, the practical issues he would face in the future, and... Anna's thoughts. Especially the last point; he couldn't ignore Anna and just act according to his own preferences.



Perhaps only time could provide the answers to these questions.



Suddenly, there was a knock on the door.



"Come in, it's unlocked," Roland called out, somewhat surprised. Who would come to the office at this hour?



The person who entered was Anna, holding two dishes on one hand and a clay pot in the other. Before she could speak, Roland had already caught the enticing aroma.



"Is this food?"



"Mm," Anna smiled as she placed the plate in front of the table, then took off the bowl covering the clay pot and poured out the milky soup, "This is called honey-roasted mushrooms, one dish is made by me, and the other by Nightingale, while the pot contains mushroom soup, seasoned with some common herbs."



"It looks delicious," Roland licked his lips, "You should sit down and eat with us too."



Anna nodded and sat down opposite the table.



"Where is Nightingale? Why didn't she come?" 



"She said... she doesn't know what kind of face to make when she sees you," she answered, "I don't quite understand why she cares about this."



"..." So that's how it is, Roland sighed softly in his heart. Although he spoke with confidence, without any hint of regret, and even brazenly said, "This is not your fault, I just did what I wanted to do," in reality, he was no braver than a squirrel peeking out from its hole. Really, was this being bold or timid... "Well, let's eat first then."



Picking up a piece of mushroom and putting it in his mouth, the sweetness of honey instantly melted in his mouth, followed by the juice contained within the mushroom. In an era without MSG, this rich and fresh taste was enough to amaze... and a few grains of salt further enhanced its freshness, with the mushroom's own chewy texture, delicate and resilient, the taste was simply impeccable.



"These... aren't ordinary mushrooms?" Roland swallowed and immediately noticed something special about them; ordinary mushrooms would do well to remain smooth and crisp after grilling, how could they contain juice? It's not like they were boiled in soup.



"Mm, it's a specialty of the Misty Forest, the townspeople call it bird's beak mushroom," Anna explained with a smile, "That's why I wanted you to try it too."



Roland tried another mushroom used for soup, equally delicious and even juicier, feeling like eating a soup dumpling, with an added crunchiness when chewed. The long-lost taste reminded him of a very common seasoning in the modern world, suitable for any dish—monosodium glutamate, or MSG. Before the discovery of sodium glutamate, chefs could only indirectly enhance the umami of their dishes, for instance, by simmering broth with whole chickens, bones, mushrooms, and soybeans. Although modern cooks preferred to showcase their culinary skills through natural flavors, it was undeniable that even the most inexperienced novices could enrich the taste of food by several notches simply by adding MSG.



If the Bird Beak Mushrooms were naturally juicy and succulent, they would be the ideal raw material for extracting MSG. Growing on trees and hard to pick, was that why they weren't widely used? None of this was a problem for Roland.



"How many of these mushrooms are there?"



"I'm not sure… but there should be quite a few," Anna nibbled a piece, "Maggie said she only flew around the edge of the forest and brought back a big bag for me."



"That really is good news," Roland neatly finished off the slices of mushrooms Anna had roasted and reached for another plate, "I was getting tired of having my pork chops with either pepper or honey—pfft."



"What's wrong?"



"Nothing… it's nothing." His eyes were brimming with tears, oh my, this piece was incredibly salty, did Nightingale accidentally drop it into the salt jar? Even so, he swallowed the mushroom. Afterwards, Roland found the rest of the mushroom slices were either burnt or undercooked, with one side charred and the other half raw. Luckily, the Bird Beak Mushrooms were delicious in their own right, which largely compensated for her poor cooking skills.



"I… I'm full," he put down his chopsticks, having struggled to finish the second plate and then drinking up the soup, his stomach was bloated. "Thank you."



"Mhm, and Nightingale," Anna's smile was adorable, and Roland couldn't help but pinch her nose. She let out a sound and leaned in to kiss the prince's cheek, "Now I'll go wash the dishes, remember to go to bed early."



After the witch left, Roland let out a sigh of relief.

Although he was reluctant to ignore Anna's thoughts... some things were not so easy to express. He thought helplessly that this might also be related to his identity as a mechanical engineer, as he had barely interacted with the opposite sex during his entire academic period. Even after graduating and entering a large design institute with a considerable salary, this had not changed.

Fortunately, there was still a long way to go before completely defeating the Church, and he could take his time to consider what to do next. As for now, it was better to concentrate on finishing the work at hand.

...

The next morning, when Roland stepped onto the temporary wooden platform in the square, the area was already crowded with people.

Border Town had undergone an earth-shaking transformation compared to its previous desolate and impoverished state; it was not an exaggeration to say it was completely renewed.

The sparse old houses in the town had all been demolished, replaced by construction sites and uniformly styled brick houses being built everywhere, all according to the overall planning of the community; although they only occupied one-third of the town's land, they were enough to accommodate the original two thousand inhabitants.

Once the three-story and four-story residences were under construction, along with the development of subsequent communities, the same piece of land would accommodate an ever-increasing population. As it stood, the name Border Town clearly no longer fit the actual situation, as no town could boast a population of nearly twenty thousand and a professional army of six hundred soldiers. He planned to officially elevate this place to a real city by next spring.

With the power of Echo's ability, Roland's voice quickly quieted the crowd.



"Today, is the first award ceremony in Border Town, meant to commend and inspire those who have made significant contributions to this place. Nearly half a year has passed since I arrived here; we have defeated the demonic beasts, beaten the duke, and built the town into what it is today. Many people have given much for this, among them are outstanding individuals who were not nobles, nor rich merchants. Before serving me, they were just ordinary people, just like you all!"



He looked around and said loudly, "But now, they will receive a rich reward! This includes a medal forged by my own hands, one hundred Gold royals, and five acres of land!"



The news stirred up a wave among the crowd; even setting aside the medals and land, the one hundred Gold royals alone were an enviable fortune.



"Such a ceremony will not be just this once—hereafter, an award ceremony will be held every year. Regardless of birth, regardless of wealth, as long as the achievements are outstanding, one can receive this highest honor!"



As Roland's voice fell, the sound of the salute cannons echoed throughout the venue. Amidst the continuous booming, Iron Axe, Carter Lannis, and Nana Pine, escorted by the First Army, stepped onto the wooden platform.
