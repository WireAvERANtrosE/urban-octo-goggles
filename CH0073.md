## Cannon Test-Fire
Border Town, Western Territory, by the Redwater River.



The snow made it difficult for the carriage to move an inch, and it took half a day for a group of people to drag the first well-made field artillery piece to the outskirts of the town.



"What is it this time?" Carter had become somewhat accustomed to the prince's constant stream of new toys, "A giant musket?"



"Pretty much." Roland directed his subordinates to remove the hooks, then personally adjusted the angle of the gun carriage, leveling the barrel and bracing the support poles into the snowy ground.



The principle of the cannon was exactly the same as that of the musket, so calling it an enlarged version of the musket was quite apt. This cannon fired twelve-pound solid iron balls, with the projectile and gunpowder both loaded from the front and ignited by a fuse. Roland, drawing on historical designs that had been proven to work, had carpenters create a wooden gun carriage. To enhance durability, parts that would rub against the ground more and bear more force during firing were reinforced with iron sheeting.



Creating the gun carriage and wheels took almost as much time as boring the barrel. Three carpenters were busy for a week to complete the task, especially for the pair of wheels that were taller than half a person. The carpenters first planed four equal lengths of square timber, soaked them and then bent them with heat, carving notches at the ends to fit together, with the outer rim of the hub wrapped and struck with iron sheeting. This entire process took four days.



Therefore, in Roland's eyes, this completely handcrafted, limited edition twelve-pound field artillery shone with dazzling brilliance. When he took it out for a test fire, he arranged a substantial entourage — Chief Knight Carter and the commander of the militia, Iron Axe, need not be mentioned, but the personal guards and knight apprentices were all mobilized, and the militia also dispatched twenty men to clear the area and keep watch. In addition, he had brought along Nightingale and Lightning for the first time. Thanks to Nana's blessing, the militia's prejudice against witches had been reduced to the lowest level, and Nana herself had become the most reputable person in the team after the prince.



"Let's follow the procedure, starting with cleaning the barrel," Roland said. Although he was very clear about the structure of the cannon, he was completely blank on the specific operations. He racked his brains to recall various scenes of cannon operation in medieval movies, trying to sort out a process. As for how effective it would be, heaven only knew.



Lightning, full of enthusiasm, pulled out a mop-like cleaning rod from underneath the gun carriage and shoved it into the muzzle—unlike other witches, Lightning had proposed that as long as she could personally operate all kinds of novel inventions, she would be willing to serve Roland without requiring any salary. Faced with such a cost-saving condition, Roland naturally agreed immediately, since he could always secretly research any confidential projects when needed. He had many more ideas and inventions waiting to be realized; just taking out a few would keep her busy for quite some time.



After fiddling for a bit, the mop didn't bring out any debris, but according to the procedure, she still had to perform a second cleaning. Switching to another mop, she pumped it a few times again, and the cannon cleaning was considered complete.



"Did you all see clearly?" Roland asked the knights and militiamen gathered around. This test firing was also a drill, as the production of firearms had increased significantly. The militia was bound to evolve into regular infantry, and wooden guns would be replaced by firearms and cannons. This required a lot of shooting training to be able to operate these two types of weapons proficiently on the battlefield.



Seeing everyone nodding, he then let Lightning carry out the next step.



The little girl took out a bag of gunpowder wrapped in paper, stuffed it into the cannon bore, and used a wooden rod to poke it all the way down. Then she inserted the cannonball and poked it in tight again. Taking out the drill rod, she inserted it into the touch hole at the rear end of the barrel, pierced the powder bag, and then inserted the fuse. With this, the firing preparation was complete.



To prevent accidents, everyone withdrew thirty steps away and took cover behind a barricade. Lightning brought the torch close to the fuse, and saw the sparks at the end flash, instantly entering into the barrel.



Then came a thunderous boom—



The high-speed airflow from the muzzle lifted the accumulated snow, raising a mist of snow from the ground. The twelve-pound cannon's theoretical effective range could reach over a kilometer, and even without rifling, the trajectory of the cannonball in the initial stage was as straight as a line. The armor target placed about a hundred meters away emitted a clang as it was hit head-on by the twelve-pound iron ball, which sent it flying. The momentum of the iron ball did not diminish as it fell on the snowy ground, bouncing continuously and stirring up columns of snowflakes.



When the smoke cleared, Carter and Iron Axe were the first to run to the target. The front of the armor had completely caved in, with the front plate sticking to the back plate, and a palm-sized hole was located in the center of the armor. Clearly, the cannonball had continued to fly about a hundred meters after piercing the target. Even as it rolled on the ground, it contained an amazing amount of force.



"What terrifying penetrating power!" Carter exclaimed, already imagining the dreadful scene when the enemy troops were clustered together and pierced through by several cannonballs.



"By the Three Gods." Iron Axe began to somewhat believe that Roland was the messenger of the Mother Earth, for who else could wield the power of flame to such an extent? Those grains of gunpowder, which he had studied over and over, would just be a common flammable material once ground into powder and lit. The flame was the raging fury of Mother Earth and also her most powerful weapon—thinking of the eternal orange fire spewing from the earth's bowels in the extreme south, he felt an impulse to prostrate in worship to the prince.



Roland, however, was not surprised by this result. The twelve-pound field gun was indeed a classic, especially the Napoleon cannon that had shone brilliantly in the American Civil War, fully demonstrating the truth that larger caliber is beauty.



Next, he used different amounts of propellant to test the strength of the barrel, knowing that it might lead to the destruction of the cannon, but it was a necessary test.



When the charge was increased to three bags, the cannon's muzzle began to rise upon firing, and the carriage shifted, yet the barrel showed no significant deformation. It seemed that the steel cast barrel was exceptionally strong. Roland eventually set the standard charge at 1.2 times the experimental charge, and what remained was to select the gunners and practice repeatedly.



"Your Highness, this weapon is indeed powerful, but it is too heavy. If it encounters a mud pit, it will be immobilized," Carter immediately pointed out the new weapon's drawback, "Moreover, after each round of firing, the barrel needs to be cleaned, and the gun reloaded with propellant and ammunition. Given that both the gunpowder and the shells are much heavier than those used for muskets, I'm afraid that just one cannon will require five to six men to operate."



"Indeed, but it is all worth it. With just two or three cannons equipped, the Duke... no, I mean the demonic beasts, the kind like the giant tortoises, will no longer be able to break through the city walls," Roland coughed twice, thinking to himself that was a close call. As for the drawback of the twelve-pound cannon being too heavy, he planned to solve that through shipping. To transform a steam engine into a steamboat, even the most primitive paddle steamer, was a complex and enormous mechanical system.



Rather than modifying it himself, it would be better to directly purchase a two-masted sailing ship. Relying on Wendy's ability to control the wind, they could quickly transport the militia and cannons to the rear of the Duke's forces, forming a pincer attack with the front troops to encircle and annihilate the living forces of the stronghold Duke.
