## Redwater River Bridge
A week later, Roland officially launched the steel bridge construction project.

"You mean to tell me, you want me to raise two pieces of land in the middle of the river to serve as the bridge's foundation?" Lily looked at the rolling river water and asked in surprise, "Are you planning to build a real bridge instead of using a pontoon bridge to connect both ends of the riverbank?"

"Yes," Roland spread out the scroll in his hands, "Considering the impact of the river water, the two pieces of land need to have a certain volume, and to reduce the impact force, they need to be shaped like this."

"This is... the shape of a boat." Lily shifted her gaze back to the drawing.

"Exactly, to be precise, a spindle shape," he nodded, "As long as it's parallel to the direction of the water flow, its front will receive the minimum impact force. The problem is, the Redwater River is nearly ten meters deep, can you raise the riverbed?"

"That is not difficult to achieve, Your Highness," Lily answered succinctly, "Leave it to me."

To be on the safe side, the ship responsible for transporting the witches was the 'Little Town,' its broad concrete hull moving effortlessly through the river, with Lightning still at the helm, while Wendy provided the wind sail power.

However, in the past week, the latter would slightly avert her gaze when seeing the prince, appearing somewhat uneasy. It was not until today that Roland saw her lift her head, looking at him as usual, and as she boarded the ship, passing by him, he heard a soft "Thank you" from her.

"You have to credit me for this," Nightingale whispered with a low chuckle in the mist around him.



The Seawind quickly left the dock and sailed towards the center of the broad river. Carter had already pulled up hemp ropes on both sides of the river, with two red ribbons tied to them marking the planned positions for the bridge piers. When the cement ship reached the first point, Lotus stood at the edge of the ship and began to use her powers.



Suddenly, the river's surface seemed to boil, churning upwards to form a "mountain bag." Soon, broken stones, grass roots, and silt emerged from the turbulent water, causing it to become increasingly muddy.



So that's how it is, Roland thought. Her ability could not only transform solid ground but also included water, and it was easier to lift water than to raise loose gravel. Although the raised water immediately rolled away to the sides, the riverbed had risen bit by bit.



Before long, a clump of bluish-gray mud surfaced, looking very soft and emitting an unpleasant odor, making everyone instinctively cover their noses.



However, in Roland's eyes, this was all prime fertilizer. For hundreds of years, the bones of fish and other aquatic creatures, water plants, and the excrement of residents had been slowly accumulating in the mud. If it weren't inconvenient to transport, he would have liked to use this soil to fertilize fields. Unfortunately, it could only be shoveled away by hand and thrown directly into the river.



In this way, they cleaned one layer and raised another section until they finally saw the firm, yellow-brown soil. The next step was to repeat this process until both pieces of land were fully shaped.



Roland estimated that this process would take at least a week, but simply raising the land above the water did not mean it was ready for use. The flowing river would continuously carry away silt, and without protection, even spindle-shaped land would not last more than a decade or two.



He called over Karl Barton and took out a charcoal pencil, drawing and explaining how the ground should be solidified in the next step.



"So, you mean to dig grooves along the edges of these lands and then fill them with cement?" the current Minister of Construction asked, gesturing at the drawings.



Not bad for an outstanding member of the Royal Masonry Association, Roland thought contently. He had only given a few simple reminders and the man had immediately grasped his intentions.



"That's right, each section should not exceed five meters in length, and the depth should be controlled at around one meter. After filling it with concrete, have the witch lower this groove by one meter. Repeat this process and it will form a concrete wall that goes straight down into the riverbed." This plan was conceived by Roland after seeing Lotus's ability. Since she could make the ground descend straight down, she should be able to bring any structure built on the surface down with it.



"Your idea is really ingenious," Karl's eyes lit up, "In this way, even if the river water washes away the outer soil, it will be stopped by the tightly wrapped wall."



Roland nodded, "The key is to control the overall depth of the sinking. Too little and the base won't be properly sealed, too much will waste concrete and delay the project. You will be responsible for this."



"Yes, Your Highness," he replied, "Taking into account the silt and soft soil that needs to be dug out, I estimate the total depth should be around twelve meters."



"Additionally, after surrounding the area with the concrete walls, do not cover the middle land with concrete. I want to plant flowers and grass on it in the future," the Prince instructed.



"Plant... flowers?" Karl was taken aback.



After all, these walls couldn't be completely watertight, and if they were constructed in segments, there would inevitably be uniform gaps in the wall. The simplest way to further stabilize the soil was to plant grass—vegetation can balance soil moisture and reduce erosion, especially the weeds with super long root systems that have been magically modified, which can ensure that the soil is firmly bound together.



After briefly explaining the role of plants in soil conservation, Roland turned to look towards the busy workers by the riverbank, "How is the construction of the drawbridge part going now?"



"The cement gravel pavement is being laid," Karl reported without a second thought, "It should be finished this week."

According to the plan, the bridges on both sides of the river were to be constructed of rubble and cement, just like the walls of the Western Region. As long as the positioning and measuring work was done well, there was no difficulty in construction itself. The bridge's ramp was raised a whole seven meters relative to the ground, connecting to the city streets through a long, gentle slope with a curve, and with the height difference between the riverbank and the water surface, when the iron bridge was completed, it should have a clearance of ten to twelve meters above the Redwater River, which was basically sufficient for the sails of inland ships.



Only one span of the main bridge had been completed so far, being tested on the shore—since the span was not large and the load was extremely low, Roland, even though he knew nothing about bridge engineering, was not at all worried about its reliability. In an era without overloading eight-wheelers, a thirty-centimeter-high I-beam was a solid guarantee, which could not possibly be crushed even if it was packed with people. Moreover, from processing to assembly welding, everything was handled by Anna, making the probability of a shoddy construction project extremely low.



Similarly, its installation was very simple. Once all three spans of the main bridge were prefabricated, they would be lightened by Hummingbird, then lifted into place by Lightning.



When this steel bridge, which allowed two four-wheeled carriages to pass side by side, stood over the Redwater River, the north and south banks would truly be connected as one.



"Even the greatest stonemason would find it hard to imagine such a magnificent bridge," Karl exclaimed, looking at the sparkling expanse of the wide lake, "Your Highness, does this steel bridge have a name?"



Roland thought for a moment, "Let's call it the Redwater Bridge."
