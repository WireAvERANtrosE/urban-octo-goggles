## Redwater River Bridge
A week later, Roland formally initiated the construction project for the steel bridge.



"You mean to say, you want me to raise two pieces of land in the middle of the river to serve as the foundation for the bridge piers?" Lily looked toward the rolling river water, asking in surprise, "Do you actually intend to build a real bridge, rather than using a pontoon to connect both ends of the riverbank?"



"Exactly," Roland spread out the scroll in his hand, "Considering the impact of the river water, the two pieces of land need to have a certain volume, and to reduce the impact force, they need to be shaped like this."



"This is... the shape of a ship." Lily shifted her gaze back to the drawing.



"That's right, to be precise, it's spindle-shaped," he nodded, "As long as it's parallel to the direction of the water flow, its front will receive the least impact. The problem is, the Redwater River is nearly ten meters deep, can you make the riverbed rise?"



"That's not difficult to accomplish, Your Highness," Lily answered crisply, "Leave it to me."



For safety's sake, the ship responsible for transporting the witches was the "Littletown," its broad concrete hull moving through the river as if on flat ground, with Lightning still at the helm, while the wind power was provided by Wendy.



However, in the past week, the latter would slightly shift her gaze away when she saw the prince, appearing somewhat uneasy. It wasn't until today that Roland finally saw her raise her head, looking straight at him as usual, and as they brushed past each other while boarding, he heard a soft "thank you" from her.



"You have to credit me for this achievement," Nightingale's voice chuckled softly in his ear amidst the mist.



The "Littletown" quickly left the dock, heading toward the middle of the wide river. Carter had already pulled hemp rope across both banks of the river, with two red cloth strips tied to it indicating the planned positions for the bridge piers. When the cement ship reached the first point, Lily stood at the edge of the ship's side and began to exert her ability.



Suddenly, the surface of the river began to churn as if boiling, surging upwards and forming a "hill." Soon, broken rocks, grass roots, and mud emerged from the tumultuous waters, and the water gradually became turbid.



So that's how it is, thought Roland. Her ability could not only transform solid ground, but it also encompassed water, and raising the water level was easier than lifting loose gravel. Although the raised water immediately fell back to the sides, the riverbed was rising bit by bit.



Before long, a mass of bluish-gray mud surfaced, looking very soft and emitting an unpleasant stench, causing everyone to cover their noses involuntarily.



However, in Roland's eyes, this was all excellent fertilizer. Over hundreds of years, the bones of fish and other aquatic creatures, aquatic plants, and the excrement of residents had accumulated little by little in the mud. If it weren't so inconvenient to transport, he would have liked to use this soil for fertilizing fields. Unfortunately, it could only be shoveled away by hand and directly thrown back into the river.



In this manner, clearing a layer and raising a section at a time, he finally saw the yellow-brown solid soil. The next step was to keep repeating this process until both pieces of land were completely shaped.



Roland estimated that this process would take at least a week or so, but simply raising the land above the surface did not mean it could be used directly. The flowing river would continuously carry away the sediment, and without protection, even spindle-shaped land would not last more than a decade or so.



He called Karl Van Bate over and, taking out a charcoal pencil, began to draw and explain how the ground should be solidified next.



"Your meaning is, to dig grooves around the edges of these lands and then pour in cement?" asked the current Minister of Construction, gesturing at the drawing.



The outstanding member of the King's City Stonemason Association really lives up to their reputation, Roland thought with satisfaction. With just a few simple reminders, he immediately grasped my intentions.



"That's right, each segment should not exceed five meters in length, and the depth should be controlled at about one meter. After filling it with cement, have a witch lower this groove by one meter. Repeat this process, and a cement wall that goes straight down to the riverbed will be formed." This plan was conceived by Roland after witnessing Lotus's ability. Since she can make the ground sink directly, she should also be able to bring any structures built on the surface down with it.



"Your idea is truly ingenious," Karl's eyes lit up, "In this way, even if the river washes away the soil on the outside, it will be stopped by the tightly wrapped wall."



Roland nodded, "The key is to control the overall height of the sinking. If it's too little, the bottom won't be sealed tightly. If it's too much, it would waste cement and delay the project. You will be responsible for this."



"Yes, Your Highness," he replied, "Taking into account the silt and soft soil that has been dug out, I estimate the total height should be around twelve meters."



"Additionally, after surrounding the area with cement walls, don't cover the land in the middle with cement. I want to plant flowers and grass on it later," the prince instructed.



"Plant... flowers?" Karl was momentarily stunned.



After all, these walls couldn't be made completely watertight, and uniform gaps would inevitably remain if the construction was done in segments. The simplest way to further solidify the soil was to plant grass—vegetation could balance soil moisture and reduce soil erosion. Especially weeds with exceptionally long roots that had been modified by Leaf could ensure that the soil was firmly bound together.



After briefly explaining the role of plants in soil conservation, Roland turned to look at the workers busy along the riverbank, "How is the construction of the bridge part coming along now?"



"The cement gravel pavement is being laid," Karl reported without hesitation, "It should be completed this week."

According to the plan, the abutment bridges on both sides of the river were made of rubble and cement, just like the city walls of the Western Region. As long as the positioning and measuring work were done well, there was no difficulty in construction itself. The bridge's ramp was raised a full seven meters above the ground level, connected to the city streets by a long, gently curved slope. In addition to the difference in height between the riverbank and the water's surface, when the iron bridge was completed, it should have a clearance of ten to twelve meters above the Redwater River, which was basically sufficient for inland river sails.



The main bridge had only one span completed at present, which was being tested on the shore—since the span was not large and the load was extremely low, Roland, even with no knowledge of bridge engineering, was not at all worried about its reliability. In an era without overloaded eight-wheelers, thirty-centimeter-high I-beams were a stable guarantee; even crowded with people, it was impossible to break the steel beams. Moreover, the processing and assembly welding were all handled by Anna, so the probability of shoddy construction was very low.



Similarly, its installation was also very simple. Once all three spans of the main bridge were prefabricated, they could be lightened by Hummingbird and then lifted into place by Lightning.



Only when this steel bridge, which allowed two four-wheeled carriages to pass side by side, stood over the Redwater River, could the two banks truly be connected as one.



"Even the greatest stonemason would find it hard to imagine such a magnificent bridge," Karl exclaimed, looking at the shimmering expanse of the lake, "Your Highness, does this steel bridge have a name?"



Roland thought for a moment, "Let's call it the Redwater Bridge."
