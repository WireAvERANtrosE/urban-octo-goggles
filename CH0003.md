## Witch Anna (Part 2)
Roland swallowed the last piece of fried egg and wiped his mouth with a napkin. "After all that, you're worried that the Witch Cooperation Association will hear she's not dead and come to rescue her?"

"Exactly, Your Highness," Barov stamped his foot. "They must be acting in haste, probably on the road. Had the witch died, it would have been all well and good, but now she's alive! Those lunatics even steal babies; I fear they won't let go of a fallen comrade."

Roland was a bit puzzled; he always felt something was amiss. Why did the Minister's Assistant and the Chief Knight seem to dread the witches as if facing a formidable enemy?

The woman who was to be hanged was a witch, wasn't she? She looked so frail that a gust of wind might knock her over. If she possessed such terrifying powers, why would she stand there to be slaughtered? No, she wouldn't have been captured at all; according to the Church, she was an incarnation of the devil. Except for the Judgement Army, any mortal force would pay a heavy price in front of a witch. Yet this devil was captured by the residents of Border Town, tortured in every way, until she was sent to the gallows, and her terrifying power was nowhere to be seen.

"How was she captured?"

"It is said that during the collapse in the Northern Slope Mine, she revealed her identity in an attempt to save her own life and was caught by the angry villagers."

Roland thought for a moment; yes, he remembered this incident. It happened the day before he transmigrated.

"How did she reveal herself?"

"This... I'm not too sure," the Minister's Assistant shook his head. "The situation was very chaotic at the time. Someone must have seen her use witchcraft."

Roland frowned. "You didn't investigate this matter thoroughly?"

"Your Highness, resuming production in the mine area is the priority," the Minister's Assistant protested. "Half of Border Town's fiscal revenue depends on this iron ore, and the prosecutor confirmed that there were people who died from witchcraft at the scene."

"What kind of witchcraft?" Roland's interest was piqued.

"It was as if melted, their heads and most of their bodies spread flat on the ground, reminiscent of a burnt-out black candle," the other party said with disgust. "Your Highness, you wouldn't want to see such a scene."

Roland toyed with the silver fork in his hand, deep in thought. In history, most of the victims of witch hunts were innocent. They were used as tools for venting by the Church and the ignorant populace, while a small portion were simply asking for trouble. These individuals dressed in odd fashions, constantly throwing all sorts of strange ingredients into pots, claiming they could predict the future and determine life and death.

And indeed, they figured out some tricks, such as using flame tests to claim they had obtained the power of the gods.

To modern people, these were mere chemical parlor tricks, but at the time, they could easily be misconstrued as incomprehensible phenomena.

As for melting people, Roland's first thought was chromic acid cleaning solution, but it was troublesome to prepare and required the body to be completely immersed. The effect on dissolving bodies was also far inferior to a candle, and other strong acids were even less suitable.

So how did this witch accomplish this?

If she relied on alchemy, then she would be a rare chemist in the territory. If not...

At this thought, Roland made up his mind.

"Take me to see her."

"Wait... wait a moment, Your Highness, you want to see a witch?" Barov stood up anxiously, knocking over the cup of milk he hadn't drunk.

"Yes, that is an order." Roland turned back and smiled at the minister's assistant. He was now somewhat thankful for the fourth prince's unreasonable style.

As he walked to the door, he suddenly paused, "By the way, I've been meaning to ask, why hanging?"

"What?"

"Why hanging? Aren't witches supposed to be burned at the stake?"

Barov looked utterly baffled, "Is that so? But she isn't afraid of fire."

...

Border Town had only one dungeon; the barren land could not sustain many prisoners, and most criminals faced trial after just a few days—either to be released or executed.

Besides Barov, those who followed the prince into the dungeon included the Chief Knight, the Warden, the jailer, and two guards.

The dungeon had four levels, with walls made of solid granite. This was Roland's first time in such a place, and he noticed that the further down they went, the narrower the corridors became, and the fewer the number of cells. It was probably like digging a big inverted cone pit and then stacking it up with stones, he thought.

Such rough construction naturally lacked proper drainage, leaving the floors damp and filthy water flowing, seeping down the stairs step by step.

The witch was locked in the bottom layer of the dungeon, and with every level descended, the stench in the air grew stronger.

"Your Highness, this is too dangerous," said Carter Lannis, the Chief Knight who rushed over as soon as he learned that the prince was going to visit the witch, attempting to dissuade him every step of the way. Moreover, the king's command tactic was ineffective against him—he refused to accept any orders that would put the prince's life at risk, and there was no convincing him to leave.

Despite having a cold and handsome face, why was he such a chatterbox? Roland really wanted to have someone sew his mouth shut. "How can one have the courage to defeat evil if they dare not face it? I thought you understood this."

"Fight evil within your means, recklessness is not bravery."

"So you're saying we can stand for justice against enemies weaker than us, but should turn a blind eye to those stronger?"

"No, Your Highness, what I mean is..."

"Fearful of witches breaking out of prison before, and now afraid to see a young girl, my Chief Knight is truly one of a kind."

Although the knight was talkative, he was not good at arguing forcefully, and naturally had no defense against the verbal powerhouse Roland. While they were talking, the group had reached the bottom of the dungeon.

This place was much smaller than the levels above, with only two cells in total.

The jailer lit the torches on the wall, and as the darkness receded, Roland saw the witch curled up in the corner.

It was now deep autumn, and the temperature in the dungeon was so low that one could see their own breath. He was wearing a fur coat with a silk lining inside, naturally not feeling the cold. But the other party only had a thin dress that couldn't fully cover her body, and her arms and feet exposed to the air had turned pale from the cold.

The sudden bright light made her turn her head away, her eyes slightly closed. But soon, she opened her eyes again and looked straight over.

Those were a pair of light blue eyes, calm like a lake before a storm. There was no fear on her face, nor was there anger or hatred.

Roland had an illusion, as if what he was seeing was not a weak young girl, but a shadow engulfing flames. For a moment, he felt that the light from the torches on the wall dimmed a bit.

She struggled to stand up against the wall, her movements so slow as if she could fall at any moment. But in the end, she stood up completely and staggered into the area where the light could fully cover her.

With such a simple action, it made everyone present gasp in shock, retreating two steps back, with only the knight swiftly stepping forward to protect them.
"What is your name?" Roland patted the knight's shoulder, signaling him not to be so tense.
"Anna," she replied.
