## Witch Anna (Part 2)
Roland swallowed the last piece of fried egg and wiped his mouth with a napkin, "After all that's been said, are you worried that the Witch Cooperation Association might hear that she's not dead and come to rescue her?"

"Exactly, Your Highness," Barov stamped his foot, "They must be in a hurry, probably on the road. If that witch were dead, it would be one thing, but she's still alive! Those lunatics even steal babies; they probably won't let go of a fallen companion."



Roland was somewhat puzzled; he always felt that something was not quite right. Why did the assistant minister and the chief knight feel like they were facing a formidable enemy whenever they talked about witches?

The woman who was to be hanged was a witch, wasn't she? She was so emaciated that it seemed a gust of wind could knock her down. If she possessed terrible powers, why would she stand there to be slaughtered? No, she wouldn't have been caught at all. According to the church, she was the incarnation of the devil; apart from the Judgement Army, any mortal army would pay a heavy price in front of a witch. Yet, this devil was captured by the residents of Border Town, tortured in every possible way until she was brought to the gallows, and her terrible powers were nowhere to be seen.



"How was she captured?"



"It is said that during a collapse in the Northern Slope Mine, she revealed her identity in an attempt to escape and was caught by the angry villagers."



Roland thought for a moment, hmm, he remembered that incident; it happened the day before he transmigrated.



"How did she reveal herself?"



"I'm not very clear on that," the assistant minister shook his head, "The situation was very chaotic at the time. Someone must have seen her using witchcraft."



Roland frowned, "You didn't investigate this matter thoroughly?"



"Your Highness, resuming production in the mines is a priority," the Minister Assistant protested. "Half of Border Town's fiscal revenue relies on this iron ore, and the prosecutor has also confirmed that there were people killed by witchcraft at the scene."



"What kind of witchcraft?" Roland's interest was piqued.



"It looked as if they had melted, their heads and the better part of their bodies spread out on the ground, reminiscent of burnt-out black candles," the other said with a look of disgust. "Your Highness, you wouldn't want to see such a scene."



Roland toyed with the silver fork in his hand, lost in thought. Throughout history, most victims of witch hunts were innocents. They were used by the Church and ignorant people as tools for venting anger, while a small portion were authors of their own destruction. These individuals garbed themselves in odd costumes, tossing all kinds of strange ingredients into pots every day, claiming they could predict the future and determine life and death.



They indeed figured out some tricks, such as using flame color reactions to claim they had obtained the power of the gods.



To modern eyes, all this was mere chemical trickery, but at the time, it was easily misconstrued as miraculous phenomena.



As for melting a person, Roland's first thought was chromic acid cleaning solution, but that substance was troublesome to prepare, required complete immersion of the body, and the effect of dissolving a corpse was far from resembling a candle. As for other strong acids, they were even less likely.



So how did this witch accomplish this feat?



If she relies on alchemy, then she is a rare chemist in the territory, if not...



Roland thought to this point, and made up his mind.



"Take me to see her."



"Wait... wait a minute, Your Highness, you want to see a witch?" Barov stood up anxiously, knocking over the cup of milk he hadn't drunk.



"Yes, that's an order." Roland turned back and smiled at the assistant minister, now truly somewhat thankful for the fourth prince's unreasonable manner.



As he walked to the door, he suddenly paused, "Right, I've always wanted to ask, why hanging?"



"What?"



"Why hanging? Shouldn't witches be tied to a stake and burned to death?"



Barov looked completely baffled, "Is that so? But she doesn't fear fire."



Border Town only had one dungeon, as the barren land couldn't support too many prisoners, and most criminals faced trial within a few days of their arrival—either to be released or executed.



Besides Barov, those who followed the prince into the dungeon included the Chief Knight, the warden, the jailer, and two guards.



The dungeon had four levels, all built with hard granite. It was Roland's first time in such a place, and he noticed that the passages became narrower the further down they went, and the number of cells decreased correspondingly. It was probably like digging out an inverted cone and then stacking it up layer by layer with stones, he thought.



Such rough construction naturally wouldn't have good drainage, and the ground was damp and filthy, with murky sewage flowing along, seeping down the stairs step by step.



The witch was locked in the lowest level of the dungeon, and with each descent, the stench in the air grew denser.



"Your Highness, this is too dangerous. Even if she is bound by the God's Punishment Chains, it does not guarantee safety."



The speaker was Carter Lannis, the Chief Knight who rushed over as soon as he found out that the prince intended to visit the witch, and he had not ceased to try to dissuade him along the way. Moreover, the command of the king did not work on him—he refused to accept any order that disregarded the prince's life, and it was impossible to make him leave.



Even though he had the face of a handsome and aloof god, why was he such a chatterbox? Roland really wanted to sew his mouth shut. "How can one have the courage to defeat evil if they dare not face it directly? I thought you understood that."



"Fighting evil must also be done within your means, recklessness does not equal bravery."

"Does that mean we can uphold justice against enemies weaker than ourselves, but should turn a blind eye when facing stronger ones?"

"No, Your Highness, what I mean is..."

"Fearing the witch's jailbreak before, and now fearing a meeting with a young girl, my Chief Knight is truly one of a kind."

Although the knight was talkative, he was not good at arguing forcefully. Faced with the strong verbal fighter Roland, he naturally had no power to resist. Taking advantage of the moment, the group had already arrived at the bottom of the dungeon.

This place was much smaller than the levels above, with only two cells in total.

The jailer lit the torches on the wall, and as the darkness faded away, Roland saw the witch curled up in the corner of the cell.

It was now deep autumn, and the temperature in the dungeon was so low that one could see their own breath. He was wearing a fur coat with a silk lining inside and naturally did not feel cold. But the other party had only a thin garment, which could not fully cover her body. Her arms and feet exposed outside were frozen to the point of losing color.

The sudden light made her turn her head away, her eyes slightly closed. But soon, she opened her eyes again and looked straight back.



Those were a pair of light blue eyes, as calm as a lake before a storm. There was no fear on her face, nor could one see anger or hatred.



Roland had an illusion, as if what he saw was not a frail little girl, but a shadow engulfing flames. For a moment, he felt the light from the torches on the wall dimmed.



She struggled to stand up against the wall, her movements so slow it seemed as though she might fall at any moment. But eventually, she managed to stand upright and staggered out of the corner into an area fully covered by light.



Such a simple action made everyone around gasp in shock, stepping back two paces, except for the knight who quickly moved to stand in front of Roland.



"What's your name?" Roland patted the knight's shoulder, signaling him there was no need to be so tense.



"Anna," she replied.
