## "Stage"
The day after returning to Border Town Castle, Iron Axe brought all the intelligence he had gathered from his interrogations.



"These people are just Timothy's vanguard?" Roland asked, frowning.



"Indeed, Your Highness," Iron Axe nodded, "just as you had previously speculated, sending one militia force after another to attack the Western Territory is Timothy·Wimbledon's strategy. Besides the Western Territory, he's using the same method against Grace·Wimbledon at Clearwater Harbor."



"Are they all civilians?"



"Not entirely, there are criminals, rats, and mostly refugees gathered from all over," he replied, "according to the enemy knights, after Timothy conscripted these people, he stabilized them with some verbal promises, and then they took the first batch of pills. By then, they were forced to be controlled by Timothy, wanting more pills to relieve their pain and cravings."



"But they don't know that once they swallow the pills, there is no possibility of treatment," Roland sighed deeply, "more pills are just a way to delay the inevitable death."



"Yes, Your Highness. Timothy did not tell the militia about the side effects of the medicine; they fully believed that after fighting for the 'new king,' they would receive the promised status and rewards."



"What is the objective of this force?" Roland asked.



"Border Town," Iron Axe answered quickly, "because the now-deceased Sir Vincent believed that the town, lacking walls, would be easier to wear down in a war of attrition. He estimated that a thousand pill-taking militia could be exchanged for around three thousand casualties, which would be a heavy blow to Border Town. However..."



"But what?"

"Snack also confessed that Timothy has given them another task, which is to divide the militia into several batches to attack the town, ensuring their own safety while observing your response and combat effectiveness. I think... he must have noticed the problem that no leading knights returned from the last attack."

"No one returned this time either," the prince shrugged. "Since it's a vanguard force meant to be expended, do these two know Timothy's follow-up attack plans?"

"Not much, but the scale will be much larger than the previous two attacks."

Roland felt a surge of irritation at the thought. All this living labor, just to be used up wave by wave as cannon fodder? Even if he emerged unscathed from defeating the enemy, it would still be a pyrrhic victory. More important than repelling Timothy's invasion was to stop this senseless war—otherwise, after unifying Greycastle, how long would he have to wait for the population to flourish again?

"After the Evil Months come, the entire Western Region will be covered in heavy snow, making it difficult for large troops to advance overland. If relying on shipping, the line would be very long and not only costly but also vulnerable to interception along the way," he said. "So if he wants to launch this round of offensives this year, he must act before the winter snow arrives. The scavenging of the population needs to be even earlier, at least before winter, to complete the conscription of the militia."

"You plan to..."

Roland closed his eyes, pondered for a moment, and then continued, "I want to delay this war."

"Send an envoy or a diplomatic letter to him? Timothy Wimbledon is unlikely to comply with your wishes," Iron Axe said in a heavy tone.



"No, that would not be very useful," he said slowly, "To make the enemy abandon the idea of attacking, first we need to reduce the population they can loot, and second, make them realize that a war of attrition is not worth it and to be wary of the Western Region. I originally planned to have Barov arrange for his subordinates to spread the news of the Western Region's pioneering efforts, attracting the impoverished population outside the city to go there on their own, but now it seems that the effect is too slow, and the measures are too conservative. If we want to take the population away before Timothy does, we must actively reach out and recruit them like we did on the last trip to the king's city. The most important areas are the war-torn Southern Territory, followed by the Northern Region of the kingdom, and this would probably require the First Army to carry out."



"If it's just recruitment, a small team of fifty people should be enough," Iron Axe said without hesitation, "After all, it's not an operation near the city, and there's no need to worry about direct confrontation with the enemy."



"I'll discuss the specific plan with you after I've thought it through," Roland nodded.



A main force must be stationed in Border Town, and the squads sent out must also return to the town before the Evil Months. In addition to this, there were the problems of gold royals and food: a more proactive recruitment policy would naturally bring back more people, but the cost would also increase exponentially. The previous plan was cost-effective, but now it carried a strong sense of purpose, and how to implement it needed careful consideration.



"But the second point you mentioned... how do we do that?"



"First, we release the news that the captured civilians will be sent back to the king's city, so Timothy will have a rough idea of the battle process—after such fruitless attempts, he should not try repeatedly."



"But that would also expose our way of fighting with artillery," Iron Axe worried.



"It won't reveal much," Roland said, tapping the table lightly, "Apart from the long-range strikes and astonishing power, he won't know the principle, much less be able to produce it." As long as the production level remains at this era, even if he knows, he won't be able to counter it. This is the overwhelming advantage of firearms over cold weapons, which won't be reversed by will, tactics, or numbers. "And these people will also bring him a warning letter."



"A warning letter?"



"Indeed, I will announce the date of the attack in advance through the letter, and then launch a surprise attack on the capital that very day," the prince said, word by word.



Iron Axe couldn't help but gape, and it took him a good while to recover before he stood at attention and saluted solemnly, "As long as it is Your Highness's command, I will swear to complete it to the death!"



"Relax, I'm not thinking of sending you to your death," Roland chuckled, "This plan doesn't require the participation of the First Army; it will be carried out by the witches."



How could he make Timothy wary of the Western Territory? He guessed that nothing would shock the opponent more than a direct strike at the royal palace. As long as Timothy realized that he was not safe, it was likely that any plans to deploy troops would be held back.



The plan Roland envisioned was inspired by the airdrop leaflets of later generations. Apart from dropping leaflets, he also planned to deliver two aerial bombs to Timothy—the so-called surprise attack was indeed a strike from the sky. The likelihood of directly killing the new king was slim, but as long as it served as a deterrent, it would be considered a successful operation.



With this, it would be difficult to determine whether the opponent would still insist on launching a large-scale offensive.



Roland was keenly aware that the pattern of this battle for the throne had changed. He was no longer as weak as when he first arrived, needing to disguise and hide himself. Now was the time to reveal his hand, to step by step ascend onto Greycastle's political stage, to make the people of the kingdom aware of his presence—this had nothing to do with a desire to show off, but rather was a proclamation of his own territory and power.



There was no use in inheriting a kingdom littered with corpses and ruins. He hoped that through this declaration, more people would move to the Western Territory and stand by his side.



As the sun dipped behind the mountains, Roland pushed open the window of his office. The evening breeze that brushed his face was no longer scorching, but carried a hint of coolness.



Autumn arrived.
