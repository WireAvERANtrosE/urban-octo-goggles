## "Stage"
The day after returning to Border Town's castle, Iron Axe brought all the intelligence he had gathered from his interrogations.



"These people are just Timothy's vanguard?" Roland frowned.



"Indeed, Your Highness," Iron Axe nodded, "just as you previously speculated, dispatching militias one after another to attack the Western Territory is Timothy · Wimbledon's strategy. In addition to the Western Territory, he also employed the same method against Grace · Wimbledon in Clearwater Harbor."



"They are all civilians?"



"Not all of them, there are criminals, rats, and mostly refugees gathered from various places," he replied, "according to the enemy knights, after Timothy forcibly conscripted these people, he first stabilized them with some verbal promises, then they took the first batch of pills. In this way, they had no choice but to be controlled by Timothy, wanting to get more pills to relieve the pain and craving."



"But they don't know that once they swallow the pills, there is no possibility of treatment," Roland sighed deeply, "more pills are just a way to delay death."



"Yes, Your Highness. Timothy did not tell the militia about the side effects of the drugs, they fully believe that after fighting for the 'new king', they would receive the status and rewards promised to them."



"What is the objective of this force?" Roland asked.



"Border Town," Iron Axe quickly replied, "because the late Sir Vincent believed that the town, without walls, was an easier target for a war of attrition, he estimated that a thousand militia taking the pills could inflict about three thousand casualties in return, which would be a heavy blow to Border Town. However..."



"However, what?" 

"Snack also confessed that Timothy gave them another task, which was to attack the town with the militia in several batches, ensuring their own safety while observing your response and combat effectiveness. I think... he must have noticed the problem that no leading knight returned from the last attack." 

"No one returned this time either," the prince shrugged. "Since they are used as an expendable vanguard, do these two know about Timothy's subsequent attack plans?" 

"Not much, but the scale will be much larger than the previous two attacks." 

Roland felt a surge of hatred in his heart. All that living labor was being wasted wave after wave as cannon fodder? Even if he managed to defeat the enemy without a scratch, it would still be a pyrrhic victory. More important than resisting Timothy's invasion was to put an end to this senseless war—otherwise, after unifying Greycastle, how long would he have to wait for the population to flourish again? 

"After the Evil Months come, the entire Western Territory will be covered with heavy snow, and large troops will struggle to move. If they rely on ships, the line will be very long, not only costly but also easy to be intercepted along the way," he said. "So if he wants to launch this round of offense this year, he must act before the winter snow arrives. The looting of the population has to be even earlier, at least before winter, to complete the conscription of the militia." 

"You plan to..." 

Roland closed his eyes, pondered for a moment, and then continued, "I want to delay this war." 

"Send him an envoy or a diplomatic letter? Timothy Wimbledon is unlikely to comply with your wishes," Iron Axe said in a deep voice.



"No, that won't be very effective," he said slowly, "To make the enemy give up the idea of attacking, firstly, we need to reduce the population they can plunder, and secondly, make them realize that a war of attrition is not worth it and to be wary of the Western Territory. I was planning to have Barov arrange for his subordinates to spread the news of pioneering the Western Territory to attract the poor population outside the city to go there voluntarily, but now it seems that the effect is too slow, and the measures are too conservative. To move the population before Timothy does, we must actively reach out and recruit them like the last trip to the capital. The most important areas are the war-torn Southern Territory, followed by the northern lands of the kingdom. I guess we'll need to deploy the First Army for this."



"A squad of fifty people would be enough just for the recruitment," Iron Axe interjected without hesitation, "After all, we're not operating near the city, and we don't have to worry about direct confrontations with the enemy."



"I'll discuss the specific plan with you after I've thought it through," Roland nodded.



A main force must be stationed in Border Town, and the squads sent out must return to the town before the Evil Months. In addition to that, there are issues with Gold royals and food supplies: a more aggressive recruitment policy will naturally bring back more people, but the cost will also increase dramatically. The previous plan was cost-effective, but now it needs to be executed with a strong sense of purpose, and must be carefully considered.



"But your second point... how do we do that?"



"First, we release the news that the captured civilians are being sent back to the capital. This way, Timothy will have a rough idea of the battle process—such fruitless efforts, he is unlikely to try repeatedly."



"But our method of fighting with cannons will also be exposed," Iron Axe expressed his concern.



"Not much will be exposed," Roland tapped lightly on the table, "Aside from the long-range strikes and astonishing power, he cannot understand the principle, let alone manufacture them." As long as the production level remains in this era, even if he knows, he cannot counter it. This is the overwhelming advantage of firearms over cold weapons, which will not change due to will, tactics, or numbers. "And these people will also bring him a warning letter."



"A warning letter?"



"Indeed, I will announce the date of the attack in advance in the letter, and then launch a surprise assault on the capital on that day," the prince said, word by word.

Iron Axe couldn't help but gape, and it took him a while to recover before he stood at attention and saluted solemnly, "As long as it is your command, I will carry it out to the death!"

"Relax, I'm not thinking of sending you to your death," Roland smiled, "This plan does not require the involvement of the First Army, but will be executed by the witches."

How could he make Timothy wary of the Western Region? He reckoned that nothing would be more shocking to the opponent than a direct strike on the royal palace. As long as Timothy realized he was not safe, it was likely that any plans to deploy troops would be restrained.

The plan Roland envisioned was inspired by the modern practice of airdropping leaflets, but in addition to dropping leaflets, he also planned to send Timothy two aerial bombs—the so-called surprise attack was a strike from the sky. The likelihood of directly killing the new king was slim, but as long as it served as a deterrence, it would be considered a successful operation.

With this, it would be difficult to determine whether the opponent would still insist on launching a large-scale attack.

Roland was acutely aware that the pattern of the battle for the throne had changed; he was no longer as weak as when he first arrived and needed to disguise and hide himself. Now was the time to reveal his hand, to step onto the political stage of Greycastle step by step, and to make the people of the kingdom aware of his presence—not out of a desire to show off, but as a way to advertise his territory and power.

Obtaining a kingdom littered with corpses and ruins was pointless; he hoped that through this demonstration, more people would travel to the Western Region and stand by his side.

As the sun dipped behind the mountains, Roland pushed open the windows of his office. The evening breeze that brushed his face was no longer scorching, but carried a hint of coolness.



Autumn arrived.
