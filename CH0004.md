## Flame
"What exactly happened during the mine collapse? Tell me again in detail."

Anna nodded and began to narrate.

Roland felt somewhat surprised.

He had thought she would remain silent, plead, or curse, but she simply cooperated and answered whatever he asked.

The story wasn't overly complicated. Anna's father was a miner, working in the tunnels when the collapse occurred. Upon hearing the news, Anna immediately entered the mine with other miners' families to attempt a rescue. The North Slope Mine was rumored to have once been the lair of underground creatures, with many branching paths leading in all directions. Because the rescuers lacked unified command, they scattered after entering the mine to search on their own. When Anna found her father, only Susan from next door and Uncle Onk were there with her.

She discovered her father pinned under a cart full of ore, his legs crushed and immobile, while a miner squatted beside him rifling through his pockets for coins. When his robbery was interrupted, the miner took up a hoe and struck Uncle Onk to the ground. Just as he was about to deliver a fatal blow, Anna killed him first.

The couple next door swore not to speak of her deeds, and together the three of them rescued Anna's father. But before dawn the next day, Anna's father, leaning on his crutches, went out and reported to the patrolling guards that his daughter was a witch.

"Why?" Roland could not help but turn his head and ask.

Barov sighed, "Probably for the bounty. Whoever discovers and reports a witch can get 25 Gold royals. For a man with a broken leg, those 25 Gold royals are the security for the rest of his life."

Roland was silent for a moment, "The man was a strong, able-bodied adult. How did you manage to kill him?"

At that moment, Anna smiled. It was like ripples spreading across a lake, and the flames of the torches flickered.

"It's the so-called power of the devil that you speak of."

"Shut up, witch!" the jailer shouted, but the tremor in his voice could be heard by all.

"Is that so? I'd like to see," the Fourth Prince remained unmoved.

"Your Highness, this is no joking matter!" the Chief Knight turned his head and said with a frown.

Roland stepped out from behind the knight and walked step by step towards the cell, "Those who are afraid are free to leave. I didn't ask for you to stay here."



"Don't panic, she still has the God's Punishment Chain around her neck!" Barov loudly reassured everyone, as if to reassure himself, "Even the strongest devil cannot break the protection of God."



Standing in front of the prison bars, Roland and Anna were only an arm's distance apart. He could clearly see the dust-covered and scarred cheeks of the other party. Her youthful features meant she was not yet of age, but her expression did not capture the slightest trace of naivety. More than that, even anger was hard to find—this kind of dissonance Roland had only seen on television. It was the look of wandering orphans tormented by poverty, hunger, cold, and other miseries when they were interviewed. But it was not exactly the same; the wandering orphans always hunched their bodies and lowered their heads in front of the camera, whereas Anna did not.



Even now, she was still trying to stand straight, her gaze slightly uplifted, calmly looking into the prince's eyes.



She was not afraid of death, Roland realized; she was waiting for death.



"Is this your first time seeing a witch, my lord? Your curiosity might kill you," came a voice.



"If it really was the power of the devil, just one glance would bring misfortune," Roland replied, "then it shouldn't be me who dies, but your father."



The light of the fire in the cell suddenly dimmed. This was definitely not an illusion. The flames were as if suppressed by something, and soon only a small cluster remained. He heard rapid breathing and prayers from behind him, and the dull thud of someone falling in panic.



Roland's heartbeat gradually accelerated. He felt as though he was at a wondrous threshold, with the world of common sense on one side, operating meticulously according to the planned constants and laws. On the other side was the incredible world, filled with mystery and the unknown. He was now standing at the gateway to this new world.



Was that on her neck the God's Punishment Chain? Such a crude chain, a red-painted iron link hanging a crystal clear pendant—if it wasn't for the witch's hands being firmly shackled behind her back, wouldn't this thing break as soon as it was pulled?



Roland glanced back at the crowd, and while everyone was still panicked and praying, he quickly reached into the cage, grabbed the pendant, and yanked hard. The clasp between the pendant and the chain broke with a snap—the action even startled Anna.



"Come," he whispered. Are you a fraud, a chemist, or a real witch?



If you pull out bottles and jars now and start mixing strong acids, I will be disappointed, he thought.



Then Roland heard a crackling sound, the sound of water vapor expanding from heat—white mist rose from the ground, and the surrounding temperature soared rapidly.



He saw flames rising from beneath the girl's feet, gently licking her bare lower legs, and then the ground where she stood caught fire. The torches behind simultaneously burst open, as if they had received pure oxygen, emitting a dazzling light. The entire cell was as bright as day, accompanied by the terrified screams of the people.



The witch stepped forward, and the flames followed her steps, weaving along. When she reached the edge of the prison, dozens of iron bars turned into pillars of fire.



Roland had to retreat, the scorching air biting at his skin, causing unbearable pain. In just a few breaths, he felt as if he had gone from late autumn back to midsummer. No, unlike the summer heat, this high temperature generated purely by the flames could not envelop him completely. The heat wave came rolling in from the side facing the fire, while the opposite side was chillingly cold. He even felt cold sweat on his back.



"She does not fear the flames."

Roland recalled the words of the minister's aide. It was not until this moment that he fully understood the meaning of those words.

She herself is a flame, how could she possibly fear herself?

Quickly, the iron bars turned from dark red to bright yellow, beginning to melt and deform. This meant that they had been heated to over fifteen hundred degrees. To achieve this without any insulation measures greatly exceeded Roland's imagination. Like the others, he had already moved far from the cell, pressing tightly against the stone wall at the farthest distance.

If they did not do so, the high heat from the molten iron could cause their clothes to catch fire even without direct contact—like Anna, whose prison clothes had long turned to ashes, her body surrounded by roaring flames.

No one knew how long it lasted, but eventually the flames completely receded.

Only a small section of the torch on the wall continued to burn quietly, as if nothing had happened. But the sweat-drenched clothes, the scorching air, and the cell bars burned as if they were the claws of a devil, all told everyone that this was not a dream.

Apart from Roland and the knight, everyone else had collapsed on the ground, with the jailer even having wet his pants from fright.

Anna, naked, now stood outside the cage, the shackles that had trapped her arms nowhere to be seen. She did not cover her body, her hands naturally hanging at her sides, her lake-blue eyes regaining their prior calmness.

"I have satisfied your curiosity, my lord," she said, "Can you kill me now?"

"No," Roland stepped forward and wrapped his coat around her, saying in the gentlest tone possible, "Miss Anna, I would like to employ you."
