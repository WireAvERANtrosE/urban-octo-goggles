## Flame
"What exactly happened during the mine collapse? Tell me again in detail."

Anna nodded and began to narrate.

Roland felt somewhat surprised.

He had assumed that she would remain silent, plead, or even curse, but she simply cooperated with his questions, answering whatever was asked.

The story wasn't very complicated. Anna's father was a miner, working in the tunnels during the collapse. Upon hearing the news, Anna immediately joined the other miners' relatives to enter the mine for the rescue. The Northern Slope Mine was rumored to have once been a nest of underground creatures, with many branching paths leading every which way. As the rescuers lacked a unified command, they scattered after entering the mine to search on their own. When Anna found her father, only Aunt Susan from next door and Uncle Onk were present.

She discovered that her father's legs had been crushed under a cart full of ore, rendering him immobile, while a miner nearby was squatting down, pilfering the coins from his body. When his robbery was discovered, the miner charged with a pickaxe and knocked Uncle Onk to the ground. Just as he was about to deliver a killing blow, Anna killed him first.

The couple from next door swore not to speak of what she had done, and the three of them together rescued Anna's father. But before daybreak the next day, Anna's father, leaning on his crutches, went out and reported to the patrol guards that his daughter was a witch.

"Why?" Roland couldn't help but turn his head and ask.

Barov sighed, "Probably for the bounty, I guess. Whoever discovers and reports a witch can receive 25 Gold Royals. For someone with a broken leg, those 25 Gold Royals could secure the rest of his life."



Roland fell silent for a moment. "The man was a strong and powerful adult male, how did you kill him?"



It was at this moment that Anna smiled. It was like ripples spreading across a lake's surface, causing the flame at the tip of the torch to flicker.



"It's what you call the power of the devil."



"Shut up, witch!" The jailer shouted, but the tremble in his voice was audible to everyone.



"Is that so? I'd like to see that." The Fourth Prince remained unmoved.



"Your Highness, this is no joking matter!" The Chief Knight turned around and frowned.



Roland stepped out from behind the knight and walked toward the cell. "Those who are afraid can leave first. I didn't ask you to stay here."



"Don't panic, she still wears the God's Punishment Chains around her neck!" Barov shouted to reassure everyone, as well as himself, "No devil is powerful enough to break God's protection."



Standing in front of the prison bars, Roland and Anna were only an arm's length apart. He could clearly see her face, covered in dust and scars. Her youthful features suggested she was not yet an adult, but there was no trace of immaturity in her expression. In fact, it was difficult to find even a hint of anger—this incongruence Roland had only seen on TV before. It was the look of homeless orphans who had suffered through poverty, hunger, cold, and hardship during interviews. Yet it was not quite the same; homeless orphans would always hunch their bodies and lower their heads in front of the camera, but Anna did not.



Until now, she still tried to stand straight, her gaze slightly uplifted, boldly looking directly into the prince's eyes.

She was not afraid of death, Roland realized, she was waiting for it.

"Is this your first time seeing a witch, my lord? Your curiosity might kill you," she said.

"If it really was the power of the devil, just one look would bring misfortune," Roland replied, "then it shouldn't be me who dies, but your father."

The light from the cage's fire suddenly dimmed; it was absolutely not an illusion. The flames seemed to be suppressed by something and quickly reduced to a small flicker. He heard rapid breathing and prayers behind him, as well as the muffled thud of someone falling over in their panic.

Roland's heartbeat gradually quickened; he felt as though he was at an extraordinary boundary. On one side was the world of common sense, operating meticulously according to its well-planned constants and laws. On the other side lay a world of wonder, filled with mystery and the unknown. He now stood at the gates of this new world.

Was that the God's Punishment Chain hanging around her neck? What a crude chain it was—a piece of iron chain painted red, hanging a crystal-clear pendant. If it weren't for the shackles binding the witch's hands firmly behind her back, wouldn't this thing break with just a pull?

Roland glanced back at the crowd, and taking advantage of their panicked prayers, he quickly reached into the cage, grabbed the pendant, and yanked hard. The clasp between the pendant and the chain broke with a snap—even Anna was stunned by this action.

"Come," he said softly. Are you a charlatan, an alchemist, or a true witch?



If you bring out bottles and jars now to start concocting strong acid, I will be disappointed, he thought to himself.



Then Roland heard a crackling sound, the sound of steam expanding from heat—the ground gave off white mist, and the surrounding temperature soared rapidly.



He saw flames rising from beneath the girl's feet, gently licking her exposed calves, and then the ground where she stood burst into flames. The torches behind her exploded simultaneously, bursting into a dazzling light as if they had received pure oxygen. The entire cell was as bright as daylight for a moment, accompanied by the terrified screams of the crowd.



The witch stepped forward, and the flames followed her movements. When she reached the edge of the cell, dozens of iron bars turned into pillars of fire.



Roland had to back away, the scorching air tore at his skin, causing unbearable pain. In just a few breaths, it felt like he had gone from late autumn back to the height of summer. No, unlike the scorching heat of summer, this intense heat produced purely by flames did not envelop him completely. A wave of heat assaulted him from the side facing the flames, while the other side was chillingly cold. He even felt himself breaking out in a cold sweat.



—She is not afraid of the flames.



Roland recalled the words of the assistant minister. It was not until this moment that he truly understood the meaning of those words.



She herself is the flame, how could she possibly fear herself?



Soon, the iron bars turned from deep red to bright yellow and began to melt and deform. This meant they had been heated to over fifteen hundred degrees. To achieve this without any insulation measures was far beyond Roland's imagination. Like the others, he had already moved away from the cell, pressing tightly against the stone wall at the farthest distance.



If she did not do so, the high heat from the molten iron could ignite her clothes even without direct contact—as was the case with Anna, whose prison garb had already turned to ashes, her body engulfed by roaring flames.

It was unclear how long it lasted before the flames finally subsided.

Only a small section of the torch on the wall continued to burn quietly, as if nothing had happened. But the sweat-soaked clothes, the hot air, and the prison bars charred like the claws of a demon, all testified that this was no dream.

Aside from Roland and the knights who remained standing, everyone else had collapsed to the ground, with the jailer even wetting his pants from fright.

Naked, Anna now stood outside the cage, the shackles that had imprisoned her arms nowhere to be seen. She did not attempt to cover her body, her hands naturally hanging at her sides, her lake-blue eyes regaining their prior calmness.

"I have satisfied your curiosity, my lord," she said. "Can you kill me now?"

"No," Roland stepped forward, draping his coat over her, and spoke in as gentle a tone as possible, "Miss Anna, I would like to hire you."
