## Railway Minecart
Over half a month has passed since the capture of Longsong Stronghold, and the population and materials transported from the five major families of the Western Region have all arrived.



After the establishment of the Ministry of Agriculture, the spring plowing of the new year finally began, which was also the first step for Roland to explore farming techniques. The serfs, seeing the dawn of promotion to freemen, worked with great enthusiasm. The scene of overseers whipping serfs to urge them to work was basically extinct on the south bank of the Redwater River. Some serfs discovered that even if they were lazy, no one came to control them—according to the municipal officials who carried strange tools and measured the fields, the lord did not care about the yield of one or two fields, and from now on, the serfs were farming for themselves, with the more diligent receiving more.



It wasn’t that the officials of the Ministry of Agriculture were so excellent that they had fully grasped the principle of distribution according to labor, but rather that Roland required them to repeat these contents to the serfs again and again. To reinforce the indoctrination effect and satisfy the prince's own sentiment, red flags were planted along the banks of the Redwater River, banners were raised, with slogans such as "Labor is the only path to wealth," "Labor is glorious," and "Labor leads to freedom, labor changes destiny" written on them.



Of course, there were those who raised objections to these measures, such as Barov, who was the first to stand up against it.



"Your Highness, this is completely meaningless. Most of the serfs are illiterate, they don't care what is written on the banners. These people are both ignorant and foolish, sometimes even a whip doesn't work, let alone some inexplicable words."



Roland's answer was simple, "Those banners are not meant for them to read."



"Then why are you doing this?" The assistant minister looked quite puzzled at the time.



"To create living examples."



He never believed that serfs were stupid and irredeemable. Their lack of education did not mean they were devoid of thought. Even the dullest person could be driven by desire and benefit, which is human nature—the seemingly ineffective repeated indoctrination by the agricultural commissioner would leave a seed in their minds, like a trickle of water, eventually coming together. When the first group of serfs was promoted to freemen, when they exchanged their harvested crops for money, and bought high-quality clothing, exquisite food, and even sturdy and warm brick houses, the slogans repeated over and over would resoundingly become reality and be deeply imprinted in their hearts.



As for the banners on the shore, they were intended for the townspeople who had received universal education.

To escape poverty using one's own hands, to become an official member of Border Town, and perhaps even surpass those who were native residents—such is the power of hard work.

Only through comparison can one feel the disparity, and only by actively pursuing can an individual's efficiency be maximized.

...

Ironhead stood at the entrance of the mine, waiting for the next round of ore to come out.

Ever since the Evil Months, when half of his face was scalded by high-temperature steam, he dared not stand near that black machine again.

Fortunately, in Border Town, there was a kind-hearted angel like Miss Nana. Ironhead touched his face, now as good as new, and felt immensely grateful. He had even suspected her of being a devil's minion, which was simply a blasphemy against her. After winter ended, he specifically brought two salted fish and a wild boar leg to the Pine family as an apology.

What surprised him even more was that, although Titus Pine was a viscount, he did not have the noble habit of looking down on others and accepted his apology with open arms. For the first time, Ironhead felt that not all nobles were cold and heartless.

"Ironhead," a miner covered in dust ran out of the tunnel, "the rope has been tied."



"Mm," he turned his head towards the direction of the steam engine and shouted, "Everyone, step back! Vlak, lift the green lever and then press down the red lever! If you do it wrong, I'll twist your head off!"

"Don't worry, Iron Head, I've got it!" Vlak responded loudly.



After sending Nails to join the First Army of the town, Iron Head had someone else operate the steam engine. In the first few days, Vlak often messed up the order of the levers, causing the air delivery pipes to burst, and he had not been spared from Iron Head's hefty beatings. Fortunately, His Highness the Prince did not take this matter to heart, not only did he send people to replace the damaged parts, but he also did not fine them — Iron Head had already braced for everyone to lose a month's salary.



With the intake valve opened, the steam engine spewed out billowing white vapor, and the main wheel slowly turned, driving the winch to pull the hemp rope taut.



"Stay sharp, everyone! Keep an eye on the hemp rope, watch closely!" Iron Head shouted.



Now, besides the steam engine, the way ore was extracted from the mine had also changed.



His Highness the Prince ordered craftsmen to carve pieces of wood into long strips, connect them end to end and lay them in the mining area, and then insert wooden blocks under two wooden bars, at first glance, it looked like many wooden grids put together.



His Highness called it the wooden rail transport system, a quite tongue-twisting name. It looked simple, but when paired with the specially designed mining carts, hey! It was truly efficient. Ore that usually took three or four days to transport could all be hauled out in one go by the steam engine with a few mining carts linked together.



Iron Head had specifically observed these four-wheeled trolleys running on the wooden rails; they were entirely made of iron, and just one of them was quite valuable. The key to their movement on the narrow wooden strips without falling off lay in their wheels — each small iron wheel had an enlarged flange on the inside, which firmly kept the mining cart on the wooden rails. Atop the wheels was a square iron basin, with grooves at the front and back, allowing for the hemp ropes to be threaded through and form a line.



He couldn't help but admire His Royal Highness's intelligence. Such a simple design could make ore transportation so easy. Before this, dragging these heavy ores out of the mines was the most time-consuming and labor-intensive task.

However, this system was not without flaws. For example, just on the fifth day of use, two sections of the wooden rails were crushed, and then a few more broke intermittently. It was only after His Highness wrapped the top of all the wooden rails with a layer of iron sheet that the situation improved.

In addition, there was an accident in the mine when a hemp rope snapped, which still sends shivers down Iron Axe's spine when he thinks about it. According to the regulations, only four mine carts were to be pulled out of the mine at a time, but on the day of the accident, the miners, in their haste, connected six carts together. As a result, the hemp rope, as thick as an arm, suddenly snapped halfway through the pull. The recoiling rope struck a fellow standing beside Iron Axe, severing his arm and breaking several of his ribs. The mine carts slid down the tracks, knocking down two people and crushing the legs of an unlucky one.

Fortunately, Iron Axe knew what to do in such a situation. He immediately organized people to transport the injured to Viscount Titus's residence. As long as they didn't die on the spot, Miss Nana could heal them completely.

"Ironhead, the carts are out!" someone watching the entrance shouted.

"Fralk, stop the steam engine in ten breaths, and mind the sequence!" Ironhead ordered loudly.

"Got it!"

The four mine carts slowly stopped at the end of the wooden track, and he went over to record the output and the type of ores. The stones in the first two carts were reddish-brown, the most abundant product of the mine—iron ore. The third cart's stones were greyish-yellow, likely copper ore. He paused when he saw the fourth cart; he didn't recall seeing such stones in the records before: they were dark brown and reflected a dim metallic luster in the sunlight.

Another unknown type of ore, Ironhead shook his head. The passages in the North Slope Mine were crisscrossed, and it was common to dig up all kinds of inexplicable things. He drew a cross on the paper and instructed the men to send all the ores to the stockyard. Whether these black stones would end up in the furnace was no concern of his.
