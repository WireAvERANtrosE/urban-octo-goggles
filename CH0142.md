## Railway Minecart
More than half a month had passed since the conquest of Longsong Stronghold, and all the people and supplies sent from the stronghold and the five major families of the Western Region had arrived.



After the establishment of the Ministry of Agriculture, the spring plowing for the new year finally began, which was also the first step for Roland to explore farming techniques. The serfs, seeing the dawn of becoming free citizens, worked with great enthusiasm. The need for overseers to whip the serfs into labor had virtually disappeared on the south bank of the Redwater River. Some serfs found that even if they were lazy, no one came to manage them—according to the strange-tool-toting officials from the City Hall who measured the fields, the lord did not care about the yield of one or two plots of land, as serfs would be farming for themselves in the future, with the more diligent reaping more benefits.



It wasn't that the officials of the Ministry of Agriculture were so exceptional and had fully grasped the principle of distribution according to labor, but rather that Roland required them to constantly repeat these contents to the serfs. To reinforce the indoctrination and to satisfy the prince's own sentiments, the banks of the Redwater River were also filled with red flags and banners with slogans such as "Labor is the only path to wealth," "Labor is glorious," "Labor leads to freedom, labor changes fate," and so on.



Of course, there were those who objected to these measures, such as Barov, who was the first to stand in opposition.



"Your Highness, what you are doing is utterly meaningless. The majority of the serfs are illiterate; they don’t care what is written on the banners. These people are both ignorant and obtuse, sometimes even a whip has no effect, let alone some inexplicable words."



Roland's answer was simple, "Those banners are not meant for them."



"Then why do you still do these things?" The assistant minister looked quite puzzled at the time.



"To create living examples."



He never believed that serfs were stupid and beyond redemption; their lack of education did not mean they were devoid of thought. Even the dullest person could be driven by desire and self-interest, which is human nature—the repeated indoctrination of the Agricultural Commissioner might seem to have little effect, but it would leave a seed in their hearts, like a trickle of water that would eventually join together. When the first batch of serfs were promoted to free citizens, when they exchanged their bumper crops for money and bought fine clothes, exquisite food, and even sturdy, warm brick houses, the slogans repeated over and over would thunderously become reality, deeply branding themselves in their hearts.



As for the banners on the shore, they were for the townspeople who had received universal education to see.

By relying on one's own hands to escape from poverty and become an official member of Border Town, and even possibly surpassing the indigenous people, this is the power of hard work.

Only by comparison can one feel the gap, and only by actively pursuing it can individual efficiency be maximized.

...

Ironhead stood at the entrance of the mine, waiting for a new round of ore to come out.

Ever since the Evil Months when he was scalded by high-temperature steam and half his face was burned, he dared not stand near the black machine anymore.

Fortunately, in Border Town there was a kind angel-like Miss Nana. Ironhead touched his face, which had been restored to its original state, feeling extremely grateful. He had even suspected that she was a minion of the devil, which was simply a blasphemy against her. After the winter ended, he specifically brought two salted fish and a wild boar leg to the Pine family to apologize.

What surprised him even more was that Sir Titus Pine, although a Viscount, did not have the habit of looking down on people like other nobles and graciously accepted his apology. For the first time, Ironhead felt that not all nobles were cold-hearted.

"Ironhead," a miner covered in dust ran out of the tunnel, "the rope has been secured."



"Alright," he turned his head and shouted towards the steam engine, "Everyone back off! Frakk, lift the green lever, then press down the red lever! If you do it wrong, I'll twist your head off!"

"Don't worry, Iron Head, I got this!" Frakk responded loudly.



After sending Nail to join the First Army of the town, Iron Head swapped him out with another person to operate the steam engine. In the first few days, Frakk often mixed up the order of the levers, causing the air delivery pipes to burst, and he took quite a beating for it. Fortunately, His Highness the Prince did not mind this, not only did he send someone to replace the damaged parts, but he also did not deduct their pay—originally, Iron Head had already prepared for everyone to lose a month's salary.



As the intake valve opened, the steam engine spewed out a mighty white vapor. The main wheel slowly turned, driving the winch and stretching the hemp rope taut.



"Keep your spirits up! Keep an eye on the hemp rope, watch it closely!" Iron Head shouted.



Now, aside from the steam engine, the method of extracting ore from the mine had also changed.



His Highness the Prince ordered the craftsmen to whittle pieces of wood into long strips, connect them end to end and lay them out in the mining area, then stuff wooden blocks underneath the two wooden strips. At first glance, it looked like a grid made up of many pieces of wood.



His Highness called it the wooden rail transport system, a quite a mouthful of a name. It didn't look complicated, but paired with the special mining carts, hey! That was truly handy. Ore that normally took three to four days to haul out, by linking several mining carts together, the steam engine could drag it all out in one go.



Iron Head had specifically observed these four-wheeled trolleys running on wooden rails. It was made entirely of iron, and just one of these was quite valuable. Its ability to move on the narrow wooden strips without falling off was key—it was the wheels. Each small iron wheel had an enlarged rim on the inner side, which firmly kept the mining cart on the wooden rails. At the top of the wheels, there was a square iron basin, with curved grooves at the front and back, which could be strung together with hemp ropes into a line.



He could not help but admire His Highness's intelligence, such a simple design could make mining so much easier. Before this, dragging these dead-heavy ores out of the mine tunnels was the most time-consuming and labor-intensive task.



However, this system was not without flaws. For example, on the fifth day of use, two sections of the wooden rails were crushed, followed by several more breaking intermittently. It was only after His Highness wrapped the top of all the wooden rails with a layer of iron sheet that the situation improved.



In addition, there was an incident where a hemp rope snapped in the mine, and Iron Axe still shuddered at the thought. According to regulations, only four mine carts were to be dragged out of the tunnel at a time, but on the day of the incident, the miners, in their haste, linked six carts together. As a result, halfway through, the rope as thick as an arm suddenly snapped. The recoiling end struck a colleague standing next to Iron Axe, severing his arm and breaking several of his ribs. The mine carts slid down the track, knocking over two people and crushing the legs of one unfortunate soul.



Fortunately, Iron Axe knew exactly what to do in such a situation. He immediately organized a team to transport the injured to Viscount Titus's residence. As long as they didn't die on the spot, Miss Nana could heal them completely.



"Ironhead, the carts are out!" someone shouted at the mouth of the tunnel.



"Fralk, stop the steam engine in ten breaths, and pay attention to the sequence!" Iron Axe commanded loudly.



"Got it!"



Four mine carts slowly stopped at the end of the wooden rails, and he went to record the quantity and variety of the shipment. The stones in the first two carts were reddish-brown, which was the most abundant product of the mine—iron ore. The stones in the third cart were grayish-yellow, presumably copper ore, but he paused when he saw the fourth cart. He did not recall seeing such stones in previous records: they were dark brown all over and reflected a dull metallic luster under the sunlight.



Another unknown type of ore, Iron Axe shook his head. The Northern Slope Mine had crisscrossing tunnels, and it was common to dig up all sorts of inexplicable things. He drew a cross on the paper and instructed the workers to send all the ores to the stockyard. Whether these black stones would end up in the furnace was no concern of his.
