## Border Town's laws
At the crack of dawn, Roland was awoken by the cold. He crawled out of the icy bedding, donned a woolen coat, and dipped his feet into a bucket of warm water.

This was a decadent privilege he enjoyed as His Royal Highness the prince—every morning, the maids would place hot water by his bed, along with a clean towel and warm milk to instantly restore warmth to his body.

Of course, compared to the common practice of the nobility to have servants warm their beds, he felt he was quite restrained. The original intent of bringing the head maid Tyra with the Fourth Prince was precisely for this purpose, but unfortunately, he passed away before he could enjoy it. Roland did not favor this practice, so he had given the vacant position to an older, more experienced maid. In fact, this choice was very correct. The castle now housed many witches, but she still managed to keep the inside and outside of the castle in perfect order.

The flames in the fireplace had long been extinguished, leaving only white ash. Gusts of cold wind blew through the cracks of the window behind him, chilling to the bone, making it hard to believe it was still mid-autumn. Roland dried his feet, washed up with another basin of hot water, and went to the window to close the one that had been open all night.

Even though open fireplaces were common in this era, he still worried about carbon monoxide poisoning and always left a gap when he went to sleep. The indoor temperature could be kept warm in the early part of the night, but by dawn, it was no different from outside.

He needed to find a way to solve this problem, Roland thought, otherwise he wouldn't be able to sleep in later.

After breakfast, accompanied by Nightingale, the Chief Knight, and a group of guards, he went for his routine inspection of the city walls.

Between the new and old walls was a large expanse of grassland, now a vast expanse of white. Walking on the thick snow, the soles of his shoes made a crunching sound.

Looking up, the sky was a pale gray, and occasionally a cluster of snowflakes would drift into his neck, bringing a hint of chill. He knew this kind of weather was likely to last until next spring... or even longer.



"How is the defense line holding up?"

"Much better than last time," Carter Lannis looked quite relaxed, "Most of the First Army soldiers have seen battle and are armed with revolving rifles. About a hundred meters of the city wall only needs ten men to guard, and they can suppress the demonic beasts prowling below. Additionally, the new city wall is half a meter taller than the old stone wall, making it difficult for wolf-type demonic beasts to leap directly onto the ramparts. It's practically target practice for the soldiers. As long as no mixed-type demonic beasts appear, these monsters won't be able to cross our defensive line."

"That's good to hear."

Roland ascended the city wall, where soldiers stood tall and saluted him as he passed. Their spirit alone was a stark contrast to the initial militia soldiers. Back then, they appeared uniform as they thrust their wooden spears from atop the wall, but that was merely a conditioned reflex from repeated training. Their eyes were dull, their movements stiff, and upon closer inspection, one would notice most of them trembling slightly.

Now, the soldiers' eyes gleamed with confidence, and after saluting, they promptly returned their gaze to the battlefield to continue their watch.

Walking along the wall toward the side facing the Misty Forest, the scene was much livelier.

The temporary dwellings constructed for the serfs and refugees were arranged in this area. Looking down from the wall, one could see rows of earthen ramps arranged parallel to each other, resembling undulating waves. Each raised ramp contained more than ten rooms, built identically to the cave dwellings. The thick earthen walls retained the interior temperature, and with the heating artifact, the kang bed-stove, one could stay warm with just a burlap cover.

The entire residential area was divided into two sections: the West District near the city wall, designated for the refugees, and the East District further from the wall, allocated to the serfs.

Every day, the City Hall would dispatch people to distribute food and charcoal, while the refugees were required to provide logistical support for the First Army guarding the wall. As for the serfs, most had already saved enough wheat for their needs. Apart from a few enterprising individuals who sought odd jobs to earn extra money, most rarely left the warmth of their homes.



Just then, a fierce argument broke out at the border of the eastern and western districts. Roland followed the noise and saw a crowd gathered in the middle of the main road of the residential area, loudly arguing about something. One of them was wearing a blue and white uniform, seemingly an official from the City Hall. The quarrel quickly escalated into a brawl, with two groups fighting each other, creating chaos at the scene.



"Your Highness?" Carter inquired.



"Let's go have a look," Roland nodded.



The group arrived at the scene of the disturbance, with the Chief Knight charging into the crowd of brawlers, swiftly knocking a few of the most violent ones to the ground. Roland's personal guards also drew their long swords, shouting for everyone to stop, quickly bringing the situation under control.



Upon realizing that the person who had arrived was the lord himself, both groups of people knelt down on the ground.



"What's your name?" Roland asked the official, who had taken a couple of punches to the face, with a frown. "What happened here, who attacked you first?"



"Your Highness, I am Koya Harviss," he cried out, holding his face, "It was that damned refugee who attacked first, the one wearing the brown hemp cloth! I was still distributing food when he pounced on me like a mad dog."



The refugee Koya pointed at looked up and said, "Your Highness, things are not as he says. These people have colluded with the serfs to extort us, charging money for each serving of wheat porridge. When you took us in, you clearly stated that all of this would be distributed for free!"



Roland was slightly surprised; the refugees from the Eastern Region had already been sorted out by the City Hall. Those who were craftsmen, had special skills, or could read were moved to the inner ring. In theory, those left should be ordinary civilians. However, from the way he spoke and the words he used, it didn't seem like something an ordinary civilian could articulate.



In comparison, the town hall member who had cursed with words like "damn" and "mangy dog" was truly disappointing. Having a name and surname... he was likely a knight who had sworn allegiance to Duke Ryan.

"I did indeed say that—before you were formally incorporated into Border Town, the porridge and accommodations are free," Roland repeated in front of all the refugees, "and now, these words still hold true!"

"His Highness is merciful!"

"Long live our lord!"

"Thank you, Your Highness!"

The refugees kowtowed and shouted.

Koya Havis's face instantly turned ashen.

"However, brawling and injuring people within the territory also violates the law, especially attacking a town hall member," Roland signaled to his personal guards, "take all the refugees and serfs who started the fight to the castle, and I will personally judge this brawl."

He paused, then looked interestedly at Koya, "I would also like to ask you about the matter of charging for porridge."
