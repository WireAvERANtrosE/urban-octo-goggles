## I'm sorry, but without additional context or a larger excerpt of the text, I cannot provide a translation. "再飞行" translates to "fly again" or "another flight," but to provide an accurate translation in line with "Release that Witch" by Er Mu, I would need more content to work with. If you have a specific passage or fuller excerpt you would like translated, please provide that, and I will be happy to assist you.
The day after Maggie left, Roland began assembling the new generation of hot air balloons with the witches in the courtyard.



Due to the expansion of the backyard and the Witch Building, Leaf had already moved the plants to the front court. Various types of vines covered the walls, wooden frames, and corridors, giving off a prehistoric forest vibe. The shading effect was also quite evident, as sunlight could only filter through the dense green leaves, leaving scattered patches of light on the ground.



Roland handed a stack of white paper to the witches, asking them to spread it out into a huge canvas. Then, Soraya painted on the lightest layer of blue sky. Compared to the combination of cow gut membrane and canvas used in the first generation hot air balloon, the pure coating fabric was much lighter and extremely tough. The joints had no seams, so no matter how large it was made, there was no fear of disintegrating in the air.



"Lightning mentioned that there might be witches coming from the Fjords?" Wendy asked curiously.



"If everything goes well," Roland repeated the contents of Princess Garcia's reply letter, "we'll have to wait for Tilly Wimbledon's response to know the specifics."



"It seems that Ashes and the others have succeeded," she mused, "So many witches have gathered on Sleeping Island."



"Yes, I'm afraid Tilly has been planning this migration for more than a year or two," Roland said with a shrug, "Not just in Greycastle, but she has also sent witches to secretly contact others in the other three kingdoms. The Witch Union probably received her invitation too. I guess that's why the Royal Guards spread rumors for so long without any witches approaching us—Tilly was simply one step ahead."



"But Cara never mentioned this to us," Wendy said, rubbing her shoulders.



"If she had told you about Tilly's invitation, perhaps you wouldn't have insisted on searching for the Holy Mountain, right?"



"Indeed, that's a possibility. But in that case, we wouldn't have met in Border Town," she said with a smile, shaking her head. "So, you could say... this isn't too bad."



"I think it's quite nice too," Lightning raised her hand.



"Ts, maybe it would have been even better to go to the Fjords," Lily pouted. "After all, it's all witches there, no need to be extra cautious like when you step out in town."



"It's already much better than before," Anna said earnestly. "Back then, I didn't even dare to go out at all."



"That's right, some people are just like that. Ashes flatly refused the last invitation and even put on airs," Miya grumbled. "Claiming she's not a traitor!"



"You..." Lily's eyes widened. "Idiot!"



"Traitor!"



The other witches couldn't help but laugh out loud.



"I feel the same way." Roland felt a sudden surge of immense satisfaction in his heart. Even if he couldn't match the intelligence and agility of the five princesses, nor have the dominance and decisiveness of Timothy and Garcia, at least, he could provide these witches with a free and comfortable living environment and bring a better life to the people under his rule.



"This hot air balloon... I'm afraid it's several times bigger than the last one," Nightingale assessed the part that Soraya had already drawn, "Are you planning to use it to transport witches?"



He nodded, "Only in this way can we avoid the port cities and go directly from the southern end of the town by the sea to within our borders. Besides bringing in new visitors, it's also a new trial."



Once the paper was coated on both sides, it became laminated fabric, each piece nearly six meters in length and width—if it were regular canvas or linen, it would have been difficult to drag with one hand, but for the lightweight coating, it was almost as heavy as a stack of paper. By piecing together more than a dozen pieces of fabric and then using the coating to glue the seams, a giant gasbag of astonishing volume was created.



What Roland wanted to test was the adhesive strength of Soraya's coating. At least when he first saw her new ability, the "thick bark" painted on the table was still fresh in his memory. The two were firmly stuck together, and pulling on the bark could even lift the entire square table. How tightly the coating could adhere to the base layer, whether it could support a huge gasbag, and maintain its firmness and airtightness after inflation, these were all things he wanted to know.



The hot air balloon still relied on Anna for inflation, while the hydrogen balloon could be operated by anyone. Now with the direct current motor, hydrogen gas could be produced by electrolyzing water, and the historically famous Zeppelin airship seemed not far from his reach. As long as he found suitable lightweight framework materials, this giant monster that could fly at altitudes of two to three thousand meters would have almost no natural predators, and its technical difficulty was much lower than that of airplanes.



Although the accuracy of dropping bombs from a kilometer high was quite touching, the enemy could only take hits without the ability to fight back—if they hovered over enemy territory every day, probably any opponent would collapse.



Just imagine, in the future when setting off to the church's Holy City, four or five airships floating side by side in the sky, bombs falling like raindrops, shallow water heavy artillery ships in the river bombarding the enemy's gates and strongholds, and then infantry equipped with repeating rifles waiting in strict formation behind, the coordinated operation of the three-dimensional army of sea, land, and air—it was a little exciting just to imagine.



"Your Highness, what are you grinning about?" Anna sighed, reaching out to cover the corner of his mouth that he couldn't help but curl up.



"Probably fantasizing about those new witches again," Lily rolled her eyes, "Men..."



After the airbag was attached to the huge vine basket with hemp ropes, the new generation hot air balloon was successfully completed. Its volume was nearly four times larger than the first generation, accommodating up to ten members. Above the basket, a sunshade was installed to prevent direct sunlight. Of course, a hole had to be left in the sunshade for Anna to replenish the hot air for the balloon.



Roland named the balloon the Endless, and after completing a load-bearing test in the garden area, it officially embarked on its maiden voyage the following day. The crew members participating in this trial flight included Anna, Wendy, and five other witches, as well as the prince himself.



The entire flight process was very smooth. The witches chattered non-stop in the air, marveling at the spectacular views from a bird's-eye perspective—compared to the previous stationary observation, this moving sightseeing journey obviously piqued everyone's interest even more. Under Wendy's steady wind control, the Endless moved southward, reaching the mountainous region by noon and passing over the peak marked with flags, eventually hovering above the coastline.



After flying around the shallows, the group returned to the castle with the Endless. Roland noticed Wendy, who was responsible for directional control, occasionally pounding her own shoulders, looking very tired.



He had heard that women with larger chests tend to have shoulder aches, and close-fitting underwear was invented to solve this problem, although he had not verified this himself. However, trying it out couldn't hurt. Moreover, as she grew older, Anna's body would also gradually develop, and Roland decided to make a small gift for each adult witch.
