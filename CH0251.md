## Once Again, Flight
The day after Maggie left, Roland began assembling the new generation hot air balloon with the witches in the courtyard.

Since the back garden and the witch dormitory building were being expanded, Leaf had moved the plants to the front yard. Various vines covered the walls, wooden frames, and corridors, creating a prehistoric forest vibe with an obvious shading effect. The sunlight could only filter through the gaps in the dense green leaves, leaving scattered patches of light on the ground.

Roland handed the witches a stack of white paper, asking them to spread it out into a huge canvas on which Soraya would paint the lightest layer of blue sky. Compared to the combination of cow intestine membrane and canvas used in the first generation hot air balloon, the pure coating fabric was much lighter and had excellent toughness. There were no seams at the connections, so no matter how large it was made, there was no fear of it disintegrating in the air.

"Lightning mentioned that there might be witches coming from the Fjords?" Wendy asked curiously.

"If everything goes well," Roland repeated the contents of the letter from Princess Garcia, "we'll have to wait for Tilly Wimbledon's reply for the specifics."

"It seems that Ashes and the others have succeeded," she mused, "So many witches have gathered on Sleeping Island."

"Yes, Tilly has probably been planning this migration for more than a year or two," Roland said with a shrug, "It's not just Greycastle. She has sent witches to secretly contact the other three major kingdoms. The Witch Union must have also received her invitation. I guess that's why the Royal Guards have been spreading rumors for such a long time, but no witches have come to us—Tilly was simply one step ahead."

"But Cara never mentioned this to us," Wendy said, rubbing her shoulders.

"If she had told you about Tilly's invitation, perhaps you wouldn't have insisted on searching for the Holy Mountain, right?"



"There is indeed such a possibility, but if that were the case, we wouldn't have met in Border Town," she said with a smile, shaking her head. "So... this isn't bad either."

"I think it's pretty good too," Lightning raised her hand.

"Tsck, maybe going to the Fjords would be even better," Lily pouted. "After all, it's all witches there, no need to be extra careful like when going out in town."

"It's already much better than before," Anna said earnestly. "Back then, I didn't dare to step outside at all."

"That's right, some people are just like that. Even when Ashes invited them last time, they flat-out refused and still put on airs," Miya grumbled. "And they claim they are not traitors!"

"You..." Lily's eyes widened. "Idiot!"

"Traitor!"

The other witches couldn't help but burst into laughter.

"I feel the same way." Roland felt a sudden surge of fulfillment in his heart. Even if he couldn't match the wit and agility of the five princesses, or the assertiveness and decisiveness of Timothy and Grace, at the very least, he could provide these witches with a free and comfortable living environment, and bring a better life to the people under his rule.



"This hot air balloon... is probably several times bigger than the last one, isn't it?" Nightingale surveyed the section that Soraya had already drawn. "Do you plan to use it to transport witches?"



He nodded. "Only by doing so can we avoid the port cities and go directly from the southern end of the town by the sea to the interior. Besides ferrying new visitors, it is also a new experiment."



After the paper was coated on both sides, it became a layered fabric, each piece nearly six meters in length and width—if it were standard canvas or linen, it would already be difficult to drag with one hand. However, for the lightweight coating, it was almost the same weight as a stack of papers. By stitching together more than a dozen pieces of fabric and using the coating to seal the seams, an enormous gasbag was created.



What Roland wanted to test was the adhesive strength of Soraya's coating. At least when he first saw her new ability, the half-painted "thick bark" on the table was still fresh in his memory. The two were firmly bonded together, and pulling on the bark could even lift the entire square table. How closely the paint could adhere to the base layer, whether it could support a huge gasbag, and maintain its solidity and airtightness after inflation—these were all things he wanted to know.



The hot air balloon still relied on Anna for inflation, but the hydrogen balloon could be operated by anyone. Now with the direct current motor, hydrogen could be produced by electrolyzing water. The historically famous Zeppelin airship seemed not so far out of his reach. As long as he found the right lightweight framework materials, this giant beast that could fly at altitudes of two to three thousand meters would have almost no natural predators, and the technological difficulty was much lower than that of airplanes.



Although the accuracy of dropping bombs from a kilometer in the sky was quite poor, the enemy could only take hits without being able to fight back—if one circled over enemy territory every day, probably any opponent would collapse.



Just imagine, in the future when setting out to the Holy City of the Church, with four or five airships floating side by side in the sky, bombs falling like raindrops, with shallow water heavy artillery ships bombarding the enemy's gates and strongholds from the river, and infantry armed with repeating rifles waiting in strict formation at the rear. Land, sea, and air forces working together in three-dimensional coordinated combat—just imagining it was a bit exciting.



"Your Highness, what are you grinning about again?" Anna sighed and stretched out her hand to cover the corners of his mouth, which had involuntarily curled up.



"Probably daydreaming about those new witches who have arrived," Lily rolled her eyes, "Men..."



After the airbag was connected to the huge vine basket with hemp ropes below, the new generation of hot air balloon was successfully completed. Its volume was nearly four times larger than the first generation, accommodating up to ten people. Above the basket, there was also a sunshade to avoid direct sunlight. Of course, a hole had to be left in the canopy for Anna to replenish the hot air for the balloon.



Roland named the balloon the Lookout, and after completing the equivalent heavy load test on the open ground of the garden area, it officially took off the next day. The crew members participating in this maiden voyage, in addition to Anna, Wendy, and five other witches, included the prince himself.



The entire flight was very smooth, with the witches chattering non-stop in the air, marveling at the spectacular views from a bird's-eye perspective—compared to the last stationary observation, this constantly moving sightseeing trip was obviously more exciting for everyone. Under Wendy's steady wind power, the Lookout moved southward, reaching the mountainous area around noon, crossing over the flag-planted summit, and eventually hovering above the coastline.



After flying around the shallows, the group returned to the castle with the Lookout. Roland noticed that Wendy, who was responsible for directional control, kept beating her shoulders from time to time, looking very tired.



He had heard that women with larger busts tend to have shoulder pain, and that close-fitting underwear was created to address this problem, although he had never verified this claim. However, it wouldn't hurt to try. Moreover, as Anna grew older, her body would also gradually develop, and Roland decided to make a little gift for each adult witch.
