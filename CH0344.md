## The Past (Part 1)
Your Highness?

A peculiar title... It sounded like a term one would only hear in ancient tales.

She tried hard to move her eyes, casting her gaze to the side, only to see a gray-haired man entering her field of vision, accompanied by several women.

"How do you feel?" he asked in a low voice.

"..." She didn't answer, instead asking back, "Where is this?"

"The western border of the Kingdom of Greycastle, Border Town."

Great, things were progressing in the direction she least wanted—unknown location, unknown time, unknown people. She tried to turn over and get out of bed, only to find her body utterly devoid of strength.

"I am the fourth prince of the Kingdom of Greycastle, the lord of Border Town, Roland Wimbledon," he continued, "All these ladies are members of the Witch Union. Do you... not remember anything?"

The Witch Union? She frowned. They were witches? Although she had no idea what this new organization was, at least they were her kin. But... why did they seem like subordinates to this man?



Wait, prince?

She recalled for a moment, and couldn't help but be stunned. Wasn't that the title of the secular regime during the first Battle of Divine Will more than four hundred years ago? Could it be... she had returned to before the war had begun? Could it be that the gods had given her a chance to start over, allowing her to prepare in advance to save the Holy City and its people?

No, calm down, she told herself, such unreasonable things only happen in fictional tavern tales. Right, what was the last thing she encountered? In the basement of the experimental building, a group of frenzied demons rushed in, and she released all her magic power, constructing the most solid barrier of ice. The echo magic stone kept releasing distress signals, waiting for the day they returned to the Fertile Plains, hoping to be discovered once again.

"Was it you who saved me?" Yes, now that she had emerged from the ice barrier, it could only mean that the witch army had come back! "Have the devils retreated? Did we win? What about the Holy City... What about the City of Taquila?"

After blurting out a series of questions, she saw the expressions of several people change, looking at each other, showing looks of joy and excitement. A witch with a more mature appearance and auburn hair couldn't help but ask, "We indeed found you in the basement of a stone tower, are you really someone from four hundred and fifty years ago?"

The questioner reminded her of that valiant Blessed Warrior who had turned the tide, whose hair was also like this, illuminating people's hearts like flames. She preferred to answer the witch's question over the gray-haired man, although she usually didn't care much about status, being stared at and questioned by inferiors always felt offensive.

If it were a more fastidious master, this man would likely face severe punishment.

"My name is Agatha, a witch of the Taquila Explorers Association," she paused, "What do you mean by four hundred and fifty years ago, could it be... you've been fighting the devils for over four hundred years? That's impossible."

"You've slept for too long, and things might be a little different from what you think," the man who called himself Roland said, "If you feel well, we can explain it to you slowly."



"Speak," Agatha closed her eyes and took a deep breath. Although the prince was being incredibly rude, she didn't have the luxury to fuss over it now.



As he began to elaborate on the history of Greycastle and the evolution of the four major kingdoms of the continent, she felt a cold sweat breaking out on her back. In his narration, Agatha quickly found several corresponding landmarks—such as the Misty Forest, the Impassable Mountain Range... But when she fitted these landmarks into her memory, the conclusions she drew were incredibly shocking.



If the place names matched, then the so-called four major kingdoms were nothing more than the barbaric lands of old—a narrow strip of land sandwiched between the mountains and the sea, which in their eyes was a barren land with no value for development. And what he referred to as the barbaric forbidden zone, was actually the fertile plains she was familiar with. As for the Holy City of Taquila, it had long since become a place unknown to anyone, buried deep in the fertile plains over the long passage of time.



How ridiculous was that?



But what was even more laughable came later.



Buried along with Taquila was the status of the witches—in his words, witches had become objects of persecution and humiliation, in the four major kingdoms, the power was firmly held by ordinary people, who called themselves kings and nobles, it was the same old tune from before the first Battle of Divine Will.



And yet it was these antiques who had become the rulers stepping on the heads of witches.



How could this be possible?



"How dare you!" she couldn't help but interrupt angrily, "Witches being hunted by ordinary people? Who would have the guts to do such a thing?"

Agatha tried to summon her magic to teach this nonsense-spouting man a lesson, but to her astonishment, her power wouldn't turn into frost as usual. It was then that she felt a metal ring around her ankle. Lifting the blanket, she saw that it was embedded with a Divine Stone of Judgement.

"Have you all gone mad!?" she looked incredulously at the group of witches, "To help a common man against a high-order awakened and even violate the Union's decree by using the Divine Stone of Judgement unauthorized!"

Only the enforcement teams of the Union were allowed to use the Divine Stones, and anyone else who carried, sold, modified, or destroyed them would be subject to the severest of sanctions, possibly even the death penalty.

The prince sighed, "This was what I was worried about."

"Don't worry, I'll talk to her," the red-haired witch sat down by the bed, covering her with the blanket again, "My name is Wendy, things are not as you think, and what he said is true... I don't know what the Holy City you lived in 450 years ago was like, but now, Taquila no longer exists, and we've never heard of your Union. We've been living a life of hiding until we met Prince Roland."

"He has given us a safe place to live and encourages us to use our abilities while researching how we can better use them to transform the world. Here, we can live freely like ordinary people, without hiding or worrying about being pursued and hunted by the Church or the populace. You should know that now, the Divine Stone of Judgement is everywhere, and after a witch loses her powers, she is not much stronger than an ordinary person."

After hearing Wendy's explanation, Agatha fell completely silent.



The Federation is a massive organization established by several witch kingdoms, possessing numerous high-ranking witches and extraordinary individuals. In order to win the Battle of Divine Will, they consolidated their power and formed an extremely large army, also bringing all the Holy Cities under their control, responsible for training and dispatching witches, resolving disputes, and maintaining urban stability and order. Only they had the authority to capture and judge a witch... Yet such a powerful organization is now unheard of...



Where are those refugees who wanted to rebuild order? Where are they now?
