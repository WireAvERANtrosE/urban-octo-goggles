## The War of Mortals (Part 1)
Seeing this scene, another captive turned and fled backwards, which made Jiera look somewhat disappointed. She transformed into a wisp of ghostly light and plunged into the captive's body, causing him to immediately stop in his tracks, eyes rolling back as his body underwent a strange transformation—Maine had seen such a scene more than once, but no matter how many times he witnessed it, he couldn't help but feel a chill rise in his heart.



A dim light burst forth from within the captive, his body twisted and deformed until it finally took on the appearance of a Pure Witch. He knew this was not a simple substitution or killing, but what exactly happened during the transformation was probably only understood by the Pope and the person involved.



Taking a deep breath, Jiera walked back to the last captive. He was the youngest of the three captured scouts, probably only fourteen or fifteen years old, his somewhat tender eyes filled with shock and fear, as if he could not believe what had just happened.



"Now, only you remain," she said softly. "Ayr."



Hearing her words, the boy who was originally trembling in an attempt to pick up the scimitar suddenly froze, "Wh-why..."



"The gods have told me everything. You were originally just a child from a farming family on the outskirts, but because of the Wolf King's orders, everyone in the village was forcibly moved into the city, burdened with labor such as repairing the walls, making military supplies, and transporting grain. They did not spare you because of your young age; instead, they conscripted you into the scouting team, where in reality you were left to your own devices," she said, reaching out to caress his cheek, "The best evidence is that when you first sent back intelligence about the church's army movements, the captain of the guard didn't even let you through the city gate, but listened to your report and then had you continue to track us, right?"



"I..." Ayr opened his mouth but was unable to utter a single word.



"Of course they won't let you in, because your family no longer exists. Whether it's your parents or siblings, they are all just consumables for the Wolf King. If you were to go back, wouldn't that cause the entire scout team to know?" Gerald continued, "Your father died by accident when he fell while repairing a breach in the city wall. Your mother went to the overseers but was flogged and is now hanging by a thread. Without any divine oversight, the evils of this world flow unchecked like sewage. Are you sure you want to serve such a ruler?"



He couldn't help but widen his eyes, his face showing uncontrollable grief, "This... it can't be, you're lying to me!"



"The gods never lie," the Pure One shook her head, "You know in your heart that everything I've said is true. The root of all this lies in the fact that the nobles have never treated you as their equals, but rather as livestock for their taking. What we must do is to end all this evil and injustice, to establish a new world under the watch and supervision of the gods."



Ayr fell to his knees with a thud, burying his head and weeping, "What... what should I do?"



"Follow your heart, only the gods can judge," she said with a choke.



"I was wrong, I'm willing to tell you everything I know, as long as it can save my mother, I'm willing to do anything."



"There, there, child," Gerald patted his head and took out a plant with slender leaves from her pocket, handing it to him, "Eat this and get a good night's sleep. It will help stabilize your emotions," she tore off half a leaf and began to chew it, "Just like this. When Wolfsheart City falls tomorrow, perhaps you will be able to see your mother again."



Main frowned, the plant was indeed used to prepare the Dream Water, a Sleepy Fern, which had no effect when consumed by a witch, but was a potent poison for ordinary people, and had to be neutralized with the poison of Winterflower. As expected, after the captive ate it, his face turned a deathly pale. He clutched his throat, looking disbelievingly at Gerald, who wore a smile, making harsh gasping sounds. Soon his fingernails broke through his skin and blood vessels, splattering blood that dyed his neck bright red. After struggling in agony for a short while, his body gradually went limp, and he stopped breathing.



"It's a pity, the gods have not forgiven your sins." Jelor curled her lips, walking in front of the archbishop, bowed and said, "Your Excellency, how do you find this trial? Does it have the grace of Lord Hesse?"



"Why did you deceive him into consuming the sleeping fern?" Mayne asked in a deep voice, "If it were Hesse, we would have gained a devout believer instead of executing him after he realized his error."



"If the prisoner's family were truly as I described, we could indeed recruit them as believers. Unfortunately, I do not know the true situation of his parents; those were all lies I made up on the spot." She shrugged indifferently, "Once he finds out they're all lies, it's obviously not good for the church. Believe me, I am wholeheartedly serving the church."



"If you were truly wholehearted, you should have stayed in the tent waiting for orders," Mayne said, turning his head impatiently, "The attack is about to start; you all prepare immediately. According to the plan, the Wolf King and Queen Clearwater—"



"Must die, Your Excellency," the Purifier said with a smile, "If it were just me, I might not be able to do it, but since Isabella is here too, they definitely can't escape the heart of the wolf."



...

"Woo—woo—"

The horn for the attack rolled across the sky, and amidst the oppressive dark clouds and rustling autumn wind, the second siege battle began.



Far away, two miles off, the 'siege beast' used for launching iron spears bloomed with the glow of magic on its support frame. When the light shone as bright as the blazing sun, the iron spears were as if hurled by a giant's hand, bursting forth with a deafening roar in an instant, and shooting out at a speed indiscernible to the naked eye, flying straight toward the city walls.



Crossing such a vast distance, its might was not diminished in the slightest; the snow stone-built city walls were utterly incapable of stopping it—it easily shattered the obstructing stones into powder, and even the militia crouching behind the walls suffered the consequences. With just three rounds of shooting, the city gate was completely destroyed, and the nearby walls were also severely damaged.



The siege engine from the devils, though with a firing speed comparable to a trebuchet, had a range many times greater. Under such an onslaught, the defensive troops were completely incapable of counterattacking. Since they could not see the trajectory of the shots, they didn't even know where the next attack would land. The church's army had not yet mobilized, and the outer defenses were already in peril.



Just then, a thunderous noise suddenly came from behind the city walls!



A huge fireball soared into the sky, and everyone felt the ground shake beneath their feet. Accompanied by flames and black smoke, this section of the stone wall collapsed with a loud rumble, and the mottled wolf's teeth finally showed a breach.



The urgent sound of the horn blew once more, and the mixed troops composed of the Judgement Army and the God's Punishment Army began to charge towards the city wall. From a distance, it looked like a flowing sea of gold and crimson, and any who dared to stand in their way would be ruthlessly devoured.



Now, the Wolfheart's defense forces had to confront these warriors, who did not belong to the mortal realm, with their own flesh and blood.
