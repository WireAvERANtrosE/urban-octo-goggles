## The War of the Mortals (Part 1)
Seeing this scene, another captive turned to escape, which made Jiera somewhat disappointed.

She transformed into a wisp of ghostly light, darting into the captive's body, who immediately stopped in his tracks, his eyes rolling back as his body underwent a strange transformation—a scene that Maine had seen more than once, but no matter how many times he saw it, he couldn't help but feel a chill rise in his heart.

A dim light burst out from within the captive's body, and as it twisted and deformed, it eventually took the shape of a Pure Witch.

He knew that this was not a simple replacement or killing; however, what exactly happened during the transformation process was likely only understood by the Pope and the person involved.

Jiera took a deep breath and walked back to the last captive.

He was the youngest of the three captured scouts, probably only fourteen or fifteen years old, with a slightly immature look in his eyes full of shock and fear, as if he couldn't believe what had just happened.

"Now, only you are left," she said softly, "Ayr."

Hearing these words, the boy who was originally trembling and trying to pick up his scimitar suddenly froze, "Wh-why..."

"The gods have told me everything. You were originally just a child from a farmer's family on the outskirts, but due to the Wolf King's command, everyone in the village was forcibly moved into the city, burdened with the labor of repairing walls, making military supplies, and transporting grain. They didn't spare you because of your young age but conscripted you into the scout team, where in reality, you were left to fend for yourselves," she reached out and caressed his cheek, "The best proof is that when you first sent back intelligence about the church's army movements, the captain of the guards didn't even let you into the city gate but listened to your report and then had you continue to track us, right?"



"I..." Air stuttered, opening his mouth but unable to utter a single word.



"Of course they won't let you in, because your family no longer exists. Your parents, your siblings, they're just like you, mere expendables to the Wolf King. If you were to go back, wouldn't that stir up the scouting team?" Jelor continued, "Your father fell to his death while repairing a breach in the wall, and your mother, after seeking the overseers, was whipped and is now hanging by a thread. Without the gods' oversight, the evil of the world flows unchecked like sewage. Are you sure you want to serve such rulers?"



He couldn't help but widen his eyes, a look of irrepressible sorrow crossing his face, "This... it can't be, you're lying to me!"



"The gods never lie," the Purifier shook her head, "Deep down, you also know that everything I say is true. The root of all this lies in the fact that the nobles have never considered you as one of their own, merely livestock for their taking. What we aim to do is to put an end to all this evil and injustice, to establish a new world under the watchful eyes of the gods."



Air fell to his knees with a thud, burying his head as he wept bitterly, "What should I do?"



"Follow your heart, only the gods can judge," she said.



Choking with sobs, he said, "I was wrong, I am willing to tell you everything I know, as long as it can save my mother, I am willing to do anything."



"Good boy," Jelor patted his head and pulled out a plant with long slender leaves from her pocket, handing it to him, "Eat this and have a good sleep. It will help stabilize your emotions," she tore off half a leaf, chewed it in her mouth, "just like this. When Wolfheart City is breached tomorrow, perhaps you will be able to see your mother again."



Mayne frowned, the plant was the very one used to concoct Dream Water, a sleeping fern. Witches eating it raw had no effect, but for ordinary people, it was an extremely potent poison that needed to be neutralized with winterflower. Sure enough, not long after the captive consumed it, his face turned a ghastly shade of blue. He clutched at his throat, looking incredulously at Jelor who was smiling, a raspy gasp escaping his throat. Soon, his nails broke the skin and blood vessels, splashing blood around his neck, staining it crimson. After half a minute of painful struggling, his body gradually went limp and he stopped breathing.



"It's a pity that the gods have not forgiven your sins," Jelo curled her lips, walked in front of the archbishop, and bowed, "My lord, what do you think of this trial? Does it have the grace of His Excellency Hesser?"

"Why did you deceive him into taking the sleeping fern?" Maine asked in a deep voice, "If it were Hesser, we would have gained a devout believer instead of having him repent and then executing him."

"If the prisoner's family is really as I said, naturally they could be recruited as believers, but unfortunately, I do not know the true situation of his parents; those were all lies I made up on the spot." She shrugged indifferently, "Once he finds out all of these are lies, it's obviously not good for the church. Believe me, I am wholeheartedly devoted to the church."

"If you were wholeheartedly devoted, you should have stayed in the tent awaiting orders," Maine turned away impatiently, "The attack is about to begin, get ready immediately, according to the plan, the Wolf King and Queen of Clearwater—"

"Must die, my lord," the Purifier smiled, "If it were just me alone, I might not be able to do it, but now that Isabella is here as well, they can't escape from the Wolf's Heart."

...

"Wu— Wu—"

The attack horn rolled across the sky, and amidst the pressing dark clouds and rustling autumn wind, the second siege battle began.

Far away, two miles off, the 'Siege Beast,' the structure used to launch iron spears, blossomed with the light of magic. When the light shone as bright as the blazing sun, the iron spear was cast out as if by the hand of a giant, bursting forth with a deafening boom in an instant, shooting out at a speed difficult for the naked eye to discern, flying straight toward the city wall.



Crossing such a vast distance, its power was not diminished in the slightest. The city walls made of snow rock could not block it at all—it easily turned the obstructive stones into powder, and even the militia crouched behind the walls suffered the consequences. After only three rounds of shooting, the city gate was completely shattered, and the nearby walls were also severely damaged.



Although the devil's siege weapon fired at a speed comparable to that of a trebuchet, its range was many times greater. Under such an offensive, the defending troops were powerless to counterattack. Since they couldn't see the trajectory of the projectiles, they didn't even know where the next attack would land. The church's army had not yet moved, but the outer defense line was already in dire straits.



Just then, a thunderous boom suddenly came from behind the city walls!



A huge fireball soared into the sky, and everyone felt the ground shake beneath their feet. Accompanied by flames and black smoke, that section of the stone wall collapsed with a roar, finally revealing a gap in the once unblemished wolf's teeth.



The urgent sound of the horn blew once again, and the mixed troops of the Judgement Army and the God's Punishment Army began to charge toward the city walls. From afar, they looked like a flowing sea of gold and crimson. Anyone who dared to stand in their way would be mercilessly engulfed by them.



Now, the Wolfheart Guard must use their own flesh and blood to confront these warriors not of this world.
