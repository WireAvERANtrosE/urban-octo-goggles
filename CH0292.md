## Precision Guided Bomb
The training ground for handgun shooting was arranged in the front courtyard of the castle.

Including Sylvie, all the witches who had been selected for the scout team received a revolver.

After spending two days getting everyone familiar with and mastering the proper gun-holding posture, Roland moved on to live-fire training. The main content was divided between 10-meter precision shooting and 5-meter rapid firing to prepare them for both well-prepared engagements and surprise attacks.

The witches looked quite professional during the gun-holding practice, but their true colors showed when it came time to shoot.

Especially when the deafening gunfire sounded, the first thing most of them did was cover their ears, which made Nightingale raise her eyebrows.

Except for Anna.

She held the gun steadily in both hands and continuously pulled the trigger, completely ignoring the noise and the gun smoke. Regardless of her accuracy, her movements alone were clean and crisp.

Could it be that in addition to learning knowledge, Anna was also extremely talented in other areas? Roland was secretly surprised. However, considering it was a large-caliber revolver, even using black powder bullets, it had significant recoil, so why didn't her arms move at all during continuous firing?

Curious, he walked up behind her and saw two lumps of black powder clinging tightly to the grip, holding it firmly in the air, while Anna merely made the gesture of holding it, without actually touching the handgun. He patted her shoulder, and she pulled the black powder from her ears that she had used as earplugs, with an expression that screamed 'come and praise me', "How about that, I hit all the targets!"



Roland couldn't help but cry and laugh. He then loudly declared, "No one is allowed to use their abilities to assist in practice!"



"Eh, why?"



"If we encounter an enemy with the Divine Stone of Judgement, wouldn't we be all flustered?" Roland sighed, reached out, and stuffed Anna's ears, "There, you shouldn't be afraid now."



"Mhm!" Her bright eyes were full of laughter as she changed the bullet and aimed the gun again.



"Maggie, come here, I need to plug my ears too," Lightning called out enviously.



"Goo?" The latter pointed to the gun in her hands.



"You can't shoot after you turn into a bird anyway," the little girl hinted with her eyes, "You plug my ears first, then I'll help you later."



"Goo!"



The other witches in the castle were also attracted by the continuous gunfire and gradually gathered in the castle's front courtyard, many with an eager look on their faces. In the end, almost everyone had a go at experiencing the operation of the firearms.



Seeing a group of colorful women happily handling their weapons, Roland was filled with emotion.

He still remembered the appearance of each witch when he first met them.

Anna was once so thin and frail, like a bamboo pole, with lifeless eyes and a constant expression on her face;

Nightingale always had a hint of gloom between her brows, her smile unrelated to her emotions, or rather, it was to conceal her feelings, always with a playful smile on her lips;

And Wendy, with her soft and gentle voice that could not hide her fatigue, Leaves who resigned to fate and confusion when betting her future on a single throw, and Lily, as wary as a cat;

There were Lightning, Miya, Hummingbird, Scroll, and many others...

After enduring oppression, framing, and hunting, surviving was a stroke of luck, and there was no time to think about what would come next. But now, they were completely different from their past selves.

The witches radiated a unique charm, their eyes sparkling with vitality, and the future was no longer a mystery to them—beyond just surviving, they now had the strength to pursue other things, things as beautiful as life itself.

And whenever Roland saw the gratitude and trust in the witches' eyes as they looked at him, he felt a surge of power in his heart.



After lunch, the afternoon was reserved for the high-altitude bombing practice specifically designed for the "Autumn Offensive." The number of witches participating in the drill had significantly decreased, leaving only Anna, Wendy, and Lightning.

These three were also the minimum number required to carry out an air raid.

Setting the attack for the beginning of the second month of autumn was the result of Roland's careful deliberation. If the time was too short, he wouldn't be able to make all the necessary preparations; if it was too late, it might not serve to deter Timothy from dispatching his troops. If Timothy was determined to launch a large-scale assault on the Western Territory and forced the drugs on the conscripted civilians, the air raid would not achieve the intended effect.

Therefore, the Autumn Offensive had to begin before he had finished his full conscription.

To fulfill his "promise," Roland planned to drop a 250-kilogram bomb right above the Greycastle royal palace. This bomb, equivalent to the weight of five Nightingales, would be dropped from an altitude of two kilometers, piercing directly through the dome of the palace and detonating inside.

As the hot air balloon slowly ascended, the large basket carrying the solid simulation bomb rose into the sky. Since Roland was also on board the basket, the solid iron bomb had to be slightly smaller in size, about the weight of four Nightingales. However, its design was identical to the aerial bombs that would be used in actual combat, featuring a streamlined shell that was thicker at the front and tapered at the rear, with stabilizing tail fins and a deceleration parachute to ensure that it remained vertical to the ground during descent and to control its maximum falling speed.

The bomb basket had also been specially modified, with an iron frame installed so that the bomb stood vertically in the center of the basket, half protruding from the bottom. By pulling up the valve, the hook claw mechanism would be released, allowing the bomb to detach from the basket and plummet straight down.

As the altitude continued to rise, Border Town quickly shrank to the size of a fingernail, and the Redwater River turned into a shimmering silver ribbon.



"It's my first time standing at such a high place," Wendy peered out of the lookout window, "the whole Western Region seems so small from up here."

"Because it is small," Roland chuckled, "look at the barbaric lands to the north, that's where we should be heading in the future."

"Do we have to go higher? I can hardly see the target anymore," Lightning shouted from outside the basket.

"That should be about high enough." He nodded to Anna, then made a ready gesture to the little girl.

Although it was impossible to judge exactly how far above the ground they were at that moment, they must have been over a thousand meters up—at such a height, launching an attack was absolutely safe, and the enemy would also be unable to observe the movements of the hot air balloon.

However, an airdrop from a distance of more than a thousand meters meant that hitting the target was entirely up to chance. To strike the target precisely, the bomb needed a guidance system.

And the little girl, Lightning, would undertake this task.

"Drop the bomb," Roland ordered.

Wendy pulled the valve, releasing the bomb, and the air surged into the basket. Anna quickly sealed the bomb drop hole with a cover plate she had prepared earlier and tightened the fixing bracket—these procedures had been practiced repeatedly on land, and the two worked together seamlessly.



"Can she hit the target?" Wendy asked, leaning over the window.



"We'll only know the answer when we go down," Roland shrugged.



In the process of the bomb falling, Lightning will fall at the same speed as it, applying horizontal thrust to the bomb, allowing it to freely change its trajectory, thus becoming a guided missile. As it approaches the target, Lightning will then pull on the tail mechanism, causing the parachute to separate from the bomb. The bomb will gain sufficient kinetic energy in the last few hundred meters, until it penetrates the palace's roof.



In this way, a sufficiently high drop distance actually ensures precise control over the landing point.



What remains is simply to practice this process over and over again.
