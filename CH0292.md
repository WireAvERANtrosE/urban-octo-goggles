## Precision-guided bomb
The training location for pistol shooting was arranged in the castle's front courtyard.

Including Sylvie, all the witches selected for the scouting team received a revolver.

Roland spent two days familiarizing everyone with the posture of holding a gun, after which the training moved on to live ammunition shooting. The main content was divided into ten-meter aiming shooting and five-meter rapid firing, to prepare for both planned combat and surprise attacks.

The witches looked quite professional during the pistol-holding practice, but their true colors showed when it came to firing.

Especially when the deafening gunshots rang out, the first thing most did was to cover their ears, which made Nightingale raise her eyebrows.

Except for Anna.

She held the gun steady in both hands, continuously pulling the trigger, completely ignoring the gunshots and the smoke. Regardless of her accuracy, her movements alone were crisp and clean.

Could it be that besides learning knowledge, Anna also possessed exceptional talent in other aspects? Roland wondered in surprise. However, considering the large-caliber revolver, even when using black powder bullets, it had a significant recoil. So why didn’t her arms move at all during continuous firing?

Out of curiosity, he walked behind her, only to see two clumps of black fire clinging tightly to the grip, firmly holding it in mid-air, while Anna was merely making an empty grip gesture, not touching the gun at all. After he tapped her on the shoulder, she pulled out the black fire she had been using as earplugs and turned around with a face that seemed to say 'come praise me', "How about that, I hit all the targets!"



Roland couldn't help but laugh and cry at the same time, and he had to announce loudly, "No one is allowed to use their abilities to assist in practice!"



"Eh, why?"



"If we encounter an enemy with God's Punishment Stones, won't we be in a mess?" Roland sighed, reached out to help Anna plug her ears, "Now you shouldn't be scared."



"Mm!" Her bright eyes were filled with smiles, and after reloading, she raised her gun to aim again.



"Maggie, come here, I need to plug my ears too," Lightning called out enviously.



"Goo?" The latter pointed to the gun in her hand.



"You can't shoot anyway after you turn into a bird," the little girl hinted with a gesture, "You help me plug first, and then I'll help you later."



"Goo!"



The other witches in the castle were also attracted by the continuous gunfire and gradually gathered in the castle's front yard, with many showing an eager expression. In the end, almost everyone had a turn experiencing the operation of firearms.



Seeing a group of colorful women enthusiastically fiddling with the weapons in their hands, Roland felt deeply moved.



Even now, he still remembered what each witch looked like when he first met them.

Anna used to be so thin and weak that she resembled a bamboo pole, with lifeless eyes and a perpetual expression on her face;

Nightingale always had a hint of gloom between her brows, her smile unrelated to her emotions, or rather, it was to conceal her feelings, always keeping a teasing smile on her lips;

And there was Wendy's soft and gentle voice that couldn't hide her fatigue, Leaves' resignation and confusion when she put her future at stake, and Lily, who was as wary as a cat;

There were also Lightning, Maggie, Hummingbird, Scroll, and so on...

After going through oppression, framing, and hunting, it was a stroke of luck to survive at all, let alone think about where they were heading. But now, they were completely different from their past selves.

The witches radiated a unique charm, their eyes sparkling with life, and the future was no longer a mystery to them—they had more than just survival; they could pursue other things, things as beautiful as life itself.

And whenever Roland saw the gratitude and trust in the eyes of the witches when they looked at him, he felt filled with strength.



After lunch, the afternoon was time for the high-altitude bombing practice specially devised for the "Autumn Offensive." The number of witches participating in the drill had decreased significantly, leaving only Anna, Wendy, and Lightning.

This was also the minimum number of people needed to complete an air raid.

Setting the attack time at the beginning of the second month of autumn was the result of Roland's careful consideration. If the time was too short, he could not make full preparations; too late, and it might not play a role in deterring Timothy from sending out his troops—if Timothy was determined to launch a large-scale offensive against the Western Territory and feed the medicine to those conscripted civilians, the air raid would not achieve the desired effect.

Therefore, the Autumn Offensive must begin before he had completely finished the conscription.

To fulfill his "promise," Roland planned to drop a 250-kilogram bomb directly over the palace of Greycastle. This bomb, equivalent to the weight of five Nightingales, would be dropped from an altitude of two kilometers, piercing directly through the dome of the palace and detonating inside.

As the hot-air balloon slowly ascended, the large basket carried a solid mock shell into the sky—since Roland was also in the basket, the mock shell was one size smaller, probably weighing about four Nightingales. However, its design was identical to the aerial bombs that would be used in actual combat, featuring a streamlined shell that was thicker at the front and tapered towards the back, with a stabilizing tail fin and a drag parachute to ensure it would always fall vertically to the ground and control its maximum falling speed.

The bombing basket had also been specially modified, with an iron frame installed so that the bomb stood vertically in the center of the basket, half protruding from the bottom. Simply pulling the valve would trigger the hook mechanism to release, and the bomb would detach from the basket, plummeting straight down.

As the altitude continued to rise, Border Town quickly shrank to the size of a fingernail, and the Redwater River turned into a shimmering silver ribbon.



"I am standing at such a high place for the first time," Wendy peered out through the lookout window, "It feels like the whole Western Region has become so narrow."

"Because it is narrow," Roland said with a light chuckle, "Look at the barbaric lands to the north, that's where we should be heading to in the future."

"Do we have to ascend further? I can hardly see the target anymore," Lightning shouted from outside the hanging basket.

"That should be enough." He nodded at Anna, then gave the little girl a ready signal.

Although it was not possible to judge how far from the ground they were at this moment, there must have been over a thousand meters—launching an attack from this height was absolutely safe, and the enemy could not observe the movements of the hot air balloon.

However, a drop distance of over a thousand meters meant that hitting the target was entirely up to chance; to precisely hit the target, the bomb would need a guidance system.

And the little girl, Lightning, would undertake this task.

"Drop the bomb," Roland ordered.

Wendy pulled the valve, and the bomb was dropped, with air rushing into the basket immediately. Anna sealed the drop hole with the cover that had been prepared in advance and tightened the fixing brackets—all these procedures had been repeatedly practiced on land, and the two worked together in perfect harmony.



"Can she hit the target?" Wendy asked, leaning out of the window.



"We'll only know the answer to that once we go down," Roland shrugged.



During the bomb's fall, Lightning will descend at the same speed and apply horizontal thrust to it, allowing the bomb to freely change its trajectory, turning it into a guided missile. When it is close to the target, Lightning will then pull the mechanism at the tail, causing the parachute to separate from the bomb body. The bomb will gain sufficient kinetic energy in the last few hundred meters, enough to penetrate the palace's roof.



In this way, a sufficiently high drop distance actually becomes the guarantee for precise control of the landing point.



The rest is just a matter of practicing this process over and over.
