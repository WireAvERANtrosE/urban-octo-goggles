## Lecture
After the first rain of winter finally fell, it lasted for two days.

Roland leaned on his desk, looking out at the hazy town through the window. The rain, carried by the wind, struck the glass in waves, creating ripples that distorted the outlines of the town. Under the ripples' refraction, the contours of houses and streets twisted and deformed, losing their usual neatness. Due to the lack of effective drainage, water flowed across the cobblestone streets, forming many shimmering streams at a distance.

The distant mountains and forests were shrouded in mist, appearing and disappearing like a mystical realm.



Such a scene, if placed in modern times, would surely be a tourist hotspot, but now Roland wished to see a jungle of steel and concrete instead. The wall construction had to be halted due to the rain, slightly dampening his joy from successfully "persuading" the fortress messenger the other day.



"The air around us is composed of many different gases, is that true?" Anna's clear voice interrupted Roland's thoughts as she asked with her beautiful blue eyes.



"Cough, Miss Anna, you should use honorifics when addressing His Highness," the Chief Knight reminded from the side.



"No need to be so formal," Roland turned around, "she is now my student." He had called the two witches and Carter over for a lesson during the rain—an idea inspired by the stonemason Karl's initiative to start a school. If even a stonemason could open a school, why couldn't he, a proud engineering graduate? Discrimination arises from ignorance, after all. Universal education is always the most effective way to advance civilization in any era.



He had originally wanted to invite the minister's assistants as well, but due to their recent preoccupation with governmental affairs, they had politely declined. For some reason, Roland felt that since winter began, Barov had been particularly motivated, almost single-handedly managing the daily affairs of Border Town.



Anna's eyes lit up with the prospect of learning new knowledge. Nana was happy not to have to heal various experimental animals, and Carter came with the attitude of idly listening in, as if to say, "I'm free anyway, might as well join in your folly."



However, not long into the lesson, the knight's gaze began to wander. Nana also looked bewildered, staring blankly at the words 'nature' and 'science'. Anna seemed to half understand, but still tried hard to remember everything she heard. Roland had to pause and let the three digest the information for a moment.



To Anna's question, he smiled and nodded, "Of course, even though they look the same."



"Your Highness, I don't understand, if they all look the same, how do you know they are different gases?" Carter expressed his skepticism.



"I can demonstrate it to you."



Roland knew that if he only used words to explain, most people would be confused by these seemingly profound theories. He decided to conduct a simple experiment to spark everyone's interest.



A candle, a glass cup, a wooden basin, and a bowl of clear lime water—these were the items he had prepared in advance. Although the glass cup was a light brown color, far less transparent than a beaker from later times, it was still sufficient for the task. After all, this simple experiment didn't require observing the process of change.



Roland had already done a preliminary experiment, and the results proved that although this world contained magic power, other natural rules were still the same as those on Earth. He had Anna light a candle and then stand it in a wooden basin.

"Burning consumes a kind of gas, which is also closely related to all life. If we stop breathing, we will end up like this candle. Watch closely." Roland placed a glass over the candle; the flame flickered twice and soon went out.

"It has exhausted the air, Your Highness. It's not surprising," the Chief Knight said dismissively, "Of course we would die without air, like if we fell into water."

Nana nodded repeatedly.

"So, do you think there is nothing left in the glass?" Roland asked as he poured lime water into the wooden basin. The waterline quickly submerged the mouth of the glass and finally stopped halfway up the glass.

This experiment was so classic that most elementary school teachers liked to use it as an introductory experiment for their natural science classes. Roland still remembered the shock he felt when his teacher demonstrated and explained it on the desk, which set him on the irreversible path of science and engineering.

He gently lifted a corner of the glass, and a few bubbles instantly escaped from the mouth of the glass and rose to the surface.

Then, the clear lime water became slightly cloudy, and a small amount of white sediment slowly spread out from the mouth of the glass.

"If there was nothing in the glass, we wouldn't see the bubbles and the change in the water's surface. This indicates that there are at least two different gases in the air. In fact, the candle only consumes part of the air, while the other part cannot be involved in burning. Although it is colorless and odorless like the former, its properties are completely opposite."

"It seems... it seems that's the case," Carter took a while to understand the relationship, "But what's the use of knowing this?"

"If we can obtain the first kind of gas, we can make the flame burn longer, and likewise, if we obtain the second kind of gas, we can extinguish the flame quickly!" Anna suddenly spoke up.

She's a genius, Roland thought to himself. Although there was a small mistake, the ability to immediately think of separating and purifying based on the different properties of the gases was absolutely genius-level thinking. Keep in mind she had never received any systematic modern education, and to quickly come to this point was enough to show her logical ability was extraordinary—at least far superior to his own Chief Knight.

"Well said, since humans learned to use fire, they have separated from animals, and it all started from an accident. Perhaps lightning ignited the trees, or maybe sparks from striking stones caused the flames. But if no one noticed this, if no one tried to utilize it, we would still be like beasts today," he persuaded gently, "This experiment is to tell you that curiosity and thinking are the driving forces of human progress. There are many such latent forces in nature, just waiting for us to discover and utilize them."

After he finished speaking, Carter still looked half-convinced, while Nana belonged to the type who was impressed but didn't fully understand, staring blankly at Roland. Only Anna lowered her head, as if pondering something.

Well, Roland sighed, indeed, overly advanced ideas would not bring shock, but would only make people feel confused. The height of their thoughts meant they could not understand the power of such forces, and only when tangible objects were truly placed in front of them would they realize how miraculous the latent forces in nature could be.

At that moment, the kettle hanging on the fireplace rack began to clatter, the sound of steam striking the lid.



"Ah, the water is boiling." The knight went over to use a fork to take out the kettle, and the noise quickly ceased. He wrapped the handle with a cloth and lifted the kettle to fill everyone's cups with water.

Take this, for instance, Roland reached out to hold the cup, feeling the warmth emanating from its walls. From the first day fire was utilized, its principle had been established. "Boiling water," witnessed and practiced by countless people, yet no one thought that the gentle rising steam could also contain astonishing energy.

This motive force, which wouldn't be mastered by humans for hundreds of years, changed human history in an extremely short amount of time. Although the principle is simple, due to limitations in technology, it wasn't the first choice for most people who farmed the land. But he was different, he thought, this world also had witches. Using magic for slaughter and battle was but a barbarian's thought... Using magic to create, to replace certain key technologies that hindered the progress of civilization, that was the correct way to use it.

After chatting until the sun set and dining with everyone, Roland returned to his own bedroom.

In this era, there was hardly any nightlife to speak of. If one wasn't procreating, people generally went to bed early. He had considered using the prince's privilege to call for a maid to engage in some 'exercise,' but ultimately he was too shy to speak up.

Just as he had lit the candles in his room, he heard several claps behind him, followed by someone speaking, "What a truly unique lesson, I had not expected His Highness the Fourth Prince to be such a learned scholar."

It was a strange woman's voice. Roland instantly broke out in a cold sweat; a stranger appearing unnoticed in one's room could only be an assassin! He dashed toward the door, but before his hand could reach the doorknob, a cold gust swept past his ear. By the time he regained his senses, a silver-handled dagger was firmly embedded in the door panel, the blade mere finger's width from his cheek.
