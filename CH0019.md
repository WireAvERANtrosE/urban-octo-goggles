## Lecture
After entering winter, the first rain finally fell, and it lasted for two days.

Roland leaned against his desk, watching the hazy town through the window. Rain was lifted by the wind, hitting the glass in successive waves, creating ripples. Under the refraction of these ripples, the town's contours twisted. Houses and streets stretched and deformed, losing their usual orderliness. Due to a lack of efficient drainage, the crisscrossed cobblestone roads were flooded, looking from a distance like many rippling streams.



In the distance, the mountains and forests were shrouded in mist, appearing and disappearing as if they were a mystical realm.



Such scenery, if placed in modern times, would definitely be a tourist destination, but now Roland would rather see a jungle of steel and concrete. The construction of the town walls had to be halted because of the rain, which somewhat diminished his joy from successfully "persuading" the envoy from the stronghold a few days earlier.



"Did you just say that the air around us is made up of many different gases, is that true?"



A clear voice interrupted Roland's thoughts, and Anna blinked her beautiful blue eyes as she asked.



"Cough, Miss Anna, you should use honorifics when addressing His Highness," the Chief Knight reminded from the side.



"That's not necessary," Roland turned around, "she is my student now." Taking advantage of the rainy weather, he had called the two witches and Carter over for a lecture—yes, he had decided to start a course on popular science. The idea of stonemason Karl starting a school had inspired him; if even a stonemason could open a school, why not him, a bona fide engineering geek. Isn't discrimination just the result of ignorance? Universal education is the most effective means to advance civilization in any era.



He had also wanted to invite the assistant minister to join, but the latter had recently been busy with government affairs and had politely declined. For some reason, Roland felt that after winter began, Barov had been particularly energetic, almost single-handedly managing the day-to-day administration of Border Town.



Hearing that there was new knowledge to learn, Anna immediately became spirited, her eyes seemingly shimmering with light. Nana was also happy that she did not have to treat various experimental animals, while Carter came over to listen with an attitude of having nothing better to do anyway.

However, not long after the lesson began, the knight's gaze became scattered. Nana also wore a confused look, staring blankly at the words "nature" and "science." Anna, although appearing only half-understanding, still tried hard to remember everything she heard. Roland had to pause for a moment to let the three digest what they had learned.

Smiling at Anna's question, he nodded, "Of course, even though they look the same."

"Your Highness, I don't understand. If they all look the same, how do you know they are different gases?" Carter expressed his skepticism.

"I can prove it to you."

Roland knew that if he only used words to explain, most people would likely be dizzy with these seemingly profound theories. He decided to use a simple experiment to spark everyone's interest.

A candle, a glass, a wooden basin, and a bowl of clear lime water—these were the items he had prepared in advance, and even though the glass at that time was a pale brown and far from as transparent as a beaker from later times, it was still good enough. After all, this simple experiment did not require observing the change process.

Roland had already done the experiment once before, and the results proved that, although magic existed in this world, the rest of the natural laws were still the same as on Earth. He had Anna light the candle and then place it upright in the wooden basin.

"Combustion consumes a type of gas, which is also closely related to all life. If we stop breathing, it would be like this candle. Watch closely." Roland covered the candle with the glass, and the flame flickered twice before quickly going out.



"It has exhausted the air, Your Highness, it's not surprising," the Chief Knight said nonchalantly, "Without air, we would certainly die, like if we fell into water."

Nana nodded repeatedly.

"So, do you think there's nothing left inside the cup?" Roland asked while pouring lime water into a wooden basin. The waterline quickly submerged the mouth of the cup and finally stopped at the halfway point of the cup.

This experiment was so classic that most primary school teachers liked to use it to enlighten students during natural science classes. Roland still remembered the demonstration and explanation on the teacher's desk that had left him in awe, setting him on the irreversible path of science and engineering.

He gently lifted one corner of the cup, and a few bubbles instantly emerged from the mouth of the cup, popping at the surface of the water.

Then, the clear lime water became slightly turbid, with a small amount of white suspended matter slowly spreading out from the mouth of the cup.

"If there was nothing in the cup, we wouldn't see the bubbles or changes on the water's surface. This indicates that there are at least two different gases in the air. In fact, the candle only consumes a part of the air, while another part cannot participate in combustion. Although it is colorless and odorless like the former, its properties are completely opposite."

"It seems... that is the case," Carter thought for a while before understanding the relationship between the two, "But what's the use of knowing this?"

"If we can obtain the former type of gas, we can make flames burn longer, and similarly, if we can get the latter type, we can extinguish flames quickly!" Anna suddenly spoke up.



She's a genius, Roland praised in his heart. Although there was a small error, the ability to associate the different properties of gases with separation and purification was absolutely genius-level thinking. It's worth noting that she hadn't received any systematic modern education, and the fact that she quickly thought of this was enough to illustrate that her logical abilities were extraordinary—at least far superior to his own Chief Knight.



"Well said. Since humans learned to use fire, they have diverged from animals, and it all originated from an accident. Perhaps it was lightning that ignited the trees, or perhaps it was the sparks from stones striking each other that caused the flames. But if no one had noticed this, if no one had tried to make use of it, we would still be like beasts," he coaxed them gently, "This experiment is intended to show you that curiosity and thought are the driving forces of human progress. There are many such latent forces in nature, just waiting for us to discover and utilize them."



After his speech, Carter still looked half-convinced, while Nana belonged to the type that didn't understand but still thought it was impressive, staring blankly at Roland. Only Anna looked down as if she was pondering something.



Alright, Roland sighed, indeed, overly advanced ideas wouldn't be shocking; they would only make people feel confused. The height of thought determined that they couldn't possibly understand the power of those forces, and only when the actual object was truly presented before them would they realize how magical the latent forces of nature could be.



At that moment, the kettle hanging on the fireplace rack began to clang, the sound of steam hitting the lid.



"Ah, the water is boiling." The knight went over to fetch the kettle with a fork, and the noise quickly ceased. He wrapped the handle with a cloth and poured water into everyone's cups.



Like this, Roland reached for his cup, feeling the warmth transmitted through the walls. From the very first day fire was utilized, its principle was already mature. "Boiling water," witnessed and practiced by countless people, yet no one realized that the gentle wisps of steam rising could also contain amazing energy.



This motive force, which would only be mastered by humans hundreds of years later, changed human history in a very short time. Although the principle was simple, due to technological limitations, it wasn't the preferred choice for most cultivators. But he was different, he thought, this world also had witches. Using magic for slaughter and battle was just the idea of barbarians... Using magic to create, to replace some of the key technologies that hindered the progress of civilization, that was the correct way to use it.



After chatting until sunset and having dinner with everyone, Roland returned to his own bedroom.



In this era, there was hardly any nightlife to speak of. If people were not procreating, they would usually go to bed early. Roland had considered using his prince's privilege to summon a maid to engage in some physical activity, but in the end, his shyness prevented him from voicing this out.



He had just lit the candles in his room when he heard several claps from behind him, followed by someone speaking, "That was quite an unconventional lecture. I never expected His Highness, the Fourth Prince, to be such a learned man."



It was a woman's voice he did not recognize. Cold sweat instantly broke out on Roland's forehead. A stranger who could appear in his room unnoticed—what could they be if not an assassin? He dashed towards the door, but before he could even get his hand on the doorknob, a gust of cold wind whizzed past his ear. By the time he regained his senses, a silver-handled dagger was firmly embedded in the door, the blade a mere finger's width from his cheek.
