## The Will of the Church
Hermes Cathedral's secret chamber.

The Papal seat remained vacant.

The three Bishops sat side by side, with Mayne speaking first, "I heard there has been some unrest in the Kingdom of Everwinter?"

"The Judgement Army stationed there is already dealing with the matter, led by High Priest Kohen," Tavlin replied.

"What exactly caused it?"

"It's those scum who were coaxed into joining the Church," Hesse whistled, "After the queen was beheaded, those nobles joined the Church one after another, transforming overnight into the Church's higher-ups—all because of your Compromise Plan, Lord Mayne. They used the pretext of capturing witches to loot the city, and the city guards turned a blind eye, causing the people to rebel."

"It wasn't my plan, Lord Hesse," Mayne said displeased, "It was His Holiness's decree. Only then could we seize everything in the kingdom in the shortest time without continuing to compete with the nobles—among whom there are also outstanding talents who, if won over, could be greatly beneficial to us. As for those parasites, without the privilege of bloodline succession, they will be weeded out in a single generation."

"Well, since you've even invoked His Holiness, I won't say much more," Hesse shrugged, "But those who tarnish the Church's reputation must be handed over to me."

Mayne looked at Bishop Tavlin, who pondered and said, "I suggest we don't deal with them for the time being. After suppressing the unrest, we can put the offending nobles under house arrest. After all, they have only recently joined the Church, and moving against them now might cause widespread unease among the noble class."



"No!" Heather slammed the table, "The rules of the assembly must not be violated, and any plundering in the name of the Church is a serious crime. Moreover, I'm in charge of the laws and arbitration!"

"But we need to consider the bigger picture at times like this..."

"What I'm talking about is the bigger picture," Heather interrupted Tavore's words. "Don't forget what we relied on to establish an image of fairness and justice throughout Everwinter. If we don't deal a harsh blow to those scum at a time like this, the people of Everwinter will lose faith in us! That is the foundation of the Church—not those damned nobles. If you disagree, I will directly seek an audience with His Holiness the Pope!"

The Pope doesn't have time to worry about such matters, and the foundation of the Church doesn't lie with the people, but with the possession of great power. Mayne sighed and gestured to Tavore not to get too agitated, "Then shall we ask Archbishop Kohen to escort them back to New Holy City for trial?"

"No need, I'll go there myself," said Heather. "I have just finished the recent matters here, and I expect to be back in about two or three months. Trials are naturally better with more people watching, and the Ice and Snow Platform in the capital of Everwinter seems like a good place."

"Are you sure?" Mayne frowned, "We don't have spare commanders to protect you on your way to Everwinter, and if you encounter extraordinary witches, you will be in danger."

"Where are there so many extraordinary witches," Heather said dismissively, "A squad of the Inquisition is enough for me."

"If you insist." Mayne didn't want to dwell on the topic, "I have some bad news here. The Church's army encountered an accident while attacking the Wolfheart Kingdom's Tooth Castle, losing more than twenty God's Punishment Warriors and over a hundred of the Inquisition. Tooth Castle has still not been captured."

"More than twenty God's Punishment Warriors?" Tavore exclaimed, "Who was the commander?"



"The bell tolls, she is already dead."

"The commander killed in action? It seems they really encountered some formidable challenges," Heather said with interest. "Losing so many God's Punishment Army, Lord O'Reilly must be having a headache."



"It's not his fault. The terrain of Toothless Fort is special; the gate is set in the middle of the mountain, about thirty feet (approximately 10 meters) off the ground. They also destroyed the wooden bridge leading to the gate and made use of some alchemist's gadgets," Mayne explained. "According to the reports, after they set up the wooden ladders, the God's Punishment Army had just climbed up when they were attacked by a strange fire—first, a bunch of white solids were sprayed out from the tubes on the gate, then it started to smoke and catch fire. The fire clung to their bodies, impossible to shake off or extinguish, burning them to a crisp. Now they are trying to make contact with the believers inside the city to see if they can launch a pincer attack."



"I bet the church in the city has already been purged," Heather sneered. "If you want to break in, sending more troops to fill in the ranks is the logical approach. Those gadgets from the alchemists have never been able to be produced in large quantities, right? Just fill in the ranks and they will run out."



"But that's the God's Punishment Army!" Tavore's mustache bristled with anger. "Do you know how difficult it is to transform one member of the God's Punishment Army? There are less than a thousand now. If we let the God's Punishment Army suffer more than half losses for the sake of unifying the continent, what will we use to resist the Evil Months? Not to mention the devils that come afterward."



"Stop arguing," Mayne intervened. "I told you this news not to debate the methods of attack. The church currently needs more of the God's Punishment Army. Now that the Everwinter is under the control of the church, some things can be done more legitimately. In the past, 'seeds' were transported twice a year, but now, I request an increase to once per season, starting from summer, since the Evil Months affect the length of spring. Therefore, a batch of seeds will be sent to the Holy City every quarter, and the transformation ceremony will be held correspondingly more often. You will be in charge of this matter, Lord Tavore."



"But there are not that many orphans and infants available," the old bishop stroked his beard. "Not everyone is willing to send their abandoned children to the church."



"That's why you need to find a way to obtain them. Everwinter has been the kingdom with the longest church operation and the most believers. If even this land can't provide enough manpower, the other three kingdoms will only digest it slower. Don't forget, any resistance that arises in the process of unifying the continent must be quelled by the Judgement Army and the God's Punishment Army."



"People are not unavailable," Heather curled her lips. "The children wandering the streets are as numerous as wild cats and dogs. I've heard that the black alley rats specifically recruit these children, training them to become pickpockets, go-betweens, smugglers, or scapegoats. The nobles used to shelter these rats, but now, thanks to Lord Mayne, they have all become part of the church. Without their cover, where can the rats hide? If the Judgement Army is dispatched to annihilate the underground forces, I think you'll collect quite a number of children. At the same time, clearing out the riffraff can leave a good impression on the people, and also deter those nobles who are getting restless. It's a three-for-one deal, isn't it?"



Indeed, it's a decent tactic, Mayne thought. No matter how extreme her temperament, she always manages to come up with the quickest solution to a problem—aside from some words that are deliberately ignored. "Let's implement this method. In any case, before autumn, we must occupy the entirety of the Kingdom of Wolfheart. Other than the Judgement Army stationed to maintain order, all troops must be called back to Hermes to defend against this year's Evil Months—this time, the enemy will only be stronger."



Although Tavlin was somewhat reluctant, he eventually nodded, "When the time comes, if the nobles whose interests are hurt protest, don't blame me for not warning you. Moreover, the Kingdom of Dawn has already noticed the movements in their neighboring country, and many nobles in the cities have directed their spears at the Church, with incidents of robbing and burning churches occurring in some places. I suggest organizing the believers to temporarily withdraw. There's no need to waste them in such conflicts."



"No, they must resist to the end," Mayne vetoed, "The more the believers are sacrificed, the more justified we are to retaliate later. It's not a waste, but kindling for the fire. For kingdoms where the Church has few followers and shallow roots, retreating will only make the Church appear weaker."



"Alright, I'm just putting it out there," Tavlin said with a shrug, "Lastly, there's Greycastle... well, see for yourself." He pulled out a scroll of letter paper from his sleeve and tossed it in front of Mayne.



Mayne unfolded it and glanced over. This letter was actually penned by Queen Grace of Clearwater, Queen Grace Wimbledon herself. Quickly, his brows furrowed.



"She actually hanged Priest Deca?"



"And fed a bunch of believers to the fish," Tavlin added, "The church has also been razed to the ground. She must have discovered the side effects of the pills."



Heather clicked her tongue, "I've said it before, that kind of stuff, even if you keep replenishing it, the effect will diminish more and more, until it leads to weakness and death. Using it to undermine the enemy's army isn't a bad idea, but once the effects start showing, the other side knows what the Church is up to. And the trouble is, I remember previous intelligence mentioned that not many of her subordinates have taken the pills, right? Instead, quite a few were given to those savages from the Southern Borderlands."



"Not more than a thousand," Mayne put down the letter paper, "She says this bill is on our heads. Ridiculous. Could she have become the Queen of Clearwater Port without the support of the Church? Where is Timothy Wimbledon? Having received our pills, why has he not attacked the Southern Borderlands yet?"



"He is currently plundering the Northern Region, claiming that the Northern Border Guard is attempting to rebel and that it is essential to quell the rebellion first to ensure a stable rear defense. Presumably, he wants to take over the territories of several dukes and then fight a decisive battle with Grace," Tefren replied. "The only question is whether this new king, after taking over the Northern Region, will head straight for the Western Region."
