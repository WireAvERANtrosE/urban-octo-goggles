## The Church's Will
Hermes Cathedral's secret chamber.

The Papal Throne remained vacant.

The three bishops sat side by side, with Mayne speaking first, "I heard there has been some unrest in the Kingdom of Everwinter?"

"The Judgement Army stationed there is already dealing with the matter. The team is led by High Priest Corben," Tavlen replied.

"What exactly is the cause?"

"It's those scum who were lured into the Church," Hith sighed and whistled, "After the queen was beheaded, those nobles joined the Church one after another, transforming into the Church's high-ranking officials— all because of your compromise plan, Lord Mayne. Under the guise of hunting witches, they have been rampantly looting within the city, and the City Defense Force turns a blind eye, causing the people's discontent to boil over, naturally leading to backlash."

"It's not my plan, Lord Hith," Mayne replied with displeasure, "It was the will of His Holiness the Pope. This way, we can take control of everything in the kingdom in the shortest time, instead of continuing to struggle with the nobility—among them are also outstanding talents, whose allegiance could be greatly beneficial to us. As for those worms, without the privilege of bloodline succession, they will be eliminated within one generation."

"Well, since you've even brought up His Holiness the Pope, I won't say much more," Hith shrugged, "But those who tarnish the Church's reputation with their misconduct must be handed over to me."

Mayne looked towards Bishop Tavlen, who pondered and said, "I suggest we don't deal with them for now. After suppressing the unrest, we can place the offending nobles under house arrest. After all, they've only joined the Church recently. Taking action against them now might cause widespread unease among the noble class."



"No!" Heather slammed the table and said, "The rules of the Congregation must not be violated. Any plunder carried out in the name of the Church is a serious crime, and I am in charge of the laws and arbitration!"

"At times like these, we must prioritize the bigger picture..."

"What I'm talking about is the bigger picture." Heather directly interrupted Tavlen's words, "Don't forget what it was that allowed us to establish an image of justice and righteousness throughout Everwinter. If we don't strike hard against those scum at a time like this, the people of Everwinter will lose faith in us! That is the foundation of the Church—not those damned nobles. If you disagree, I will take the matter directly to His Holiness the Pope!"

"The Pope has no time to worry about such matters, and the foundation of the Church does not lie with the people, but in having a powerful force." Mayne sighed, gestured with his hand for Tavlen to not get too agitated, "Then shall we have Archbishop Kohen escort them back to the New Holy City for trial?"

"There's no need for that; I will go there personally," said Heather. "I've also finished up with things here recently, and I expect to be back in two or three months. For matters of trial, naturally, the more spectators, the better. The Ice and Snow Platform in the capital of Everwinter seems like a good place."

"Are you sure?" Mayne frowned, "Right now, we don't have spare commanders to protect you on your way to Everwinter, and it will be dangerous if you encounter extraordinary witches."

"Where are there so many extraordinary witches," Heather said nonchalantly, "Just give me a squad of the Judgement Army and that will be enough."

"If you insist." Mayne didn't want to dwell on the topic, "I have some bad news here. The Church's army encountered an accident while attacking Wolfheart Kingdom's Impassable Mountain Range Fortress, losing more than twenty God's Punishment Army soldiers and over a hundred from the Judgement Army. To this moment, the Impassable Mountain Range Fortress has yet to be conquered."

"More than twenty from the God's Punishment Army?" Tavlen exclaimed, "Who was the commander?"



"Bell, she's already dead."

"The commander died in battle? It seems they really encountered a formidable challenge," Heather said with interest. "To lose so many God's Punishment Army soldiers at once, Lord Rene must be having a headache."

"You can't blame him. The terrain of the Toothless Fortress is special; its gate is set halfway up a mountain, a full thirty feet (about 10 meters) above the ground. They've also destroyed the wooden bridge leading to the gate and made use of some alchemist's tricks," Mayne explained. "According to the reports, after they set up ladders, the God's Punishment Army had just climbed up when they were attacked with strange flames—first, a bunch of white solids spewed out from the tubes on the gate, then it started smoking and burning. The flames stuck to their bodies and couldn't be shaken or put out, burning the person to a crisp. Now they are trying to contact the believers inside the city to see if they can launch a pincer attack from the inside and outside."

"I bet the church in the city has already been purged," Heather sneered, "If you want to break through, sending more people to fill in the ranks is the obvious solution. Those alchemist's tricks have never been able to be produced in large quantities, right? Just fill in the ranks and they'll be exhausted."

"But that's the God's Punishment Army!" Tavorel's beard quivered with anger. "Do you know how difficult it is to convert one God's Punishment Army soldier? Now there are less than a thousand left. If we let the God's Punishment Army suffer more than half of their losses for the unification of the continent, what will we use to resist the Evil Months? Not to mention the devils that come afterward."

"Stop arguing," Mayne interjected. "I'm telling you this news not to debate the methods of attack. The church currently needs more of the God's Punishment Army. Now that the Church controls Everwinter, some things can be done more justifiably. In the past, we transported 'seeds' twice a year, but now, I'm asking for an increase. The influence of the Evil Months on spring is inconsistent, so starting from summer, we should send a batch of seeds to the Holy City every quarter, and the conversion ceremony will also be held correspondingly more often. This task is entrusted to you, Lord Tavorel."

"But there aren't that many orphans and infants available," the old archbishop stroked his beard, "Not everyone is willing to send their abandoned children to the church."

"That's why you need to find a way to win them over. Everwinter has been the kingdom with the longest church operation and the most believers. If even this land can't provide enough manpower, the other three kingdoms will only digest even slower. Don't forget, any resistance that arises in the process of unifying the continent has to be quelled by the Judgement Army and the God's Punishment Army."

"People are not unavailable," Heather curled her lips, "The street kids are as common as stray cats and dogs. I've heard that there are even underground rats recruiting these children, training them to become pickpockets, intermediaries, smugglers, or scapegoats. When the nobility were still around, they could provide shelter for these rats, but now, thanks to Lord Mayne, they've all become part of the church. With no cover over the gutter, where can the rats hide? If you send out the Judgement Army to wipe out the underground forces in one swoop, I think you'll gather quite a few children. At the same time, cleansing the scum will leave a good impression on the people, and it will also deter those restless nobles. Killing three birds with one stone, isn't it?"



It is indeed a good method, Maine thought, no matter how extreme her temperament might be, she always thought of the fastest countermeasure when facing problems—aside from the fact that she deliberately ignored some words. "Let's implement it this way. In any case, before autumn, we must occupy the entire territory of the Kingdom of Wolfheart. Apart from the Judgement Army stationed to maintain order, all other troops must be recalled to Hermes to defend against this year's Evil Months—this time, the enemy will only be stronger."



Although Taveylan was reluctant, he finally nodded, "When the time comes, don't blame me for not warning you if the nobles whose interests are harmed jump out to protest. In addition, the Kingdom of Dawn has already noticed the movements of the neighboring country, and many nobles in the cities have turned their spears against the Church, with incidents of looting and burning churches occurring in some places. I suggest organizing the believers to temporarily evacuate. There's no need to waste them in such conflicts."



"No, they must resist to the end," Maine rejected, "The more the believers are sacrificed, the more justified we will be in launching our retaliation later. This is not a waste but the kindling for the fire. For kingdoms where the Church has few believers and shallow roots, retreating will only make the Church appear weaker."



"Alright, I'm just bringing it up," Taveylan said with a shrug, "Lastly, it's about Greycastle... well, you can see for yourself." He took out a scroll of letter paper from his sleeve and tossed it in front of Maine.



Maine unfurled it and glanced over it. This letter was actually penned by Queen Grace of Clearwater herself. Quickly, his eyebrows furrowed.



"She actually hanged the Deacon?"



"And fed a bunch of believers to the fishes," Taveylan added, "The church has also been leveled to the ground. She must have discovered the side effects of the pills."



Heather clicked her tongue, "I told you, even if you keep replenishing those things, their effects would become weaker and weaker, until eventually they would weaken and die. Using that kind of thing to undermine the enemy's army is not bad, but once the effects emerge, the other side also knows what the Church is up to. And the trouble is, I remember previous intelligence mentioned that not many of her subordinates have taken the pills, right? Instead, many were given to those barbarians from the Southern Territory."



"Not more than a thousand," Maine put down the letter paper, "She says this debt is on our heads. Ridiculous, could she have become the Queen of Clearwater Port without the support of the Church? Where is Timothy Wimbledon? Having received our pills, why has he not yet attacked the Southern Territory?"



"He is currently plundering the northern territories, claiming that the guardians of the North are attempting to rebel and that it is imperative to quell the rebellion first to avoid instability in the rear defenses. It seems he intends to collect the domains of several dukes into his grasp before engaging Grace in a decisive battle," Tefren answered. "It's just uncertain whether this new king, after taking over the North, will head straight for the Western Region."
