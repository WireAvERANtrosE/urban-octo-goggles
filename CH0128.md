## Pill Experiment
She then picked up the Judgement Army's longsword, stabbed Phyllis to death, and cleaved another member of the Judgement Army in half, shattering the blade into several pieces. However, the whistle alarmed the entire monastery, and many people came rushing over with their lamps. She stripped off Phyllis' clothes to wear for herself, picked up another's weapon, and walked alone towards the guards swarming in.



I sat dazed in the blood-soaked room for a while before I came to my senses. Among the dead was one who held the keys to all the entrances and exits of the monastery. I rummaged through the scattered clothes and found the keys, and also stripped them of their Divine Stones of Judgement—I didn't know the stones' purpose at the time, just thought their translucent appearance might fetch a good price. The monastery's priests, guards, and Judgement Army were all lured away by her, and I almost walked unimpeded to a little-known back gate in the courtyard. I tried all the keys until I finally opened the small door and left the monastery.



Later on, I only sold one of the stones; the rest were snatched away. I survived on those dozen or so Silver royals, wandering all the way to Fjords before I stopped. Two years later in winter, I also awakened as a witch." Wendy paused, "That's my whole story."



Nightingale held her hand and was silent for a long time before speaking, "What about the girl from the etiquette class?"



"Maybe she died, maybe she escaped. I inquired later, and the church claimed there was a fire at the monastery and then closed it down. No one knows, and no one cares where the girls inside went. They were all abandoned."



Nightingale sighed deeply and embraced Wendy, "Now you have us. Sleep, Wendy."



It was a long time before she softly replied, "Mm..."



...



The next day, Roland yawned as he stepped into his office, only to see Nightingale sitting seriously at the desk waiting for him.



"Uh, what happened?"

"Have you ever heard of the Extraordinaries?" she asked in a grave voice.

Seeing the prince shake his head, Nightingale recounted the story Wendy had told the night before, "If it wasn't for awakening, I find it hard to imagine how an underage girl could easily slay a fully armed Judgement Army."

"A witch not constrained by the Divine Stone of Judgement..." Roland pondered for a moment after listening and recalled the categories he had created for witch abilities, "Could she be a Body-Enhancing type witch?"

"Body-Enhancing... what type?"

Roland pulled out a piece of paper from the drawer and handed it to her, "Based on how you use magic, I made a basic classification. Body-Enhancing type witches are constantly consuming magic power, transforming themselves, and this type of change is not affected by the Divine Stone of Judgement. Although the physical condition of a typical witch improves due to the accommodation of magic power, Body-Enhancing witches are more notable in this regard. If I'm not misunderstanding, Scroll, in the eyes of the Church, should also be considered an Extraordinary."

"Scroll?" Nightingale was taken aback, "But she..."

"But she's not good at fighting, right." Roland said with a smile, "This classification isn't a measure of strength or weakness, nor is it necessarily entirely accurate, it's just my personal thoughts and speculations. A strength-enhanced witch could indeed cause a lot of trouble for the Church. Without the restraint of the Divine Stone of Judgement, she could selectively take out squads of the Judgement Army, or single-handedly strike down the churches of small towns. However, the power of one person is ultimately limited, and the number of witches awakened as Body-Enhancing types must be fewer than the other two types, otherwise, it would be the witches hunting down the Church."

He spoke lightly, but the thought of those two pills, one red and one black, gave him an uneasy premonition.

Even if Extraordinaries are few, there should be at least a dozen or so over the past century, right? If just two or three of them were strength-enhanced types, they could cause considerable unrest for the Church. For example, taking advantage of the annual Evil Months when the Church focuses all its efforts on the Hermes defence line, they could extensively clear the Church facilities in other cities, eliminating the churches, priests, and bishops. Over the years, the Church's followers would likely greatly diminish.



However, aside from the Extraordinary that Wendy happened to encounter, Roland had not heard of any other instances of witches counterattacking the Church. Moreover, the monastery where Wendy lived as a child had been covered by a great fire, and the whereabouts of the nuns of the Ritual Division were unknown to anyone.

The Church definitely wouldn't just sit and wait for death, he thought; perhaps they already had means to combat the Extraordinary, and these two pills might be one of them.

In any case, it was time to test the effects of the pills.

Thinking this, Roland called the guard outside his door, instructing him to fetch a prisoner from the dungeon and to summon Carter as well.

The testing site was arranged outside the city walls.

To be cautious, Roland called over four squads of First Army soldiers, who formed a ring around the testing site, guns at the ready.

On the city walls, in addition to himself and Nightingale, stood Anna and Nana. Without the Divine Stone of Judgement, Anna's emerald flame wall was more than enough to ensure her own safety. Nana could provide the quickest healing.

"Are you sure there's no problem?" Roland leaned down and asked Carter Lannis, who was limbering up below, "Don't underestimate the opponent."

"Rest assured, Your Highness," Carter donned his helmet, "Your Chief Knight is not famous for nothing. And besides, the opponent is using a wooden sword, there's no chance they could injure me."



The test subject was a death-row inmate convicted of robbery and murder. Roland didn't like the idea of offering a commutation for services rendered, so he straightforwardly told the prisoner that if he sacrificed himself for the test, his family would receive a reward of five gold royals. After a moment's hesitation, the other party agreed to the terms.



Carter had originally hoped that the convict would don armor, take up an iron sword, and engage in a fair fight with him, but Roland rejected the idea without hesitation. If the death-row inmate got his hands on sharp weapons, the danger would increase exponentially, and if the knight's head were chopped off, Nana wouldn't be able to bring him back to life. The absence of armor was precisely for testing the pain tolerance effect of the black pills.



After swallowing two pills, the convict's expression changed rapidly, veins bulging on his forehead and arms, his skin turning a deep red, and his breathing becoming hurried. He grabbed a wooden sword and charged at the knight, who was waiting calmly, with a speed that rivaled a running wolf, creating small pits in the muddy ground with each step.



Carter looked somewhat surprised but still calmly sidestepped and swung his sword horizontally. This move would force the opponent to change direction or be sliced in the ribs by the sword.



The opponent was just a murderer, with nothing but brute strength and no formal combat training. He predictably lunged into empty space, and a deep gash was cut open on his side, blood flowing out. Such a wound would be enough to impair the movement of half of his body, but he seemed to disregard it completely, turning and lunging at the knight again. Carter repeated his technique, but this time with a slight variation. As they brushed past each other, the convict twisted his body and swung the wooden sword with one hand towards the knight's position. The awkward posture should not have posed a threat, but as the wooden sword swept by, the knight only saw a blur and instinctively raised his sword to block. The powerful impact forced him to take two steps back, and the wooden sword snapped.



"You've got some strength," Carter shook his hand, "Give him another sword, and let's go again."



But the convict did not take the wooden sword thrown by the soldiers; instead, he suddenly turned and bolted towards the Misty Forest. In the blink of an eye, his speed reached a level unattainable by ordinary people—as fast as a wild horse, his arms stretched out in front of him, he crashed into a soldier who was ready to fire his gun. The latter let out a cry of pain, was sent flying into the air, and at that moment the other soldiers pulled their triggers. Several bullet wounds appeared on the convict's back, but his speed did not diminish, and he quickly broke through the encirclement, covering more than ten meters in a few breaths.



"Don't let him escape," Carter shouted, "Bring my horse!"



Before the knight could mount his horse, the convict suddenly shuddered, looking incredulously at his own abdomen as a slanted, gaping wound across his belly burst open, and his steaming intestines tumbled out.



Slowly turning his head, a woman in white appeared behind him at some point, holding a gleaming silver dagger in her hand.
