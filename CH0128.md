## Pill Experiment
She picked up the Judgement Army's longsword, stabbed Farian to death, and then cleaved another member of the Judgement Army in two, breaking the blade into several pieces. But the whistle had alerted the entire monastery, and many people carrying oil lamps were rushing towards her. She stripped Farian's clothes and put them on herself, picked up another person's weapon, and walked alone towards the swarming guards.



I sat in the blood-soaked room, dazed for a good while before I came to my senses. Among the dead was one who held the keys to the various entrances and exits of the monastery. I rummaged through the clothes scattered around and found the keys, and at the same time stripped them of their God's Punishment Stones—I did not know the use of the stones back then, I just felt that their crystal-clear appearance might fetch a good price. The monastery's priests, guards, and the Judgement Army were all lured away by her, and I walked almost unimpeded to a little-known small door in the backyard. I tried all the keys and eventually opened the door to leave the monastery.



Later on, I only sold one of the stones, and the rest were snatched away. I survived on those dozen or so Silver royals, wandering all the way to the Seawind Region before I stopped. Two winters later, I also awakened as a witch." Wendy paused, "That's my entire story."



Nightingale held her hand, silent for a long time before speaking: "What happened to that girl from the etiquette class?"



"Perhaps she died, or perhaps she escaped. I inquired later, and the Church claimed that there had been a fire in the monastery and then closed it down. Nobody knows, and nobody cares where those girls went. They were all abandoned."



Nightingale sighed deeply and embraced Wendy, "Now you have us. Sleep, Wendy."



It took a long while before she softly replied, "Mhm..."



...



The next day, when Roland yawned and stepped into his office, he saw Nightingale sitting seriously by the table waiting for him.



"Uh, what happened?"

"Have you ever heard of the Extraordinaries?" she asked gravely.

Seeing the prince shake his head, Nightingale recounted the story Wendy had told the night before, "If it wasn't for awakening, I can hardly imagine an underage girl could easily kill fully armored Judgement Army soldiers."

"A witch not restrained by the God's Stone of Retribution..." Roland pondered for a moment after listening, recalling the categories he had created for the witches' abilities, "Could she be a self-strengthening type witch?"

"Self... what type?"

Roland pulled out a piece of paper from the drawer and handed it to her, "I've made a basic classification based on how you use magic. The self-strengthening type witches are constantly consuming magic to transform themselves, and this change is not affected by the God's Stone of Retribution. Although the physical fitness of a general witch also improves due to the containment of magic, the self-strengthening type witches are more prominent. If I am not mistaken, Scroll, in the eyes of the Church, should also be considered an Extraordinary."

"Scroll?" Nightingale was taken aback, "But she..."

"But she's not good at fighting, right?" Roland said with a smile, "This classification is not a judgment of strength or weakness, nor is it necessarily completely correct. It's just my personal idea and speculation. A strength-enhanced type witch could indeed cause a lot of trouble for the Church. Without the restraint of the God's Stone of Retribution, she can selectively kill squads of the Judgement Army or single-handedly take down the church in a small town. However, the power of one person is ultimately limited, and the witches who awaken as self-strengthening types must be fewer than the other two types, otherwise, it would be the witches hunting down the Church."

He spoke lightly, but thinking of those two pills, one red and one black, he had a vague sense of unease.

No matter how few the Extraordinaries were, there should have been about a dozen or so in the last hundred years, right? If just two or three of them were strength-enhanced types, they could make the Church restless. For example, taking advantage of the annual Evil Months when the Church focuses all its efforts on the Hermes Plateau, they could extensively clear other cities' Church facilities, wiping out churches, priests, and bishops all together. Over the years, the Church's followers would likely decrease significantly.



However, other than the Extraordinary that Wendy happened to encounter, Roland had never heard of any incidents of witches counterattacking the Church. Moreover, even the monastery where Wendy spent her childhood was covered up by a great fire, and the whereabouts of the female members of the God's Punishment Army remained unknown.



The Church certainly would not sit waiting for death, he thought. Perhaps they had already acquired the means to counter the Extraordinary, and these two pills might be one of them.



Regardless, it was time to test the effects of the pills first.



With that thought, Roland called for his personal guard outside the door, instructing him to fetch a prisoner from the jail and to summon Carter over as well.



The testing ground was arranged outside the city walls.



To be on the safe side, Roland brought over four squads of the First Army soldiers to form a circle around the testing ground, on alert with their guns.



On the city wall, besides himself and Nightingale, there stood Anna and Nana. As long as there was no God's Punishment Stone, Anna's green flame wall was more than enough to ensure her own safety. Nana, on the other hand, could provide the fastest healing.



"Any problems?" Roland bent down and asked Carter Lannis, who was stretching his muscles below, "Don't underestimate the opponent."



"Rest assured, Your Highness," Carter put on his helmet, "Your Chief Knight is not renowned for nothing. Besides, the opponent is using a wooden sword; there's no chance they could harm me."



The test subject was a death row inmate convicted of robbery and murder. Roland didn't like to play the game of offering criminals a chance to earn their redemption through service; instead, he straightforwardly told the prisoner that if he sacrificed himself for the test, his family would receive a reward of five gold royals. After a moment's hesitation, the other party agreed to the condition.



Carter had originally hoped the man would put on armor, pick up an iron sword, and have a fair fight with him, but Roland refused without hesitation. If the condemned man were to use sharp weapons, the risk would increase exponentially. If he managed to chop off the knight's head, even Nana wouldn't be able to bring him back to life. As for not wearing armor, it was precisely for testing the pain endurance of the black pill.



After swallowing two pills, the expression on the prisoner's face quickly changed. Veins bulged out on his forehead and arms, his skin turned a deep red, and his breathing became rapid. He grabbed a wooden sword and charged at the calmly waiting knight with a speed comparable to a running wolf, kicking up small pits in the mud with each step.



Carter seemed somewhat surprised, but he still sidestepped smoothly and swung his sword horizontally. This move would force the opponent to change direction, or else his ribs would be sliced open by the blade.



The opponent was nothing more than a murderer, possessing brute strength but no real combat training. As expected, he lunged into empty air, receiving a deep cut on his side, with blood flowing out. Such an injury should have affected the movement of half of his body, but he seemed not to care at all and turned to pounce on the knight again. Carter repeated his move, but this time there was a slight difference. As they brushed past each other, the prisoner twisted his body and swung the wooden sword single-handedly toward the knight's position. The awkward force of the swing should not have been threatening, but in the moment the wooden sword swept out, the knight only saw a blur. He instinctively raised his sword to block, and the powerful impact forced him to retreat two steps. The wooden sword also broke on impact.



"You've got some strength," Carter shook his hand, "Give him a sword, let's go again."



The prisoner didn’t take the wooden sword thrown by the soldier; instead, he suddenly turned and dashed toward the Misty Forest, his speed reaching a level unattainable by ordinary people—like a galloping wild horse, he ran with his arms stretched out in front, and slammed straight into a soldier who was preparing to fire his gun. The latter let out a scream as he was sent flying into the air, and at that moment, other soldiers had already pulled their triggers. Several blooms of blood burst from the prisoner's back, but his speed remained undiminished, and he quickly broke out of the encirclement, running more than ten meters away in a few breaths.



"Don't let him get away," Carter shouted, "Bring me my horse!"



Before the knight could mount his horse, the prisoner suddenly shuddered, looking at his belly in disbelief as a diagonal gash across his abdomen gaped open, and his steaming intestines tumbled out.



Turning his head slowly, a woman in white had appeared behind him at some point, holding a gleaming silver dagger in her hand.
