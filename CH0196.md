## The Calamity of the Church
Raymond and his party rode their horses through the streets of Longsong Stronghold.

After the battle, the residents all hid in their homes, not venturing out, and the streets were devoid of people, which made them seem somewhat desolate.



"Sir Raymond, is your hand alright?" the "Steady Shield" Knight, Leven, asked.



"It's nothing serious," Raymond Horace shrugged, "at least it can still move." However, this movement made him frown immediately.



Last night's battle for the gate went smoothly. There were only about twenty guards stationed at the stronghold's east gate, and they had never expected the enemy to attack from inside the city.



Although the horn was sounded, reinforcements would take at least a quarter of an hour to arrive. Fifteen mercenaries who had taken the pills rushed to the top of the city wall, killing the guards one by one, while Raymond led the knights to open the city gate. In the dim light, he had not noticed a side door by the city wall, and unexpectedly, two guards charged out from there, one of them wielding a hammer at him.



To facilitate the turning of the winch, his weapon had been tucked at his waist, and in the rush, Raymond had no choice but to use his arm to block. Almost at the same time, Leven on the other side extended his longsword, stabbing straight into the waist of the guard. Affected by this fatal blow, the falling hammer lost much of its force, but it still left a dent in his arm armor.



At that moment, Raymond didn't feel much pain, but after taking the city gate, he realized that he could hardly lift his right arm. After undoing his arm armor, he saw that his forearm had swollen up like a rolling pin.



"Hopefully, the church has some herbs that can relieve pain," Leven said, "They often prepare some strange and curious things."



"For example, the pills," another knight, Dorn, came up with a chuckle.



Thirteen knights had lost two in the night raid, and one was seriously injured, now lying in the camp groaning and probably wouldn't survive the night. All things considered, it was an acceptable loss, Leman thought. Now that the militia had entered the city, the stronghold was completely in their hands.



Before long, the group arrived at the church entrance, where a militia of over a hundred men was waiting for orders. Upon seeing Leman, they all showed faces eager with anticipation.



"Distribute the pills to them." Leman dismounted and waited until everyone had taken a pill before leading the team up the steps towards the main hall.



"Halt," two believers guarding the door shouted, "No weapons are allowed on the sacred ground!"



Levin drew his weapon and handed it over with both hands, "I know, is this okay for you?" As a believer reached out to take the long sword, he suddenly gripped the hilt and jerked it upward, and the other's hands fell as if on cue.



"Ah—" The believer's scream had not yet escaped his throat when the knight thrust the sword tip into it.



Although Levin was nicknamed "Steady Shield," his swift swordsmanship was rarely matched.



The other believer had his throat cut by Dorn, and Leman kicked open the main door, walking into the hall with an expressionless face.



"Who are you people?" A middle-aged man dressed in a priest robe with a white base and blue trim stepped forward without fear in the face of the bloody blades. "How dare you barge into the church! Children, seize them!"



Raymond sneered. Now that most of the townsfolk were staying at home, there were only about twenty or thirty believers residing in the church. Against battle-hardened knights, any resisters would only meet their deaths.



Without waiting for an order, Doron had already drawn his sword with a sinister laugh and chopped down a believer who rushed forward. The others quickly joined the fight, and chaos ensued within the church. Seeing the situation turn dire, the priest shouted, "Children, take the God's Punishment Army Pills, let the divine power grant you the strength to defeat these thugs!"



His Majesty Timothy guessed right, Raymond thought with glee. There really were pills here! He saw the believers' eyes suddenly turn red, and veins bulged on their faces. Under the effect of the pills, an ordinary person could burst forth with strength and speed beyond human limits, and the more confined the space, the harder it was to deal with. Unfortunately, you're not the only ones with such things, he thought. Enjoy a taste of your own power.



"Make way," he bellowed, "Militia, face the enemy!"



The militia at the rear could hardly wait to swallow the bicolor pills and then clashed with the frenzied believers. It was only at this point that the priest's expression finally changed, "Why do you also have...!"



"God's Punishment Army Pills?" Raymond circled around the two groups locked in combat, sword in one hand as he approached the priest. "This was a gift from the Church itself. If it weren't for your interference, His Majesty would probably have unified Greycastle by now."



"His Majesty?" The priest's eyes widened. "You're one of Timothy's—"



His voice cut off abruptly as the knight's sword pierced into his chest, penetrating his heart and lungs.



The lopsided battle ended quickly, with more than twenty believers slaughtered to near extinction, their bodies strewn haphazardly across the ground. As the effects of the drugs wore off, the militiamen let out heavy breaths and contentedly sat down against the corpses, not minding the blood that flowed freely.



Raymond felt his arm growing heavier, the sword strike from before having left him with a tearing pain. Sometimes he too wanted to swallow one of those black pills, to ignore the fatigue and pain in his body, but each time he saw the disgraceful state of those who took the drugs, he retracted the thought.



Raymond had gained a deep understanding of the two types of pills sold by the Church. For a healthy person, the pills could work at most three times, the first lasting about a quarter of an hour, with subsequent durations becoming shorter and forming a strong dependence. If one did not take the pills for a long time, their body would gradually decline until death.



Using this characteristic, he had all the militiamen take the pills before setting out, forcing them to obey his commands, and the craving for the drug could turn even the weakest farmer into a bloodthirsty beast. Now this group of over a hundred people was on their second dose, and they had only one use left.



However... even after three times, continuously supplementing with the drug could only alleviate the pain, not reverse the process. In other words, as soon as one swallowed the first pill, it was as if one foot was already in the coffin. Of course, this was not something Raymond would tell these people.



There was no doubt that the bicolor secret medicine was a conspiracy of the Church, and His Majesty Timothy had clearly recognized this, so he prohibited any knight from using it. However, it was also a weapon to unify the kingdom, or rather... a necessity. Without it, His Majesty would not be able to defeat Grace Wimbledon, who also had access to the pills.



When he first heard His Majesty mention this, Raymond could hardly believe it. He simply could not understand why the Church would support two royal bloodlines in a struggle for the throne. However, a series of changes that followed made him increasingly agree with His Majesty's judgment. Now that he had seen these pills in the churches of the Western Territory, he had no more doubts—the Church did not intend to help any prince ascend to the throne; they wanted the entirety of Greycastle.



"We've found the pills in the basement, four large boxes, several thousand of them," Levyn reported excitedly after thoroughly scavenging the church, "There are also plenty of gold royals, jewels, and silks, likely donated by the believers."



"Take everything we can carry, and burn all that we can't," Raymond instructed, "After all, this is all Roland Wimbledon's doing. We are just helping the Church suppress the rebellion."



Since the holy medicine must rely on the Church's supply, now was not the time to completely fall out with them. Pinning the blame on the Fourth Prince also meant there would be no evidence of their death. To avoid arousing the Church's suspicion, His Majesty remained in the North, pretending to follow their directives, yet he dispatched himself with a small contingent of knights, calling upon a large number of militia to seize the Western Territory.



Now, with the Church's forces all concentrated in the Kingdom of Wolfheart, they had no time to pay attention to the situation here. Therefore, it was necessary to unify Greycastle as quickly as possible to be able to draw strength to resist the Church's offensive—His Majesty Timothy believed that it was only a matter of time before they launched an attack on Greycastle. Before that happened, it was imperative to store and collect as many pills as possible. He also ordered the Alchemist Association of the capital to study the ingredients of the holy medicine, hoping to replicate it as soon as possible.



Now that the pills were in hand, only the last step of the mission remained—to completely eliminate Roland Wimbledon.
