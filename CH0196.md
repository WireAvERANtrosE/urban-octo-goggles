## The Calamity of the Church
Raymond and his group rode their horses through the streets of Longsong Stronghold.

After the battle, the residents of the city had all hidden in their homes, not venturing out, leaving the streets half-deserted and somewhat bleak.

"Sir Raymond, is your hand alright?" the 'Stalwart Shield' Knight Levin asked.

"It's not a big issue," Raymond Horace shrugged. "At least it can still move." However, this action made him frown immediately.

Last night's battle for the gate had gone smoothly. There were only about twenty guards left at the stronghold's eastern gate, and they had never expected the enemy to attack from within the city.

Although the horn was sounded, it would take at least a quarter of an hour for reinforcements to arrive. Fifteen mercenaries who had taken the pills charged to the top of the wall and killed the guards one by one, while Raymond led the knights to open the city gate. In the dim light, he didn't notice a side door by the city wall, out of which two guards suddenly emerged, one swinging a hammer at him.

To facilitate the turning of the winch, his weapon had been stowed at his waist. In the rush, Raymond had no choice but to block with his arm. Almost at the same time, Levin on the other side drew his longsword and stabbed it into the waist of the guard. Affected by this fatal blow, the hammer's swing lost much of its force, but it still left a dent in his armguard.

At the time, Raymond didn't feel much pain, but after taking the gate, he realized that he could hardly lift his right arm. Upon removing his armguard, he saw that his forearm had swollen to the size of a rolling pin.

"Hopefully, the church has some herbs for pain relief," Levin said. "They often prepare some odd trinkets."



"Take Meatball, for example," another knight, Doran, came over with a grin.



Thirteen knights had lost two men in the night raid, and one was seriously injured, now lying in the camp groaning, likely not to survive the night. All things considered, Lehman thought the losses were acceptable. By now, the militia had entered the city, and the fortress had completely fallen into their hands.



Soon, the group arrived at the entrance of the church, where a militia of over a hundred men was waiting for orders. Upon seeing Lehman, they all showed eager expressions.



"Distribute the pills to them." Lehman dismounted from his horse and watched as everyone took the pills before leading the troops up the stairs towards the main hall.



"Halt," two believers guarding the door shouted, "No weapons are allowed in this holy place!"



Levin drew his weapon and handed it over with both hands. "I know, I know. Is this good enough for you?" Just as the believer reached out to take the longsword, Levin suddenly gripped the hilt and flicked it upwards, causing both of the believer's hands to drop off.



"Ah—" The believer's scream hadn't even escaped his throat when the knight had already thrust the sword tip into his neck.



Although Levin's nickname was the Sturdy Shield, his quick swordsmanship was rarely matched.



Doran also slit the throat of another believer, and Lehman kicked open the main door, walking into the hall with an expressionless face.



"Who are you people?" A middle-aged man dressed in a priest's robe with a white base and blue edges stepped forward, unafraid of the bloody blade, "How dare you break into the church! Children, seize them!"

Raymond sneered. Most of the townsfolk were staying at home, and only about twenty or thirty believers were usually in the church. Against battle-hardened knights, the resisters had only one way to go—death.

Before he could give an order, Dorn had already drawn his sword with a maniacal laugh and cut down a believer who had rushed forward. The others quickly joined the fight, and chaos ensued within the church. Seeing the situation turn dire, the priest shouted, "Children, take the holy medicine, let the gods grant you the power to defeat the thugs!"

His Majesty Timothy had guessed right, Raymond thought with joy; there were indeed pills here! He saw the believers' eyes suddenly turn blood red, and veins bulge on their faces. Under the effect of the drug, an ordinary person could burst out with strength and speed beyond human limits; the narrower the terrain, the more difficult to deal with. Unfortunately, you are not the only ones who have this thing, he thought, savor your own power for a change.

"Make way," he roared, "Militia, to the enemy!"

Hearing this command, the militia behind him couldn't wait to swallow the dual-colored pills and then clashed with the frenzied believers. It was only at this moment that the priest's complexion finally changed, "Why do you have...!"

"Holy medicine?" Raymond walked around the groups of fighters, sword in hand, approaching the priest, "This is a gift from the Church itself. If it weren't for your obstruction, His Majesty would have probably unified Greycastle already."

"His Majesty?" The priest's eyes widened, "You are Timothy's—"

His voice cut off abruptly as the knight's sword had already pierced his chest, penetrating his heart and lungs.



The lopsided battle ended quickly, with more than twenty believers slaughtered to near extinction, their bodies strewn about haphazardly on the ground. As the effects of the drug faded, the militiamen let out heavy breaths, contentedly sitting down against the corpses, not minding the blood that flowed freely.



Raymond felt his arm growing heavier, the sword strike he delivered earlier causing a tearing pain. Sometimes he too wanted to swallow one of those black pills, to ignore the fatigue and pain of his body, but each time he saw the unsightly state of those who took the drug, he would dispel the thought.



He had come to a profound understanding of the two types of pills sold by the Church. For a healthy person, the pill could only be effective three times at most, the first time for about a quarter of an hour, with the duration decreasing each subsequent time, while also forming a strong dependency. If one did not take the pill for a long time, their body would gradually decline until death.



Using this characteristic, he had the militia take the pills before setting out, forcing them to obey his command, and the craving for the drug could turn even the weakest farmer into a bloodthirsty beast. Now, these hundred or so men had taken the drug for the second time, and they only had one use left.



However... even if the drug was continuously replenished after the third time, it could only alleviate the pain, not reverse the process. In other words, once the first pill was swallowed, it was as if one foot had already stepped into the coffin. Of course, this was not something Raymond would tell these people.



Undoubtedly, the two-color secret medicine was a conspiracy of the Church, and His Majesty Timothy had clearly recognized this, which is why he forbade any knight from using it. But it was also a weapon to unify the kingdom, or rather... a necessity. Without it, His Majesty could not defeat Grace Wimbledon, who also possessed the pills.



When Raymond first heard His Majesty mention this, he couldn't believe it; he simply couldn't understand why the Church would support two royal bloodlines in a struggle for the throne. However, the series of changes that followed made him increasingly agree with His Majesty's judgment, and now that he had seen these pills in the churches of the Western Territory, he no longer had any doubts—the Church did not intend to help any prince ascend the throne; what they wanted was the entirety of Greycastle.



"We found the pills in the basement, four large boxes, thousands of them," Levin reported excitedly after thoroughly scouring the church, "There's also a fair amount of gold royals, jewels, and silk, probably donations from the believers."



"Take everything we can carry, and burn everything we can't," Raymond instructed, "After all, this is the work of Roland Wimbledon, we're just helping the Church suppress the rebellion."



Since the Holy Medicine must rely on the Church for supply, it's not yet time to completely break with them, blaming the Fourth Prince also counts as having no proof of death. To avoid arousing the Church's suspicion, His Majesty stayed in the North, pretending to follow their directions, but he sent a small number of knights and recruited a large number of militia to seize the Western Territory.



Now the Church's forces are all concentrated in the Kingdom of Wolfheart and have no time to attend to the situation here, so it is necessary to unify Greycastle as soon as possible to free up the strength to resist the Church's attack—His Majesty Timothy believes that their attack on Greycastle is inevitable. Before that happens, it's important to store and collect as many pills as possible. He also ordered the Alchemist Association of the royal capital to research the ingredients of the Holy Medicine, hoping to replicate it soon.



Now that the pills are in hand, the only task left is the last step—to completely eliminate Roland Wimbledon.
