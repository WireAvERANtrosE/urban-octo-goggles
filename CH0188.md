## "The show has begun!"
After a field trip to the northern slope mine and two days of negotiations, Roland reached a new trade pact with Hogg and the Crescent Moon Bay caravan.



Hogg's eyes nearly popped out when he saw the mining rail system operating at high speed. He even proposed investing in a factory in Border Town to specifically build mining rails and related equipment, splitting the profits equally, but Roland rejected his offer—it's only when there is a surplus of people that you attract investment, and right now, the town lacks people, not money.



Hogg is, after all, just a mining businessman. Although he owns several mines and manages an open-pit silver mine for Earl Cambela in Silver City, the only workers he can provide are miners. This is far less than the strength of Crescent Moon Bay, which owns an entire island. Eventually, he signed a contract for the purchase of steam engines to be delivered in half a year, also ten units, along with a complete mining transportation system (including tracks and mine carts), half to be delivered before the Evil Months and the rest in the following year.



The Crescent Moon Bay caravan, on the other hand, was much bolder in their negotiations. Gamor signed a ten-year agreement directly. When the caravan comes next time, he will bring a team of three hundred people, mainly composed of blacksmiths and carpenters. Their wages will be paid by Crescent Moon Bay, and Roland only needs to provide accommodation and food. The steam engines they produce in ten years will first be sold to Crescent Moon Bay, and after ten years, they can voluntarily decide whether to stay or go—this was a clause that Roland negotiated repeatedly to obtain.



Without a doubt, this group will definitely include trusted members of the caravan, and even after adding this clause, the other party will inevitably select those most loyal to Crescent Moon Bay. It's uncertain if even half of them will choose to stay when the time comes. But for Roland, skilled workers are always in short supply, and retaining even ten percent would be a gain. He's never worried about losing his technological edge; his concern has always been about having enough people to turn his technology into actual products.



Besides steam engines, the second big order was for ship modifications.



Along with the three hundred craftsmen, two inland river sailboats will also be brought, and the Crescent Moon Bay caravan hopes that Border Town will convert them into steam-powered paddle wheelers. The modification fee for a single ship is as high as 1,800 Gold Royals, and the two together exceed the steam engine order from Margaret. Compared to this, the mug, although receiving three orders, totaled less than 300 Gold Royals—and that's after Roland marked up the price ten times that of the convenience store. This made him sigh at the profit margin difference between industrial and consumer goods; if mass production is not achievable, consumer goods might as well just meet the needs of the town's residents.



What surprised the prince was the cold reception of iron breastplates and iron farming tools. It was Margaret who clarified his confusion during dinner, "Although your breastplates are indeed cheaper, the production is too low. Reselling them, after deducting transportation costs and taxes, might only profit five or six Gold Royals per piece. Moreover, your armor is made by water-powered hammers or perhaps steam engines... In any case, the price of such armor is very fixed, expensive because of the quality of the iron used, not the labor." She paused, "There's also no point in buying it for personal use. Sea merchants, whether guards or sailors, rarely wear heavy iron armor, as it would cause them to sink quickly if they fall into the water. In most cases, armor is more of a shackle for them than protection."



"The same goes for farming tools. Unless you can obtain a large amount of cheap iron, they won't be too cheap, and compared to the local equivalent goods, it's hard to form any advantage. Unlike those colorful mugs, whose prices are completely variable. If a noble who likes them comes along, you might make several times the profit."



"So that's how it is." Roland thought about it and found it to be true... For goods like armor and farm tools, whose prices are stable, it's difficult to push the price down too much when material costs are the major factor—his advantage lies in the steam engine forging press being more efficient than the water hammer, but sadly, this small price difference is not enough to interest the big merchants.

Moreover, the whiteboard armor paired with Soria's anti-stab coating was also a part of the First Army's re-equipment. Before the production of iron could be increased, it was impossible to sell in large quantities.



...

The much-anticipated premiere of the play arrived quickly.

In the afternoon, the townsfolk crowded the central square to the point where it was packed—this was even after Roland had demolished the surrounding dilapidated buildings and doubled the size of the square.

To serve a promotional purpose, Roland had started posting public notices a week in advance, notifying the citizens, and he even specially ordered the Department of Agriculture to send people to the living areas on the outskirts of the town to mobilize serfs to watch the play.

As the lord, Roland obviously had the best viewing position. Facing the performance stage, Karl had set up a temporary wooden platform, which had three rows that could accommodate about a hundred people; Roland sat right in the middle of the third level. On one side was the Witch Union, with Anna sitting close to him, and on the other side were the merchant groups, with Margie being the closest to him.

The first and second levels were mostly occupied by officials from the city hall and apprentices.

To ensure safety, the soldiers from the First Army surrounded the wooden platform. While they watched the play, they separated the prince's location from the common people.



At about four in the afternoon, the scorching heat of the sun had faded, and with the occasional cool breeze brought about by Wendy, everyone in the viewing stand enjoyed VIP-like treatment.



Amidst the applause from the audience, the actors made their appearances one by one.



To be honest, Roland had no idea what the outcome of this premiere would be. After handing over the script to Irene, he hadn't interfered with the matter, leaving the recruitment, rehearsals, and all to her and Ferlin. Thinking back, how much experience could a theater newbie, who had only appeared on stage once, possibly have? And her friends were probably all bit actors who couldn't get performance opportunities at the fortress theater and had turned to the small town instead.



In other words, this was a new drama directed, choreographed, and executed entirely by newcomers.



Fortunately, Roland didn't mind failure. The drama was not for ticket revenue, nor to boast about the script's excellence. It was an enlightenment for ideological transformation, and it wasn't just a one-time performance. If this performance wasn't great, it would be fine as long as there was improvement next time.



"I understand now why you have so much confidence in this show," Margaret suddenly exclaimed in admiration. "You've actually invited Miss May!"



Roland paused, "Who?"



"May! Don't tell me you don't know about this! My goodness, I saw her perform in the capital before I came here," Margaret smacked her lips and said, "Whether it's her grasp of the character or the creation of emotion, she is top-notch. 'The Prince's Love Quest' has harvested who knows how many people's tears, even Kajen Fels has been full of praise for her!"



"Kajen Fels? Who is that?" Roland flipped through his memories and found no impression of this name in his mind.



"...Your Highness, are you really from the capital?" Margaret blinked, "If I may be so bold, who is the person you're most familiar with in the capital? Aside from those in the palace."



"'Devil's Hand' Yorko," Roland blurted out, immediately realizing his mistake.



"Oh," the female merchant looked at him meaningfully, "the most famous playboy, rumored to make women unforgettable with just his hands... I see."



"Just with his hands?" Anna turned her head, "Why?"



"No... It's nothing." Roland held his forehead, "Let's just focus on the play."
