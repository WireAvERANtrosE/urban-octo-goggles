## "The show has begun!"
After an on-site inspection of North Slope Mine and two days of continuous negotiations, Roland reached a new trade agreement with Hogg and the Crescent Moon Bay caravan.



Upon seeing the swiftly operating rail transport system for the mine, Hogg's eyes nearly popped out of his head. He even proposed investing money to build a factory in Border Town, specifically for manufacturing mining rails and equipment, with the profits to be split equally between them. However, Roland rejected the offer—enticing investment is something to do when there are plenty of people around; what the town currently lacks is people, not money.



Hogg, after all, was just a mining businessman. Although he owned several mines and managed an open-pit silver mine for Earl Campbell in Silver City, he could only bring out miners from under his command. His strength was far less compared to that of Crescent Moon Bay, which owned an entire island. In the end, the contract he signed was for the purchase of steam engines, ten of them, to be delivered six months later, as well as a complete mining transport system (including rails and mine carts), with half to be delivered before the Evil Months and the rest to be completed in the following year.



The Crescent Moon Bay caravan was much more ambitious in their demands. Gamol directly signed a ten-year agreement. When the caravan next arrived, he would bring along a team of three hundred people, mainly composed of blacksmiths and carpenters. Their wages would be paid by Crescent Moon Bay, with Roland only needing to provide accommodation and food. The steam engines they produced over the ten years would be sold to Crescent Moon Bay with priority, and after ten years, they could voluntarily decide whether to stay or leave—a term that Roland negotiated after much discussion.



Without a doubt, there would certainly be the caravan's trusted people among this group, and even after adding this term, the other party would inevitably select those who were loyal to Crescent Moon Bay. By the time they decided to stay, it was unknown if even half would remain. But for Roland, skilled workers were always in short supply, and keeping even ten percent would be a gain. He was never worried about the technological advantage, but rather worried about having no one to turn his technology into actual products.



Besides steam engines, the second big order was for ship modification.



The two river sailboats that came with the three hundred craftsmen were brought by the Crescent Moon Bay caravan in the hope that Border Town would retrofit them into steam-powered paddle boats. The cost of converting a single boat was as high as one thousand eight hundred Gold Royals, and the total for two boats exceeded Margie's steam engine order. By comparison, the mug orders, although amounting to three, totaled less than three hundred Gold Royals—even after Roland increased the price tenfold compared to that of the convenience store. This made him reflect on the profit margins of industrial products versus consumer goods; if mass production couldn't be achieved, consumer goods might as well just satisfy the needs of the town's residents.



What surprised the prince was the cold reception towards the iron breastplates and iron farming tools. It wasn't until dinner that Margie cleared up his confusion. "Although your breastplates are indeed a bit cheaper, the production is too low. If resold, each piece might only profit five or six Gold Royals after subtracting transportation costs and taxes. Plus, your armor is made with a water-powered hammer, right? Or maybe by steam engine... Either way, the price of such armor is very fixed, and the high cost lies in the quality of the iron used, not the labor." She paused, "It's even more unnecessary to buy for personal use. Seafarers, whether guards or sailors, rarely wear heavy iron armor; it would cause them to sink quickly if they fall overboard. In most cases, armor is more like shackles to them, not protection."



"The same goes for farming tools; unless you can obtain large quantities of cheap iron, they won't be much cheaper, and it's hard to compete with local products of the same kind. Unlike those colorful cups, their prices are completely unfixed. If you encounter a noble who likes them, you might be able to make several times the profit."



"Indeed." Roland thought about it and realized that this was the case... For commodities with stable prices such as armor and farm tools, where material costs accounted for a large part of the price, it was difficult to reduce the price too much—his advantage lay in the steam engine's forging press being more efficient than the water hammer, but unfortunately, this small price difference was not enough to interest the big merchants.

Moreover, the whiteboard armor paired with Soraya's anti-stab coating was also a part of the First Army's re-equipment. Before the production of iron increased, it was impossible to sell them in large quantities.

...

The much-anticipated premiere of the play arrived quickly.

In the afternoon, the townspeople crowded the central square to the point of bursting—at this point even after Roland had demolished the surrounding old buildings and doubled the size of the square.

To serve as publicity, Roland had begun posting notices a week in advance to inform the subjects, and he specifically ordered the Agriculture Department to send people to the residential areas on the outskirts of the town to mobilize the serfs to watch the play.

As the lord, Roland obviously had the best viewing position. Facing the performance stage, Karl had set up a temporary wooden platform with three rows that could accommodate about a hundred people, and Roland sat in the middle of the third layer. Beside him were the Witch Union, with Anna sitting close to him, and on the other side were the merchant groups, with the closest being Margaret.

The first and second layers were mostly occupied by the officials from the City Hall and apprentices.

To ensure safety, the soldiers from the First Army surrounded the wooden platform. While they watched the play, they separated the prince's location from the commoners.



It was probably around four in the afternoon, with the burning heat of the sun having faded away. Coupled with the cool breezes occasionally conjured by Wendy, everyone on the viewing platform was enjoying VIP-level treatment.

Amidst the sound of applause, the actors one by one stepped onto the stage.

To be honest, Roland had no idea what to expect from this premiere. After handing the script over to Irene, he had not interfered with the matter, leaving the recruiting and rehearsing to her and Philip. Now thinking about it, a newcomer to the theater, who had only made one appearance on stage, how much experience could they have? And the friends she had brought in were probably all minor actors who couldn't find opportunities to perform in the stronghold's theaters and had thus come to the small town.

In other words, this was a new play directed, choreographed, and implemented entirely by newcomers.

Fortunately, Roland didn't mind if it failed. This play wasn't for the sake of ticket revenue, nor was it to boast about the excellence of the script. This was a form of enlightenment for ideological transformation, and it was not going to be performed just once. If this performance wasn't good, it would be fine as long as there was improvement next time.

"I see why you're so confident about this performance now," Margaret suddenly exclaimed in surprise, "You've actually invited Miss May!"

Roland blinked, "Who?"

"May, don't tell me you don't know about this! My goodness, I saw her perform in the capital before I came here," Margaret smacked her lips, "Whether it's her grasp of the character or the creation of emotion, she's top-notch. 'The Prince's Love Quest' has earned who knows how many people's tears, even Kajen Fels has nothing but praise for her!"

"Kajen Fels? Who's that?" Roland flipped through his memories, finding no impression of that name in his mind.



"...Your Highness, are you really from the capital?" Margaret blinked, "If I may ask, who are you most familiar with in the capital? Aside from those in the palace."



"Devil's Hand, Yorko." Roland blurted out, immediately realizing his mistake.



"Oh," the female merchant gave him a meaningful look, "The most famous playboy, said to make women unable to forget him with just his hands alone... I see."



"Just with his hands?" Anna turned her head, "Why?"



"No... It's nothing." Roland massaged his forehead, "Let's just focus on the play."
