## Formal Talks
After Tilly left the office, Roland let out a sigh of relief.



It was obviously a great pressure to spout nonsense with a straight face in front of a clever person, especially when he had to maintain a sincere and earnest expression throughout. Fortunately, Nightingale's report gave him a chance to catch his breath—the witches from Sleeping Island had all returned to the castle, and Roland took the opportunity to end the conversation.



"How does it feel, facing your own witch sister? Do you have a special feeling?" Nightingale flipped over and sat on the table, looking down at the prince from a height.



The latter rolled his eyes and said grumpily, "Does feeling stressed count as a special feeling?"



"I thought it would be a deeply touching reunion," she said with a curl of her lip.



"I didn't get along with her," Roland sighed, "I used to bully her a lot in the palace, and after growing up, she was no different from a stranger. It's already a pleasant surprise that she came here."



"Oh?" she said meaningfully, "You wouldn't spend time alone with any other strange witches, but I see you trust her quite a bit."



Because I don't want you to see me lying, Roland didn't answer, refilling his tea cup and slowly sipping from it as he leaned back in his chair.



"Anyway... you'll understand in time."



Nightingale reached out to touch his lips, "You will tell me everything, right?"

"…Yes."

"I'll take that promise," she chuckled, and then disappeared in front of Roland.

Roland leaned back in his chair, recalling the entire conversation, looking for any possible flaws—this was also the 'most suitable' explanation he could think of. Years of experience told him that the more lies one fabricates, the less they hold up to scrutiny. So the excuses of feigning ignorance in childhood, accidentally finding ancient books, or being taught by a hermit would be hard to maintain under further questioning. Besides being his sister, she was also the leader of the witch organization, and any lie exposed before a stable alliance was formed would heavily damage their trust.



So he chose to tell the truth about details that could be exposed, attributing any additional knowledge to sudden memories—even though it sounded incredibly unbelievable, it was at least less negative than the even more unbelievable idea of transmigration and could not be disproven. If it were the latter, it was uncertain whether she could accept a completely foreign visitor from another world.



As long as he insisted on his identity as the fourth prince of Greycastle, no one could deny it. And what she wanted was probably just an explanation from his own mouth. Roland was clear in his mind that a good leader wouldn't dwell on the past; moving forward together was what mattered most. If he could show her the vast prospects of the Western Territory this winter, along with his sincere wish to cooperate, it would be a successful meeting. As for their relationship, there would be plenty of time to mend it in the future.



In the evening, a grand banquet was held in the castle hall.



The common pepper steak, fried eggs, and white bread were not worth mentioning, but an array of spirits, sautéed bird's beak mushrooms, steamed buns, and ice cream made their appearance, elevating the taste of the dishes to a whole new level. At the same time, the concept of fancy plating was introduced, with a large porcelain dish containing just a small piece of the main dish drenched in sauce, creating an excellent visual effect that made one's mouth water at first sight.



Among the clinking of glasses and the flickering candlelight, the dinner finally concluded in a warm and lively atmosphere.



The more formal discussions followed next.



In the reception room, with the fireplace burning vigorously, Roland and the members of the Witch Union sat in a row at the long table, while Tilly and the witches of Sleeping Island sat opposite them. Maggie, due to the sensitivity of her identity, simply transformed into a pigeon and perched on the chandelier overhead.



Tilly was the first to speak, "In addition to wanting to help Border Town fend off the demonic beast invasion, I also plan to take back the five witches I previously sent over," she briefly recounted the recent situation on Sleeping Island, "Next spring, Silvermoon Bay will have a group of ordinary people moving into the island, and the extra housing and food will need to be addressed by Lotus and Honey."



Roland felt a headache coming on. Fending off the demonic beasts could be managed by the First Army, and except for the agile hybrid types, there was almost no need for witches to take action. However, when it came to construction, the role of the witches was irreplaceable. The mountain pass to the harbor had yet to be opened, the shipyard was only half-built, and he wanted to construct several more batches of cave dwellings, "Can you wait for another half a month?"



"I would like to agree, but the situation has changed," Tilly shook her head helplessly, "Mutated sea ghosts have appeared off the southern cape, which you can think of as a kind of aquatic demonic beast. I suspect all this is related to the early arrival of the Evil Months. Legend has it that the longer the Evil Months last, the more ferocious and terrifying the demonic beasts become, so it's safer for them to start their journey earlier."



"They are not suited for battle."



"I know, which is why Wind will accompany the ship—her ability is very effective against foes of low intelligence. Moreover, we do not plan to return by the same route, but rather travel along the coastline northward until reaching Clearwater Harbor, then take the usual commercial routes to Sleeping Island. According to the avian messengers, there have been no demonic beast sightings on the routes between the fjords and the kingdom."



Roland could only make a final effort, "Er... Apart from Lotus and Honey, could the other three possibly stay? Primary education has just reached the halfway point, leaving now would be like abandoning it halfway..."



"Pfft," Tilly couldn't help but laugh out loud, "It seems you've grown quite fond of them."



"..." He didn't know how to respond to that remark for a moment.

"I want to ask, how do you utilize the power of Candle and Evelyn?" 

"Solidifying metal parts and brewing, the former greatly improves the efficiency of machinery operation, and the latter..." Roland paused slightly, "Alcohol is a very good thing, it has many uses besides drinking."

"And they were always worried on Sleeping Island that their abilities would be useless and often would..." Tilly didn't continue, but Roland guessed it must be related to discrimination, just like what Miya experienced in the Mutual Aid Society, "I'm very happy to hear you retain them like this. Indeed, every witch has her own unique role, and their abilities are not meaningless," she looked towards Evelyn and the others, "What are your thoughts?"

"I wish to follow you, Lady Tilly," said Sylvie.

"I..." Candle touched her head, "Anywhere is fine."

"Lady Tilly, if you need me, I will return to Sleeping Island," Evelyn replied after a moment of silence, "Other than that, I want to continue staying in Border Town. I... still have a lot to learn from Teacher Scroll."

"There's no need to be so nervous, I'm not making you choose to stay or leave—it's not a question of either-or," Tilly said with a smile and a shake of her head, "I just wanted to understand how you've been getting on in the town. You can return to Sleeping Island at any time, and Lotus and Honey will likely not leave and never come back. I even want to invite the witches from Border Town to visit Sleeping Island. I hope that through our efforts, in the future, whether it's the Northern Region or the Southern Territory, witches can live freely. Do you think I'm right? Brother."

Roland was slightly startled, this was the first time he heard her address him so openly, even with the memories of the Fourth Prince, it had been over a decade. He revealed a smile and nodded, "There will be such a day."
