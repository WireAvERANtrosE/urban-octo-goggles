## Encounter
Damn it, damn it! What kind of prince is that, isn't he just a poor wretch thrown into the wild mountains? Baron Cole thought viciously, but considering the two guards who were following him with hands on the hilts of their swords, he had to swallow his anger for the time being.



Stepping out of the castle gate and seeing the guards turn away and leave, the baron finally breathed a sigh of relief.



He pulled out a damp handkerchief to wipe his forehead, spat fiercely, and imagined the spit hitting the prince's face. That alone wasn't enough to relieve his anger, so he stomped on the spit twice more, feeling somewhat better.



So what if you stopped the demonic beasts, do you think you can gain a foothold in the Western Territory? Keep being smug for now, let's see how long you can keep it up! Baron Cole thought to himself. If it weren't for the reliable information he received, he wouldn't have come to Border Town so early. Normally, nobles would return to the town later than commoners. After all, the hard and tiring work of mining and hunting wasn't something they needed to do. They just needed to supervise the mines every so often and wait for the days when the ore was delivered. In their spare time, they could also visit the hunter's home to see if there were any high-quality furs worth buying.



But this year, things have changed. Baron Cole heard from the financial steward, Lord Ferlin, that the Duke of Lion planned to drive the fourth prince out of the Western Territory—this was not a betrayal of the Kingdom of Greycastle, but in accordance with the will of the new king, Timothy Wimbledon: "Roland Wimbledon is no longer the lord of Border Town, and his new fief will need to be re-granted after he returns to the capital to report."



Lord Ferlin is a favored man in front of the duke, having climbed from a municipal officer to the position of financial steward in just five years. If not for the relationship with a distant relative, sending him two fine furs every year, how could he himself know the thoughts of the ruler of the Western Territory?



"Returning to the capital to report and re-granting the fief" is just a euphemism. Even Baron Cole knew that the eldest prince was sent to the guillotine without a second word. The fourth prince returning this time, wouldn't he just be at the mercy of the new king?



Without a doubt, the Western Territory belongs to the duke. If it were just a unilateral order from His Majesty Timothy, that would be negotiable. However, once the duke himself is prepared to take action, Roland Wimbledon is no different from a stray dog.



This is also why Baron Cole hurried to Border Town. Firstly, he wanted to gather some furs early, and secondly, he planned to sell off his house. His calculation for the first point was very astute. In previous years, the commoners here would flee to Longsong Stronghold for refuge, naturally leaving no goods behind, but this year they stayed, so he ought to be able to collect a few decent furs, right? Not only could he make a small profit, but he could also offer a portion as a tribute to Lord Ferlin.



The second point was that Cole had asked Lord Ferlin to arrange a position for him in the City Hall. Although it was a sinecure, it was still better than this damned poor place. Since the house was no longer needed, it was of course best to sell it off as soon as possible. Who knew when the Duke would make his move, and if those lowly commoners accidentally burned down his house during their resistance, that would be a huge loss.



But what he never expected was that his house wouldn't be burned down by the commoners, but rather directly dismantled by the Fourth Prince. At this thought, Baron Cole felt so angry that his teeth itched—the house was of such good quality! Although one hundred and fifty Gold Royals might have been an exaggeration, it was certainly worth thirty Gold Royals.



In order to get the money sooner, he kept lowering his price. He could reluctantly accept twenty Gold Royals, but His Highness treated him like this! Not a single coin was offered, and he was even threatened with the crime of desertion. Didn't he know that every year during the Evil Months, all the nobles would evacuate from this place?



Wait a minute... Cole slowed his pace, suddenly feeling that something was amiss. Although he had heard that the Fourth Prince had a nasty character and acted recklessly, and that when he first arrived in Border Town he even maliciously harassed Baron Simon's wife, becoming the subject of private jokes for a long time, the feeling he got from meeting him today was completely different. The prince did not fly into a rage or act shamelessly in denial; the demeanor he showed was not at all consistent with someone who was nasty or reckless. He had always spoken to him in a normal tone, so why was he so frightened at that time that he willingly gave up the ownership of the house? Could it be that if he insisted the house was his, His Highness the Prince could really kill him?



That's right... Cole couldn't help shivering, and the sweat on his forehead retracted. Now that he thought about it, when he faced the prince, he had an illusion that he was talking to the Duke himself.



Baron Cole shook his head vigorously, trying to throw this unpleasant memory to the back of his mind. Anyway, the Fourth Prince wouldn't be pleased for long. When Lord Lion took back Border Town and escorted Roland Wimbledon to the capital, he would have to mock him properly. Maybe, he could even ask the Duke to seek justice for his twenty Gold Royals.



With this thought, he relaxed again. Since he had received several good pieces of fur, he didn't need to sell the house anymore and decided to simply return to the stronghold. That talk about "informing other nobles who might have the same misunderstanding" was simply too pretentious. Once he returned to Longsong Stronghold, he would have to imitate and let everyone hear it, to let them see what a bluffer was really like.



Leaving the castle district and walking down the slope, Cole brushed past a woman wearing a hood.



Normally, this was not something surprising. Among the townspeople who came and went, the women all dressed like this. To see beautiful young ladies or noblewomen, one would have to go to the capital. But when a gust of wind lifted a corner of the woman's hood, Cole's heart skipped a beat, and the air around him seemed to freeze.



My god, what kind of woman was that, with her rare emerald green long hair, her beauty was striking even just at a glance, and even if placed among the princesses and noble ladies of Greycastle's capital, she would make them pale in comparison. How could such a person appear in Border Town?



He turned his head, wanting to catch up and see her clearly, but he found that she was heading towards the castle district.



Is she one of His Highness the Prince's women? The baron hesitated for a moment but ultimately chose to give up. He really did not want to deal with the Fourth Prince any longer. It was better to leave such a villain to the duke to deal with, and for himself to return to the stronghold as soon as possible.



Boarding his own single-masted swift boat at the dock, the boatman hoisted the sail, and the small boat quickly left the pier, heading in the direction of Longsong Stronghold.



On the return trip, while sitting at the bow of the boat basking in the sun, Corlys saw an astonishing sight.



About five miles from Border Town in the snowy field, a large group of people appeared in his view—they were wearing the same dark brown leather armor, carrying long wooden spears on their backs, marching in a long column, slowly making their way through the snow. Although they were obscured by a layer of forest and he couldn’t see the full extent of the troop, there were at least a hundred people.



Are these... the farmers the Fourth Prince is using to fight against the demonic beasts?



In the early days of the month when the snow had not yet melted, the roads were nearly deserted, and Corlys could imagine how difficult it was to trek through the snow without having tried it himself. Yet these people all had their heads down, hurrying on their way as if the nearly one-foot-deep snow beneath their feet was nothing...



He wanted to scoff, but he found that he couldn't laugh. A question unconsciously rose from the bottom of his heart—could the knights under Lord Lion accomplish this feat?
