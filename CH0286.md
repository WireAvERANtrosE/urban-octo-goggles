## "Transformation"
The real big brother.

The real... big brother? How is that possible?

Tilly stared blankly at the letter, her mind completely unable to focus, thoughts swirling like a tide.

Among the five children of Father Wimbledon III, Herman, Timothy, and Grace, being born earlier, formed one circle. By the time Roland was born, the youngest Grace was already six years old, naturally, they wouldn't include him in their play. Logically, she should have formed another circle with Roland, but... that was not the case.

Her brother yearned to be a part of the circle of his two older brothers, trying hard to fit in, often ending up as the one being bullied. This caused Roland's personality to become twisted and irritable, and of course, he didn't dare to direct this anger towards Herman and the others, so it ended up being vented onto her.

For instance, he would instigate her to steal their father's crown together, and upon refusal, he would inevitably become furiously ashamed and lash out with insults, sometimes even with fists and kicks. Later, when their father discovered this, he severely reprimanded Roland, who then restrained himself quite a bit, but he still frequently made small threatening gestures towards her.

These things might have been incomprehensible at the time, but looking back now, Tilly only found them to be quite laughable and... childish.

It wasn't until she was ten years old, when she found a worm cut into pieces inside her beloved shoes, that she could no longer bear it and decided to fight back. She called Roland over and, as he began to threaten her, she stuffed the worm directly into his mouth—since then, he never again took the initiative to provoke her, and she too had no wish to interact with this brother anymore.

After reaching adulthood, Roland still hadn't changed at all; in fact, he became even worse. She often heard about his profligate deeds, and in the rumors among the nobles, he was described as irritable, harsh, and ignorant, the least noble-like of all nobles, possessing nothing but his royal status. Tilly deeply agreed with this assessment... and she also knew that his irritability and anger were nothing but a façade to cover up his biggest weakness—cowardice and timidity.



Yet such a man would stand on the side of witches, protect a group of beings called the devil's minions, and even dare to make enemies of the Church?

Tilly didn't know what to say for a moment.

"Tilly, Tilly?" It wasn't until Ashes shook her that she came back to her senses.

"I'm fine, just a bit... unbelievable," she shook her head, "Sylvie said that the lord of Border Town is very likely to be the real Roland Wimbledon, not someone controlled or replaced by witches."

"Hmm, that foolish—*cough cough*—guy who tried to lay his hands on me?" Ashes coughed twice, "He has indeed changed astonishingly. It's only been a year since I last saw him, and other than his appearance being almost the same as in my memory, I feel like I'm looking at a completely different person."

"Can you be more specific?"

Ashes tilted her head and thought for a while, "I think... the biggest difference is probably cleanliness."

"Cleanliness?"

"Whether it's his attire... or the impression he gives off. He doesn't have a preference for jewelry like other nobles do; there's not a single piece of gold, silver, or gemstone on him," Ashes recalled, "Even his clothes are very ordinary, they look rather loose, without any lace, hanging decorations, or gold threads. If it weren't for his notably striking hair color, he would almost be indistinguishable from an ordinary person. But then... he's completely unlike an ordinary person."



"Like a noble?" Tilly asked.



"No, even less like a noble," Ashes curled her lip, "Not a single noble is clean, either they are stagnant water, or the silt that lies beneath it. As for him... I can't exactly put it into words, but overall, he gives off a not so bad impression."



"It's hard to believe you would speak for him."



"Er, I'm just trying to seriously answer your question."



Tilly exhaled, it seemed that her brother had indeed changed a lot, but what exactly had caused this transformation? Or was it due to some reasons she could not probe, which made him unknowingly become a different person?



The Fifth Princess suddenly remembered Roland's first letter — "For this, I must destroy the entire Church, dispel the notion that witches are evil, and rescue all people from foolishness and ignorance. This is a long process, I need more of your assistance. As for what made me decide this, and what made me no longer indifferent to everything as I was before, these trivial matters can be slowly elaborated on when there is a chance."



Perhaps only by meeting him in person could she understand the real reason behind it all.



Pushing these thoughts aside, Tilly turned her attention back to the letter.



The latter part was about what Sylvie had seen and heard in Border Town.



It turned out that Roland had chosen her for the purpose of exploring mineral resources, but in the North Slope Mine, they discovered a massive deposit of God's Stone of Retaliation—these stones, which could suppress a witch's power, grew from the ground just like any other ore. This meant that the Holy City of Hermes must also control such a vein, capable of continuously producing God's Stone of Retaliation.



Further down, another piece of information caught her attention.



A weapon that could fire iron balls and bolts from a metal tube, with immense power and accompanied by a deafening roar... Although Maggie and Ashes had mentioned such a thing, this was the first time she saw such a detailed description, complete with a hand-drawn illustration below the text.



"Oh? So this is what the thing that injured me looks like," Ashes leaned in, "Since he's an ally, you might as well ask him to send a batch of weapons to Sleeping Island in your reply, and say it's to guard against the Church. If he's unwilling... hmm, this ally might not be as reliable as you think."



"Alliances don't mean there's no need for caution," Tilly said with a smile, "Such a weapon is clearly the foundation of his security; how could he easily hand it over to others. Such a probe would only destroy the hard-earned trust—we didn't even include Molly and Echo in the list of witches' abilities that I gave him. Besides, we're going to Border Town this winter anyway. It’s better to discuss it in person, isn't it?"



"Alright then," Ashes shrugged, "You're the boss."



Tilly smiled and continued reading the letter.



When her eyes reached the end of the letter, she was stunned.



Roland had actually invented an undergarment for wrapping around women's breasts and was treating it as a gift for every adult female member of the Witch Union? This was simply absurd! Giving intimate clothing was something only lovers would do; how could he—wait a minute, Tilly suddenly remembered that when he was in the King's City, he had also given some noble ladies corsets, a few of which had been thrown back in his face, becoming a laughingstock among the nobility for a time.



This is indeed something he would do!



Tilly suddenly felt conflicted. On one hand, he now matched the image she had of him in her memories, but on the other hand, she felt it might be better if he didn't.



Should she go to Border Town to see him in the winter? The fifth princess was plunged into distress.
