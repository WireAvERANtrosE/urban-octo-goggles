## "Transformation"
My true brother.

My true... brother? How is that possible?

Tilly stared blankly at the letter, her thoughts utterly scattered, swirling like a tide in her mind.

Among the five children of Father Wimbledon III, Herman, Timothy, and Grace, born earlier, formed one circle. By the time Roland was born, the youngest Grace was already six years old and naturally would not include him in their play. Logically, she should have formed another circle with Roland, but... that was not the case.

Her brother yearned to be part of the circle of his two older brothers, striving to fit in, often ending up as the one bullied. This caused Roland's personality to become twisted and irritable, and of course, he did not dare to vent his anger towards Herman and the others, so it all came down on her.

For example, he would coax her into stealing their father's crown, and upon being rejected, he would inevitably erupt in an angry tirade of insults, sometimes even coming to blows. Later, when discovered by their father, he was severely punished and consequently became somewhat restrained, but he still engaged in various small acts to intimidate her.

These things might have been incomprehensible at the time, but looking back now, Tilly found them quite ridiculous and... childish.

It all came to a head when she was ten and found a worm, cut into several pieces, in her beloved shoes. Unable to endure it any longer, she decided to fight back. She called Roland over and, as he began to threaten her, she stuffed the worm directly into his mouth—after that, he never bothered her again, and she had no desire to interact with this brother further.

As an adult, Roland had not changed at all, in fact, he became even worse. She often heard of his profligate tales; among the nobility, he was known for his temper, meanness, and ignorance, considered the least noble-like noble, with nothing to his name but his royal status. Tilly agreed deeply with this assessment... and she knew all too well that his temper and irritability were but a facade to cover his greatest weakness—cowardice and timidity.



However, such a person would actually stand on the side of witches, shelter a group called the devil's minions, and even be willing to go against the church?

Tilly didn't know what to say for a moment.

"Tilly, Tilly?" It wasn't until Ashes shook her twice that she came back to her senses.

"I'm okay, just a bit... unbelievable," she shook her head, "Sylvie said that the lord of Border Town is very likely the real Roland Wimbledon, not someone controlled by witches or replaced."

"Um, that foolish—cough cough, the guy who tried to lay his hands on me?" Ashes coughed twice, "He has indeed changed astonishingly. It's only been a year since we last met, and aside from his appearance being almost the same as I remember, I feel like I'm looking at a completely different person."

"Can you be more specific?"

Ashes tilted her head and thought for a while, "I think... the biggest difference should be that he's clean."

"Clean?"

"Whether it's his dressing... or the impression he gives. He doesn't favor jewelry like other nobles, there is not a single piece of gold, silver, or gem on him," Ashes recalled, "Even his clothes are very ordinary in style, looking rather loose, without lace, pendants, or gold thread. If it wasn't for his striking hair color, he would almost be indistinguishable from an ordinary person. But... he's completely unlike an ordinary person."



"Like a noble?" Tilly asked.



"No, less like a noble," Ashes pursed her lips, "No noble is clean, they are either stagnant water or the mud covered beneath it. As for him... I can't quite put it into words, but overall, he gives off a not so bad feeling."



"It's hard to believe you would speak on his behalf."



"Uh, I just wanted to seriously answer your question."



Tilly exhaled, it seemed her brother had indeed changed a lot, but what exactly caused this transformation? Was it because of some reasons she couldn't probe, that he unknowingly became another person?



The Fifth Princess suddenly remembered Roland's first letter—"For this, I must destroy the entire Church, dispel the notion that witches are evil, and free all the people from their foolish and ignorant ways. It is a long process, and I will need your assistance even more. As for what made me make this decision, and what makes me no longer indifferent to everything like I used to be, these trivial matters can be discussed in detail when there's a chance."



Perhaps only by meeting him in person, could she know the real reasons behind it all.



Tilly brought her thoughts back and refocused on the letter.



The latter part was about what Sylvie had seen and heard in Border Town.



The reason Roland chose her was to explore the mineral resources, but in the North Slope mine, they discovered a massive amount of Divine Stones of Judgement—it turns out that these stones, which can suppress witches' powers, grow from the ground just like other minerals. This means that the Holy City of Hermes must also control such a vein, capable of producing an endless supply of Divine Stones of Judgement.

Further down, another piece of news caught her attention.

A weapon capable of firing iron balls and crossbow bolts through iron tubes, with immense power and accompanied by deafening roars... Although Maggie and Ashes had both mentioned such a thing, this was her first time seeing such a detailed description, even including a hand-drawn illustration below the text.

"Oh? So this is what the thing that wounded me looks like," Ashes leaned over, "Since he is an ally, you can simply ask him to send a batch of weapons to Sleeping Island in your reply letter, saying it's for defense against the Church. If he's unwilling... hmm, this ally might not be as reliable as you think."

"Being allies doesn't mean being completely unguarded," Tilly said with a smile, "Such a weapon is clearly his means of security, how could he easily hand it over to someone else. Such a probe would only destroy the trust that was not easy to build—I didn't include Moly and Echo in the list of witches' abilities I gave to him either. Besides, we're going to Border Town this winter anyway, so it's better to discuss it in person, right?"

"Alright," Ashes shrugged, "You make the decisions."

Tilly smiled and continued reading the letter.

When her eyes reached the end of the letter, she was stunned.

Roland had actually invented a kind of undergarment for wrapping women's breasts and was giving it as a gift to every adult female member of the Witch Union? This was utterly absurd! Giving intimate clothing is something that lovers would do—how could he—wait, Tilly suddenly remembered that when he was in the capital, he seemed to have also given some noble ladies corsets, some of which were directly thrown in people's faces, becoming a laughingstock among the nobility for a while.



This is indeed something he would do! Tilly instantly felt conflicted. On one hand, he now fit the image she had of him in her memory, but on the other hand, she felt that it might be better if he didn't fit that image.

Should she go to Border Town to see him in the winter? The Fifth Princess was plunged into distress.
