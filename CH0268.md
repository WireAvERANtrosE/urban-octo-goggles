## First General Assembly (Part 1)
Roland held the first high-level meeting for Border Town in the castle's reception hall.



Compared to the initial days when only Barov and his dozen or so apprentices were present, the town hall had grown to a group of nearly a hundred people—including destitute nobles, captured knights and their followers, and natives who had completed primary education and obtained graduation certificates.



Thanks to the population growth, various departments had been established one after another, making the town hall finally look a bit like what the prince had anticipated. He no longer had to do everything himself, as he did before. Now, he could hand down some simple policies and plans, and this nascent town hall could break down the tasks among the departments for completion, which filled Roland with satisfaction.



The participants in the first high-level meeting were all the heads of the departments, namely Minister of Agriculture Sini Daly, Minister of Education Scroll, acting head of the Chemical Department Kyle Sichi, Minister of Construction Karl Barton, military leader Iron Axe, and the town hall's chief steward Barov Mons. The Ministry of Industry was still managed personally by Roland, as no one else knew what industrialization actually looked like.



Each person had a bucket of ice water by their side, exuding bursts of cool air—the ice cubes in the buckets had been enchanted with candlelight and could last at least a morning when soaked in water. Even if the sun was scorching outside, the castle hall maintained a cool temperature.



"Let's have each department report on recent developments," Roland said, taking a pitcher from the bucket and pouring himself a cup of ice water. "Let's start with the Ministry of Agriculture."



"Yes, Your Highness." Sini stood up and bowed, then unfolded the scroll he had prepared in advance. "The amount of grain handed over this time is around 17,000 bushels, which alone can meet the needs of all the townspeople until next year's summer. In addition, as per your request, the Ministry of Agriculture has purchased the remaining grain at market price, but this amount is much less than the handed-over proportion, currently only 4,500 bushels."



The so-called "bushel" was the commonly used container for measuring wheat, a basket woven with bamboo strips, so the figure was just for reference—he had no idea how to convert it into kilograms or liters. Fortunately, this was not important. The key was knowing that the collected grain was enough to feed the townspeople.



The critical point was the second part. If calculated by the method of collecting seven-tenths and keeping three-tenths, the purchased grain should be around 7,000 bushels. The portion reserved for food and next year's seeds did not require that much. In other words, some of the serfs did not sell the remaining three-tenths of their grain to the town hall but chose to hoard it privately in their sheds.



Although he had anticipated such a situation, he still sighed lightly when it actually happened. The purpose of hoarding grain was obvious—it was to speculate and profiteer. If the town suffered from a shortage of grain supply or was struck by natural or man-made disasters, they could sell their stockpile for much higher than the market price, even up to tenfold or more.



This was why Roland had made grain trade a municipal monopoly, requiring buyers to show identification. The issue of grain was related to the most basic stability of Border Town; in the early days when food was not yet abundant, if the restrictions were lifted, it would be easy for people to buy in bulk and hoard, ultimately leading to a rise in grain prices. The purchase of a fixed quantity of grain with real-name registration, while banning other sales channels, was the only way to keep grain prices stable.



"Your Highness, why not forcibly buy the wheat from the serfs?" Barov asked, puzzled, "After all, the law does not allow them to sell to others."



"Because it is their private property, and how to dispose of it is their freedom," Roland replied, "I didn't stipulate that the serfs are not allowed to keep grain for themselves. You can also understand it as, unless expressly prohibited, it is allowed."



Barov looked a bit confused, seemingly unsure of how to understand this statement. Not just him, most people furrowed their brows, only Barov seemed to show a thoughtful expression.



"Is there anything else to report?" Roland took a sip of ice water, this concept of emphasizing rules and procedures would have to be grasped slowly by them in the future, or rather, only after understanding this could they be considered a qualified official of the new era. Of course, this system could easily go to another extreme, leading to the emergence of bureaucratism; but bureaucratism was still better than chaos, disorder, or reckless conduct.



"Uh... yes," Barov shook his head, "Now that the fields have all been harvested, how should the fallow plan for next year be arranged?"



"No, these lands will not be left fallow, continue to plant wheat next year," Roland waved his hand, "The manure piled at the edge of the fields is prepared to fertilize the land. Next, you guide the serfs to shovel it into the fields, mix it thoroughly with the soil, and continue to pile new manure in the emptied spots." The high temperature and humidity of summer only required two months for it to decompose, while in winter it took about four months. By the next spring, not only would the soil quality have been improved by the first batch of compost, but there would also be a new batch of compost that could be used as base fertilizer, making fallowing completely unnecessary.



Not to mention sophisticated fertilizers, just the application of human and animal waste to agricultural production was already a great improvement.



"Alright, if that's what you require," he said, touching his head, "Additionally... Your Highness, so much wheat can hardly be ground with just one or two stone mills. I would like to apply for the construction of a mill next to the Redwater River, preferably one powered by a steam engine."

"Agreed," Roland nodded, this was another new breakthrough—apart from himself, someone was finally beginning to attempt to use this new power, "You first submit the plan to Barov, and after obtaining the budget, work with the Construction Department to develop a detailed scheme."

"Yes, Your Highness," said Sini, "The last matter is the promotion of free citizens. This time, a total of five hundred and sixteen people have qualified for promotion. Since it was strictly divided on the spot according to the amount of wheat submitted, no objections were raised, and I have already reported the list to Lord Barov." He then rose again to salute, "My report is complete."

"Well done." Roland clapped his hands twice in encouragement. This young knight from the Wildflame clan now seemed to have adapted to the life in the town, and was also doing well in the City Hall. With a little packaging, he would be an excellent model for propaganda, which could play a significant role in the future when recruiting destitute nobles and knights from the fortresses.

The second to report was Scroll, her long hair pinned up behind her head, wearing a clean and tidy white shirt with a plain black skirt without any decorations or frills, looking mature and capable. It was hard to imagine that half a year ago, she was a witch in exile, who had to hide and flee from the Church.

"At the moment, a total of two batches have completed primary education, totaling eighty-five people, most of whom have studied at the academy founded by Mr. Karl." Her ability was eidetic memory, so she didn't need any preparation when reporting data, something that Roland quite envied, "Among them, forty-six people chose to work at the City Hall, twenty-one decided to go to the bicycle factory, thirteen applied to join the First Army," she paused here, "and five people signed up for positions in the chemical laboratory."

Five people? Roland couldn't help but look towards Kyle Sichi, whose complexion was obviously a bit unsightly. It seemed that the effect of the knighting ceremony as a form of propaganda was not as good as he expected. In this way, some of the three newly established laboratories might have to be idle for a while.

Fortunately, the employment rate was at least one hundred percent, he consoled himself.
