## First General Assembly (Part 1)
Roland held the first senior management meeting of Border Town in the castle's reception hall.



Compared to the beginning, when only Barov and his dozen or so apprentices were holding the fort, the City Hall has now grown into a massive group of nearly a hundred people—including down-and-out nobles, captured knights and their retinues, as well as natives who have completed primary education and obtained graduation certificates.



Thanks to the population growth, various departments have also been established one after another, making the City Hall finally look a bit like what the prince had been expecting. He no longer had to do everything himself as before. Now, some simple policies and plans could be delegated, and this budding City Hall could break down the tasks among the departments for completion, which was a source of great satisfaction for Roland.



The participants of the first senior management meeting were all heads of their respective departments, including Minister of Agriculture Sonny Dali, Minister of Education Scroll, interim head of the Chemical Industry Department Kyle Sichi (Kyle Steuer), Minister of Construction Karl Van Bate (Karl Barton), head of the Military Iron Axe, and the City Hall Supervisor Barov Mons. The Ministry of Industry was still directly managed by Roland himself, as no one else knew what industrialization actually looked like.



Each person had a bucket of ice water at their side, emitting bursts of cool air—the ice cubes in the buckets had been enchanted by candlelight and could last at least all morning when placed in the water. Even if the sun blazed fiercely outside, the temperature in the castle's great hall remained pleasantly cool.



"Let's have each department report on their recent situations," Roland said as he took a kettle out of the bucket and poured himself a cup of ice water, "starting with the Ministry of Agriculture."



"Yes, Your Highness." Sonny stood up and bowed, then spread out the scroll he had prepared in advance, "The grain submitted this time is around 17,000 bushels, which alone is enough to meet the food needs of all townspeople until next summer. In addition, as per your instructions, the Ministry of Agriculture purchased the remaining grain at market price, but this amount is much less than the submitted portion, currently only at 4,500 bushels."



The so-called "bushel" was a commonly used wheat measuring container, a basket woven from bamboo strips, so this figure was just to be heard, as he had no clear idea how to convert it into kilograms or liters—but that was not important. What mattered was that he knew the collected grain could feed the townspeople.



The key point was the second one: if calculated by the method of keeping seventy percent and selling thirty percent, the purchased grain should be around 7,000 bushels, and the part reserved for food and seeds for next year would not need that much. In other words, some serfs did not sell the remaining thirty percent of their grain to the City Hall but chose to hoard it in wooden sheds instead.



Although he had anticipated such a situation, it still made him sigh softly when it actually occurred. The purpose of hoarding grain was obvious—it was intended for speculation and profiteering—if the town experienced a shortage of grain supply, or if there were natural disasters or man-made calamities, they could sell the grain at a price much higher than the market rate, even up to more than ten times the price.



This was also why Roland made grain trade a municipal hall monopoly, and buyers had to show their identification cards. The issue of grain was related to the most basic stability of Border Town. In the early days when grain was not yet abundant, if sales were unrestricted, it would be easy for people to buy in large quantities and hoard them, eventually leading to a rise in grain prices. The real-name system for purchasing a set amount of grain, while banning other sales channels, could keep the grain prices stable.



"Your Highness, why not forcibly purchase the wheat from the serfs?" Sonny asked, puzzled, "After all, the laws do not allow them to sell to others."



"Because that is their private property, and how to dispose of it is their freedom," Roland replied, "I haven't stipulated that serfs are not allowed to keep grain for themselves. You can also understand it as, as long as it's not explicitly forbidden, it is allowed."



Sonny seemed a bit confused, as if he did not know how to interpret this statement. Not just him, most people furrowed their brows, only Barov seemed to have a thoughtful expression.



"Is there anything else to report?" Roland took a sip of ice water. This concept, which emphasized rules and procedures, would only be understood by them gradually or, rather, understanding this would qualify one as a competent official of the new era. Of course, this system was also prone to another extreme, leading to the emergence of bureaucracy, but bureaucracy was still better than chaos, disorder, or arbitrary action.



"Uh... yes," Sonny·Dali shook his head, "Now that the fields have been harvested, how should we arrange the fallow plan for next year?"



"No, these lands will not be fallowed. Next year we will continue to plant wheat," Roland waved his hand, "The manure piled up at the edge of the fields is prepared for fertilizing the land. Next, you guide the serfs to shovel it into the fields, thoroughly mixing it with the soil, and then continue to pile up new manure in the vacated spots." The high humidity of the summer only required two months for it to decompose, while in winter it took about four months. By next spring, not only would the soil quality have been improved by the first batch of compost, but he would also have a new batch of compost to use as base fertilizer, completely eliminating the need for fallowing.



Not to mention sophisticated chemical fertilizers, just the application of human and animal manure to agricultural production was already a significant improvement.



"Alright, if that is what you request." He touched his head, "Furthermore... Your Highness, I'm afraid relying on just one or two stone mills won't be enough to grind so much wheat. I would like to apply to build a mill beside the Redwater River, preferably one powered by steam engines."

"Granted," Roland nodded, this was another breakthrough—apart from himself, someone finally began to try using this new form of power, "You should first submit the plan to Barov, and after obtaining the funding, work with the Construction Department to develop a detailed proposal."

"Understood, Your Highness," Sonny replied, "The last item is about the promotion of commoners, a total of five hundred and sixteen people have qualified for promotion this time. Since it was strictly divided on the spot according to the amount of wheat submitted, no objections were raised, and I have reported the list to Lord Barov." He then stood up again to bow, "My report is finished."

"Well done." Roland clapped his hands twice to show encouragement. This young knight, formerly of the Wild Wolf family, now seemed to have adapted to town life and was doing quite well at the City Hall. With a little packaging, he could be an excellent propaganda example, which could play a significant role in the future when recruiting down-and-out nobles and knights from the stronghold.



The second to report was Scroll, her long hair pinned up at the back of her head, wearing a clean and tidy white shirt paired with a plain black long skirt without any decorations or lace, looking mature and capable. It was hard to imagine that just half a year ago, she was a fugitive witch who had to hide from the Church.

"At present, a total of two batches have completed primary education, totaling eighty-five people, most of whom had studied at Mr. Karl's academy." Her ability was eidetic memory, so she didn't need any preparation when reporting data, which Roland quite envied, "Forty-six of them chose to work at the City Hall, twenty-one decided to go to the bicycle factory, thirteen applied to join the First Army," she paused here, "and five people signed up for positions in the chemical laboratory."

Five people? Roland couldn't help but glance at Kyle Sichi, and the latter's expression was obviously not very good. It seemed that the effect of the award ceremony was far less than what he had expected; as a result, some of the three newly built laboratories might have to be idle for a while.

At least the employment rate was still one hundred percent, he consoled himself.
