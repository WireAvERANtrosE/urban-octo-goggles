## Victory and Defeat
"Prince actor is quite handsome, but his expression is too stiff," Margaret said.



"Ah, it's him," Roland said with slight surprise, "Morning Light, the first knight of the Western Region, is now serving as a teacher in Border Town, he's not really an actor."



"Not an actor?" the female merchant asked in astonishment, "Can he still perform on stage?"



"We're short on manpower," he said with a smile, "Look at the other two, they are the actors who were moving the scene props earlier. If they were to play the prince, that would really be... nothing like someone who could make Cinderella fall in love at first sight."



"...You do have a point."



Dressed in her finest, Irene stood to the side, watching as May walked over to Philip Hilt and placed her hand on his shoulder, starting to dance gracefully with him—no, Philip did not know how to dance; he was simply being led by May's exquisite dancing skills, following her lead. This segment had not appeared during rehearsals; Irene realized that this was May's improvisation.



"Big sister tried every means to seduce the prince, but he was unmoved, simply maintaining politeness and conversing with her, until Cinderella appeared before the prince, which shifted all his attention to the bright-eyed, beautiful woman with grace and charm."



Irene knew that as soon as she walked over, Philip would follow the script and toss May aside, enacting a love-at-first-sight romance with herself. But anyone could see that her dazed appearance now was not nearly as attractive as May's. Why would the prince abandon the more beautiful and charming her and choose the ordinary herself?



Just then, she caught the gaze that Philip cast her way.



There was resignation, comfort, encouragement, and... love.



Irene felt the stage suddenly fall silent; the laughter, shouts, and discussions of the townspeople had disappeared, as had the friends from the theater. Only May, Philip, and herself remained onstage.



Was it true that her acting skills were far from matching the Star of the Western Region? Should she just give up and admit defeat?



No, a voice whispered from the depths of Irene's heart. No, she wanted to keep acting. This was a rare opportunity for her, or perhaps... her last chance. If she gave up now, it was very likely that she would never encounter such an opportunity again, to compete on the same stage with such an outstanding actress.



She, too, wanted to become someone like May, who could captivate the audience with every gesture, drawing all the attention to herself.



I'm sorry, May.



She said inwardly.



If the prince were a male actor from the theater, she would hardly have the courage to compete. It was nearly impossible for her to think of overcoming the Star of the Western Region with her acting skills now.



But he wasn't. He was the Dawn's Light, her lover. Irene thought, please forgive me for being cunning, I don't want to lose to you in front of him.



The stage disappeared, and Irene was in front of a wheat field, the golden wheat ears ripe and heavily drooping, swaying gently with the evening breeze, waiting to be harvested. In the distance, one could see the setting sun dropping towards the horizon, casting a warm hue on the slowly flowing Redwater River. This was the place where they often had their secret meetings, amidst the red-orange twilight, the prince reverted back to a knight, to the one who had fallen in love with her a long time ago.

As long as she showed her most beautiful side in front of him, his gaze would no longer wander... It wasn't acting, but the true self, Irene lifted the cumbersome robe, tied a knot, and walked towards Philip.

Confidence returned to her heart, everything was so natural, she walked beside the knight, she smiled at May, who involuntarily let go of her hand resting on his shoulder.

"May I have this dance with you?" she asked.

A familiar smile appeared at the corner of Philip's eyes, "Of course, Miss."

Although not as skilled as May, under her lead, the knight danced more naturally than before, their tacit understanding infecting the audience around them, who began to applaud, whistle, followed by cheers.

The noise brought Irene back to the stage, she tiptoed for a gentle kiss on the prince's cheek, then pushed him away and ran quickly towards the backstage. At the same time, the deep bell tolls rolled over the square, with distant mountains sending back faint echoes, neither more nor less, exactly twelve times.

Soon, the drama was nearing its end, also the final climax of the play.

The prince searched house to house in the outer town, finally arriving at Cinderella's home, where the little girl had already changed into a dirty gray robe, holding a broom, pushed aside by her step-sister. And the step-sister was still beautiful and charming, and she too could fit into the glass slipper.



"Your Highness, why do you hesitate? I am the one you are looking for."

"No, she is not."

"You... you shut up!"

Although May was as imposing as before, if not more oppressive, Irene no longer shrank back. She walked out from the corner, step by step to the center of the stage, gazing directly at her opponent, showing a defiant and resistant expression.

The audience burst into applause at this wonderful scene.

Just then, the witch suddenly appeared. She raised her hand, and Cinderella was once again clad in her evening gown—

"Prince, she is the one you're searching for."

Rosia forcefully pulled off the gray cloak from Irene, revealing the evening dress beneath. Almost simultaneously, her coiled hair burst open, and after being smoothed out, the Cinderella who had captured the Prince's heart reappeared before everyone with an indescribable grace.

The atmosphere of the entire place was instantly ignited.



Everyone erupted into cheers under the embrace of the prince and Cinderella, and the timely sound of salutes from the cannons outside pushed the atmosphere to its peak. The endless applause and cheers merged into one, persisting even as the ending narration sounded and the actors bowed and exited the stage. The clapping did not cease.



"This is really too wonderful," Margaret remarked as she clapped, "I originally thought the girl would be completely overshadowed by May, but in the end, I didn't expect her to make a comeback. And I don't know if it's just my imagination, but her interaction with the prince seemed more natural than May's, as if... she truly belonged with the prince."



"Indeed, it was unexpected," Roland nodded. Irene became a different person afterwards, probably performing in her true colors, which is why she was able to maintain her confidence under May's aggressive pressure. To change the prince back into her own husband in such a short time and to break free of the stage's constraints is quite remarkable. Given time, she could surely become a rising star. Additionally, the echo effect of the bell and the sound of the cannons were also perfect. Without any rehearsal, Roland had only instructed her to improvise before the play began, and the result had pleasantly surprised him.



...



She lost, May closed her eyes.



She had gone to great lengths to have Philip Hilt play the role of the prince, hoping to leave a deep impression on him with her strongest performance on the stage she was most familiar with. To completely defeat Irene with her acting was how she intended to show him the gap between Irene and herself.



For this, she had even stayed in the small town for nearly a week, rehearsing the play with actors she would not normally even glance at. Wasting so much time, she feared that upon returning to Longsong Stronghold, the theater owner might not promote her as fervently as before. And what's more laughable was that she did not manage to utterly defeat Irene on the stage. She lost not to the other's acting, but to her love.



In that case, it was time to let go.



May took a deep breath, changed her clothes, and with a stern face, was the first to leave the dressing room.



Just as she walked down the wooden stairs off the stage, a man suddenly approached her.

He was tall and handsome, draped in glittering silver armor, likely a knight from Border Town—unlike the warm smile of Philip, his upturned eyebrows, narrow eyes, and thin lips gave off an air of pride and indifference.

"What is it?" May frowned.

"Hello, Miss May," to her surprise, as soon as he spoke, he completely dispelled his own intimidating demeanor, "I am His Highness's Chief Knight, Carter Lannis. Your performance was truly splendid. May I invite you for a drink?"
