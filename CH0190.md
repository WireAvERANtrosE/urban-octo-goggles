## Victory and Defeat
"The prince actor is quite handsome, but his expression is too stiff," Margaret said.

"Ah, it's actually him," Roland said with slight surprise, "Iron Axe, the First Knight of the Western Region, now serving as a teacher in Border Town, was never really an actor."

"Not an actor?" the female merchant asked in amazement, "And he can still perform on stage?"

"With limited manpower," he said with a smile, "look at the other two, they are the actors who were moving the props around earlier. If they were to play the prince, it would really be... they simply don't look like someone who could make Cinderella fall in love at first sight."

"...You do have a point."

Dressed up in her finest, Irene stood to one side, watching May walk over to Ferlin Eltek and place her hand on his shoulder, dancing gracefully with him—no, Ferlin could not dance, he was merely being led by May's exquisite dancing skills, swaying to her steps. This part had never appeared in the rehearsals, and Irene realized that this was May's improvisation.

"The sister tries her best to seduce the prince, but he remains unmoved, only maintaining a polite conversation with her until Cinderella appears before the prince, at which point all his attention shifts to this bright-eyed, white-toothed, and gracefully charming woman."

Irene knew that as soon as she walked over, Ferlin was supposed to follow the script and cast May aside, to enact a love-at-first-sight romance with her. But anyone could see that in her current dazed state, she wasn't nearly as attractive as May. Why would the prince abandon the more beautiful and enchanting her for the ordinary herself?

It was at that moment when she saw the look in Ferlin's eyes directed at her.



There was resignation, comfort, encouragement, and... love.

Irene felt the stage suddenly fall silent; the laughter, shouts, and discussions of the townspeople vanished, as did the friends from the theater. Only May, Ferlin, and herself remained on the stage.

Was it true that she was far behind the Star of the Western Region in acting? Should she just give up and admit defeat?

No, a voice in Irene's heart whispered softly. No, she wanted to keep acting. This was a rare opportunity for her, or perhaps... her last chance. If she gave up now, she might never encounter such an opportunity again to compete on stage with such an outstanding actress.

She, too, wanted to be like May, to captivate the audience with every gesture, to draw everyone's focus onto herself.

I'm sorry, May.

She said in her heart.

If the prince were a male actor from the theater, she would hardly have the courage to compete. It was nearly impossible for her now to overcome the Star of the Western Region through acting alone.

But he wasn't. He was the Dawnlight, her beloved. Irene thought, please forgive me for being unfair, I don't want to lose to you in front of him.



The stage disappeared, and before Erin's eyes lay a wheat field, its golden ears ripe and heavy, swaying gently with the evening breeze, awaiting harvest. In the distance, the setting sun kissed the horizon, casting a warm hue over the gently flowing Redwater River. This was the place where they often met secretly, bathed in the red-orange afterglow, where the prince reverted to a knight, to the one who had fallen in love long before.



All she had to do was present her most beautiful self before him, and his gaze would never stray... It wasn't an act, but her true self. Erin gathered her cumbersome robe and tied a knot, walking towards Phyllis.



Confidence returned to her heart, everything felt so natural. Approaching the knight, she smiled at May, who unconsciously let go of her hand from his shoulder.



"May I have this dance with you?" she asked.



A familiar smile appeared at the corner of Phyllis's eyes. "Of course, my lady."



Though she wasn't as skilled as May, under her lead, the knight danced more naturally than before. Their rapport infected the audience, who began to clap and whistle, followed by a rise in cheers.



The noise brought Erin back to the stage, where she tiptoed to give the prince a gentle kiss on the cheek before pushing him away and hurrying backstage. At the same time, the sonorous tolling of bells rolled across the square, with faint echoes coming from the distant mountains—twelve strikes, no more, no less.



Soon, the play was nearing its end, the final climax of the entire drama.



The prince searched from house to house in the outer city, finally arriving at Cinderella's home, where the little girl had already changed into a dirty gray cloak, broom in hand, pushed aside by her sister. Yet her sister remained beautiful and charming, also able to slip on that glass slipper.



"Your Highness, why are you still hesitating? I am the one you are looking for."

"No, she is not."

"You... you shut up!"

Although Mei's performance was no less intimidating than before, and even stronger in terms of oppressiveness, Irene no longer shrank back. She walked out of the corner, step by step to the center of the stage, locking eyes with her opponent, showing an unyielding and resistant expression.

The audience burst into applause for this splendid scene.

At that moment, the witch suddenly appeared, with a wave of her hand, she dressed Cinderella back in the evening gown—

"Prince, she is the one you are looking for."

Roland forcefully pulled off the gray cloak from Irene, revealing the evening dress underneath. Almost simultaneously, her hair tied up burst open, and after being smoothed out, the Cinderella who stole the prince's heart reappeared before everyone with an otherworldly grace.

The atmosphere of the entire place was instantly ignited.



Everyone erupted with excitement as the prince and Cinderella embraced, and the timely sound of celebratory cannon fire pushed the atmosphere to its peak. The continuous applause and cheers merged into one until the narrator's epilogue sounded, the actors bowed, and exited the stage, yet the clapping did not cease.



"That was really spectacular," Margaret said as she clapped, "I originally thought that the little girl would be completely overshadowed by May, but in the end, I didn't expect her to make a comeback. And I don't know if it's just me, but her interaction with the prince seemed more natural than May's, as if... she truly belongs with the prince."



"Indeed, it was surprising." Roland nodded. Behind him, Irene seemed to have transformed into a different person; she must have been acting naturally, which is why she managed to maintain her confidence under May's aggressive performance. To turn the prince back into her husband within such a short time and break free from the shackles of the stage, that ability is also quite remarkable. Given time, she might well become a rising star. Additionally, the echos of the bell and the sound of the cannons were also perfect. Having not rehearsed, Roland had only instructed her to improvise before the play began, and the result was unexpectedly pleasing.



...



She lost, May closed her eyes.



She had gone to great lengths to have the male lead playing the prince be taken by Ferlin Eltek, simply to make a lasting impression on him on her strongest stage. To utterly defeat Irene with her acting skills, to show him the gap between Irene and herself.



For this, she had stayed in the town for nearly a week, rehearsing the play with some actors she normally wouldn't even glance at. This delay had likely cost her; by now, returning to Longsong Stronghold, it was improbable that the theater owner would promote her as fervently as before. Moreover, the most laughable part was that she hadn't even managed to completely crush Irene on stage. She lost not to the other's acting skills, but to the other's love.



In that case, it was time to let go.



May took a deep breath, changed her clothes, and with a stern face, was the first to leave the dressing room.



Just as she walked down the wooden stairs from the stage, a man suddenly approached her.

He was tall and handsome, draped in shimmering silver armor, likely a knight from Border Town—different from the warm smiles of Dawnen's Light, Phyllis's smile always carried warmth, while he had raised eyebrows, narrow eyes, and thin lips that made him appear proud and indifferent.

"What is it?" May frowned.

"Hello, Miss May," unexpectedly, as soon as he began to speak, his icy demeanor was completely dispelled, "I am Prince Roland's Chief Knight, Carter Lannis. Your performance was truly spectacular, may I invite you for a drink?"
