## Clash
Roland had long pondered over the bullet design for the revolving firearms. The round lead bullets and loose gunpowder were simply too primitive. Considering Anna's processing capabilities, it was technically feasible to manufacture copper-cased fixed ammunition. The key issue was how to ignite the black powder filled inside the cartridge without reliable primers.



The primers for early metal-cased ammunition were generally made of highly impact-sensitive mercury fulminate. Pulling the trigger would drive the firing pin to strike, igniting the mercury fulminate at the bottom of the bullet, thereby igniting the propellant and shooting the bullet out of the gun barrel.



Unfortunately, despite racking his brains, Roland could not recall the exact ingredients required to produce mercury fulminate. From the literal meaning, it certainly involved nitric acid and mercury, but as the handwritten chemical equation showed, the reaction of these two substances would only produce mercury nitrate.



Moreover, knowing the ingredients does not guarantee successful production of the final product. During the reaction process, whether the solution requires specific concentrations and temperatures, or the addition of a catalyst, are key factors that affect the production of the product. Besides, due to its sensitive nature, mercury fulminate could easily detonate during manufacturing, risking the loss of fingers with a single careless mistake. Therefore, he dared not attempt to produce it himself.



Hence, Roland had to settle for the next best thing and continue to use the flintlock ignition method with metal cartridges. This required that the sparks be able to enter the inside of the cartridge to ignite the powder. Therefore, the bottom of the cartridge had to have a hole while also preventing the powder from leaking out.



Clearly, these two requirements were in irreconcilable conflict: the larger the hole, the faster the powder would leak. But if the hole was too small, the sparks from the flint would have a hard time igniting the powder inside.



He needed something that could be easily ignited by sparks while also plugging the hole to prevent the powder from leaking.



The first thing that came to Roland's mind was guncotton, also commonly known as nitrocellulose.



This was one of the few chemical products he remembered that could be used for weapons—because its raw materials were very simple: cotton soaked in a mixture of two strong acids. The acids were the most commonly used sulfuric acid and nitric acid, and the production process was not particularly dangerous. He had originally planned to wait until he recruited an alchemist before trying to produce guncotton. However, now that he had set the seven-day deadline, he decided to roll up his sleeves and get down to work himself.



Picking up the goose feather quill, he penned his long-pondered ideas onto the draft paper.

First was cotton, preferably the thin, uncolored cotton gauze that had been woven—there was a lot of this stuff moved back from the Duke's mansion, and it was now piling up in the castle's warehouse. The cotton gauze needed degreasing, otherwise, the grease attached to its surface would hinder the nitration process. The thing used to remove grease was well-known to most transmigrators, which was sodium hydroxide, commonly known as caustic soda. It was also the raw material for making detergents: by adding a solution of sodium hydroxide to fats and stirring evenly, then molding and solidifying, one could obtain soap for washing. It's just that Roland had been busy developing industry and agriculture and combating external enemies, so he hadn't had time to develop such daily necessities.

As for how to produce sodium hydroxide, the simplest method was probably by the electrolysis of saltwater. Thus, the prince discovered that to create a new type of bullet, he first had to start with a direct current generator.

...

Ashes walked beside the Redwater River, feeling somewhat disheartened.

Ever since those witches learned that her purpose here was to advise the members of the Witch Cooperation Association to leave Border Town, their attitude toward her had cooled down, no longer as warm as when they first met last night.

Moreover, she noticed that most of the witches were practicing their abilities in the castle's backyard, which indicated that Roland had also found a way to avoid the consequences of magical backlash. Her original plan to use this vital piece of information to gain the witches' favor had already fallen through. Apart from individually explaining the pros and cons to persuade them to leave, she was almost out of options.

What surprised Ashes the most was Roland Wimbledon—his appearance hadn't changed much, but there was an indescribable air about him, completely at odds with the image of the profligate son from before.

Why was this? He was clearly an incompetent person in the past, whose first thought in the face of trouble was to escape. Not to mention standing up for others, he was even afraid to take responsibility for his own actions. She remembered that one time when a disdainful look from her made him panic and fall to the ground. When Tilly came upon hearing the noise, he lied that he had fallen by accident, and even blamed the fifth princess, asking why she would choose such an ugly woman as a guard.



From that moment on, Ashes' opinion of the Fourth Prince had hit rock bottom.

She had thought that someone like him would be easy to deal with, but during today's negotiations, she was completely unable to gain the upper hand, especially after he proposed a one-on-one duel. She found that even the threat of force was ineffective—because he didn't evade responsibility, but instead planned to address her doubts directly through the duel. Any further threats to his person would only serve to reduce the witches' goodwill towards her and nothing more.

Ashes sighed. If only she were as clever as Tilly, any problem would be easily solved in her presence. If faced with this situation, she would surely come up with a solution, right? The ease and anticipation she had felt on her journey had vanished without a trace. If it weren't for her desire to help Tilly as much as possible, Ashes truly wished to immediately board a ship bound for Clearwater Harbor and leave Graycastle as soon as possible.

Unknowingly, she found herself walking beyond the boundaries of the town. Across the river, instead of the lush wheat fields, there were forests yet to be cultivated.

Just as Ashes was about to turn back, a surge of magical power suddenly came from behind her. Instinctively, she turned her head, and a dagger thrust past her cheek, followed by a swift horizontal slash. The surging magic turned into a towering wave, and Ashes felt a sharp pain on half of her face; the attacker's fluid movements were clearly not those of an ordinary person. Without hesitation, she let her body fully collapse to the side, avoiding the dagger that swept past her face and using the momentum to propel herself away with one foot.

However, the assailant vanished into thin air and reappeared behind her in the blink of an eye. Ashes didn't even see how the person moved.

She drew her greatsword, spinning her body in a circle and driving the blade through the air with a dull whoosh. Its swift speed kicked up a cloud of dust from the ground. This attack pattern, with no blind spots, should have eliminated any threats within the range of the sword. But it was ineffective against the opponent's elusive movements; the greatsword swept through the shadow's position as if it had touched nothing at all.

This is bad, she thought to herself, her muscles tensing as she braced for the next round of attacks. But then the shadow vanished from in front of her. As the dust slowly settled, the figure stood not far from her, toying with a dagger in hand.

It was Nightingale.



"Is this a warning?" Ashes frowned.



"Of course not," she tucked the dagger into her waistband, "I just wanted to see the strength of an Extraordinary."



"Is that so? I thought you were going to say—"



"—that you should leave Border Town quickly, or else I'll be unkind to you?" Nightingale interrupted, "If that's the case, what difference would there be between me and Cara?"



Cara? Why would she mention the former leader of the Witch Cooperation Association? Ashes wondered, puzzled.



"You can rest assured and persuade every sister. If someone wishes to leave with you, I think His Highness won't stop you, and of course, I won't either. However..." Nightingale paused, "Don't try to harm or threaten Prince Roland, or else next time I won't intentionally miss." With these words, she grinned and vanished into the air, "Enjoy your life in Border Town."



Indeed, she came to warn me after all, Ashes shook her head.
