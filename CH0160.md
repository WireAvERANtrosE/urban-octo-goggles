## Clash
Roland had long pondered over the design of bullets for the revolving firearms. The round lead bullets and loose gunpowder were far too outdated. Considering Anna's processing capabilities, the direct manufacture of copper-cased fixed ammunition was technically feasible. The key issue was how to ignite the black powder loaded inside the cartridge without a reliable primer.

Early metal-cased fixed ammunition typically used mercury fulminate as an extremely sensitive primer; pulling the trigger would move the firing pin, igniting the mercury fulminate at the base of the bullet, thereby lighting the propellant and shooting the projectile out of the gun barrel.

Unfortunately, despite racking his brains, he could not remember the exact raw materials needed to produce mercury fulminate. From the literal meaning, it certainly involved nitric acid and mercury, but as the handwritten reaction formula showed, the reaction between these two substances would only yield mercury nitrate.

Moreover, knowing the raw materials did not guarantee successful production of the final product. Whether the concentration and temperature of the solution during the reaction process were required, or whether a catalyst needed to be added, were key factors affecting the yield of the product. Additionally, due to its sensitive nature, mercury fulminate could easily trigger an explosion during production, and a moment of carelessness could cost him a couple of fingers, so he dared not attempt it himself.

Thus, Roland had to settle for the next best thing. While using metal cartridges, he still opted for the flintlock ignition method, which required the sparks to enter the cartridge and ignite the gunpowder. This meant that the base of the cartridge had to have a hole, while also preventing the leakage of gunpowder.

Clearly, these two requirements were in irreconcilable conflict: the larger the hole, the faster the gunpowder would leak. But if the hole was too small, the sparks from the flint would have difficulty igniting the gunpowder inside.

He needed something that could be easily ignited by the sparks while also plugging the hole to prevent the gunpowder from leaking.

The first thing that came to Roland's mind was guncotton, commonly known as nitrocellulose.

This was one of the few chemical products for weaponry he remembered because its preparation materials were very simple: cotton soaked in a mixed acid solution of two strong acids. The acids were the most commonly used sulfuric acid and nitric acid, which posed no danger during production. He had initially planned to wait until he recruited an alchemist before trying to produce guncotton, but now that he had set a seven-day deadline, he decided to roll up his sleeves and get down to work himself.

Picking up the goose feather quill, he penned down the long-brewing plan onto draft paper.

First was cotton, preferably the thin, uncolored cotton gauze that had been spun—the Duke's Mansion had moved a lot of this back, and it was now piling up in the castle's warehouse. The cotton gauze needed to be degreased, otherwise, the grease adhering to the surface would hinder nitrification. Most transmigrators were familiar with the substance used to remove grease, which is sodium hydroxide, commonly known as caustic soda. It was also raw material for making detergents: adding a solution of sodium hydroxide to fats and stirring evenly before molding would yield soap for cleaning. However, Roland had been busy developing industry and agriculture and combating external threats, so he had no time to develop such daily necessities for the time being.

As for how to produce sodium hydroxide, the simplest method was probably the electrolysis of salt water. Thus, the prince realized that to create a new type of bullet, he first needed to start with a direct current generator.
...
Ashes walked along the Redwater River, feeling vaguely downhearted.

Ever since those witches learned that her purpose for coming here was to persuade the Witch Cooperation Association sisters to leave Border Town, their attitude towards her had cooled, no longer as enthusiastic as when they first met last night.

Moreover, she noted that most witches would practice their abilities in the castle's backyard, indicating that Roland had also found a way to avoid being devoured by magic power. Her plan to exchange this vital piece of information for the witches' goodwill had already been dashed. Apart from individually explaining the pros and cons to persuade them to leave, she had almost no other strategies.

What surprised Ashes most was Roland Wimbledon—his appearance hadn't changed much, but there was an indescribable aura about him that was completely different from his former image as a profligate son.

Why had this happened? He was clearly incompetent before, always thinking of escaping when confronted with problems. He couldn't even stand up for others, let alone take responsibility for his own actions. Recalling that harassment incident, just a look of disgust had sent him panicking and tumbling to the ground. When Tilly arrived at the scene, he lied that he had fallen by accident and even blamed the fifth princess, questioning why she would choose such an ugly woman for her guard.

From that moment on, Ashes' opinion of the fourth prince had plummeted to an all-time low.
She had thought that such a person would be easy to deal with, but during today's negotiation, she was completely unable to gain the upper hand, especially after the other party proposed a one-on-one duel. She found that even the threat of force was ineffective—because he did not evade the questioning but intended to respond to her doubts through the duel. Threatening him personally at this point would do nothing but reduce the witches' favorability towards her.

Ashes sighed. If only she were as clever as Tilly, every difficult problem would be easily solved. Faced with such a situation, she too would surely find a solution, right? The ease and anticipation she had felt on her way here had vanished without a trace. If it weren't for her desire to help Tilly as much as possible, Ashes would have wished to immediately board a ship bound for Clearwater Harbor and leave Greycastle at the earliest opportunity.

Unknowingly, she found herself already outside the bounds of the small town. Across the river, instead of the lush wheat fields, there was a forest yet to be reclaimed.

Just as Ashes was about to turn back, a surge of magic power suddenly came from behind her. She instinctively turned her head, and a dagger stabbed past her cheek, then swept across in a fluid motion. The surging magic had become a towering wave, and Ashes felt a sharp pain as if half of her face had been slashed. The opponent's seamless moves were clearly not something an ordinary person could achieve. Without hesitation, she let her body collapse completely, dodging the dagger that swept past her face, and with a push off from one foot, she propelled herself away.

However, the opponent vanished into thin air and reappeared behind her in the blink of an eye. Ashes couldn't even see how the other party moved.

She drew her greatsword, spun her body in a circle, driving the blade to emit a dull whooshing sound. The speed was so fast that it kicked up a cloud of dust from the ground. This attack method, with no blind spots, could neutralize any threats within the range of the sword, but it was ineffective against the opponent's eerie movements. The greatsword swept through the position of the shadow, as if it had hit nothing at all.

This is bad, she thought, her muscles tensing up, ready to withstand the next round of attacks when the shadow disappeared from in front of her. The dust slowly settled to the ground, and there stood the person, not far from her, toying with a dagger in hand.

It was Nightingale.

"Is this a warning?" Ashes frowned.

"Of course not," she sheathed the dagger at her waist, "I just wanted to see the strength of a Transcendent."

"Is that so? I thought you were going to say—"

"—that you better leave Border Town quickly, or I won't be polite anymore?" Nightingale interrupted, "If that's the case, what difference would there be between me and Cara?"

Cara? Why would she mention the former leader of the Witch Cooperation Association? Ashes wondered, puzzled.

"You can reassure every sister that if anyone wishes to leave with you, I believe His Highness won't stop you, and of course, neither will I. However..." Nightingale paused, "don't try to harm or threaten Prince Roland, or next time I won't intentionally miss." With that, she flashed a grin and vanished into thin air, "Enjoy your life in Border Town."

As expected, it was still a warning after all, Ashes shook her head.
