## Perplexed
"How is she?" Roland put down the pen in his hand and looked up at Nightingale who had quietly appeared in the office.



"She's asleep now, just had a bowl of wheat porridge. Her appetite is not bad," she walked over to the table and sat back in her usual spot, "Now it's Sylvie who's watching her."



"Good."



"Do you believe what she said?" Nightingale asked.



"Anyway, the Divine Stone of Judgement has been removed. Tomorrow, when we question her again, you'll be able to tell if she's lying, but..." Roland paused for a moment, "I think most of what she said is true."



"Why?" she asked curiously.



"Have you noticed that a person from four hundred years ago is using the same language and script as us?" the prince said, propping his chin on his hand, "In theory, it's almost impossible for this to happen between two regions separated by the insurmountable Impassable Mountain Range—unless both areas originally belonged to the same source and had very close contact."



"But she referred to the four kingdoms as barbaric lands."



"That's the key... I'm not clear on what the scene here was over four hundred years ago, perhaps just a few scattered villages and some criminals exiled here from the witch world. The kingdom's historical records also mention that the ages of the major cities are generally between two hundred to three hundred years, and it was in that era that the astrologers emerged," he said with interest. "I've always been curious why the astrologers, who generally have no achievements and no research results, are called 'wise men' alongside the alchemists. Now I think I understand—the Federation led the surviving people to flee to this borderland, bringing with them their language and civilization. These people integrated with the locals, helping them to establish governments, fortresses, and cities."



"It sounds like you saw it with your own eyes," Nightingale said with a smile and a shake of her head.



"It's the only way to explain why we use the same language as her," Roland said seriously, "because we share the same origin. And in these four hundred years, civilization has been rebuilding without any development."



"Alright," she said, spreading her hands, "we'll know the answer tomorrow anyway. If you're wrong... you owe me an extra 'luxurious lunch.'"



The so-called luxurious lunch was actually a combination of corn chowder, roasted chicken legs, and ice cream bread, which the kitchen only made once a week.



"What if you're wrong?"



"You can have whatever you want," Nightingale said, tilting her head and half-closing her eyes. Her cheeks and smooth neck formed a perfect curve, making her look extraordinarily charming. If someone's appearance scores full marks, then any pose they strike is seductive, and Roland had finally verified the truth of this statement.



"I'll remember that," he coughed twice, refocusing his attention back to the paper.



Because Agatha had just awakened, Roland couldn't force her to answer all questions accurately and in detail. He basically followed her train of thought, asking wherever her mind went, so the information he received was quite chaotic. His current task was to reorganize the information in Agatha's words and figure out the key points that needed clarification next.



Without a doubt, the most pressing issue was the Devils.

The reasons behind the war with the Devils, and why they have now ceased their aggression, were crucial pieces of intelligence for Border Town. No war ever started without a cause, and the actions of the Devils did not seem like an invasion for resources and expansion: they did not occupy the wastelands, nor did they capture humans – it appeared to be purely an act of slaughter.

Roland also noticed the term "Battle of Divine Will" mentioned by the other party. Could it be that both sides were engaged in a life-and-death struggle under the guidance of the gods? But at that time, the Church was nowhere to be seen, and naturally, the sole deity they proclaimed did not exist. Without an explanation for this, he could never settle down.

At the same time, he needed to quickly understand the lifestyle— or rather, the economic foundation—of the Holy City civilization. These details would help him gauge the level of development of that civilization and indirectly determine the strength of the Devils.

As for the Union, Roland was not too concerned. The scarcity of witches and the instability of their abilities had already doomed the organization's combat effectiveness to not be very high. Historical experience has repeatedly emphasized that, without a technological generation gap, total war depended on attrition, and scarce high-end weapons could not reverse an overall disadvantage.

The second point was the Magic Stones.

Combining Tilly's statement, these stones' magical properties could greatly compensate for the instability of abilities, allowing witches to exert powers not their own and enabling support witches to enter the battlefield—although in Roland's eyes, this was completely the wrong approach. He would rather have all the combat witches transformed into support ones, invested in endless production work.

However, strangely, the Union, which had many witches, did not adopt this method to fight the Devils but instead chose to create the God's Punishment Army, which was somewhat incomprehensible. Could it be that Magic Stones had some unknown drawbacks, or were they extremely difficult to produce?

Fortunately, Agatha was a member of the Quest Society, an organization similar to the current Alchemy Workshop, gathering a group of highly talented witches who specialized in the research of Magic Stones and magic power. Roland faintly felt that there should be great potential to be tapped into here.



The last doubt was about the Church.

He circled this item, realizing that the establishment and development of the organization obviously couldn't be answered by Agatha. What could be inferred from the bits and pieces was: the Church was established after the defeat of the witches, they had obtained the secrets of the Union, and covered up everything about the witches, painting them as the embodiments of devils. If the people of the four kingdoms were seen as the descendants of the natives, then the Church was truly an outsider, and since the natives themselves had no civilization to speak of, it was not surprising that they were deceived by the fabricated history and oracles.

Was everything simply because the witch class had once oppressed the common people, and the refugees who fled saw the witches as enemies, leading to the widespread hunting of witches on this continent? Roland frowned, it seemed to make sense, but... something felt off.

The Union had many Blessed Warriors and Extraordinaries, even those above Extraordinary... Even if they held the Divine Stone of Judgement, they couldn't possibly defeat such an opponent, right?

To completely erase a force much more powerful than oneself couldn't be done with just hatred, there was clearly a key piece of information missing in the intelligence.

"That witch doesn't seem to like you very much," Nightingale suddenly said.

"After all, living in a world where witches are superior," Roland chuckled, "in her eyes, I'm probably no different from the weeds by the roadside."

"You don't hate her?"

"Why should I? She is just a poor person abandoned by the times," he shook his head, "having slept in the ice coffin for over four hundred years, waking up to find the world completely changed, the strangeness and fear that comes with it must have made her build walls around her heart. Once she accepts all this, she should gradually change her views."



"That's indeed the way you answer," Nightingale smiled. "Don't worry, I won't let her offend you in the slightest."
