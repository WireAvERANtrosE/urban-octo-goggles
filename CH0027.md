## Memories
The weather grew colder with each passing day, and Roland found himself waking up later and later. 

As a member of the ruling class, he certainly had the privilege of sleeping in. Especially with the bed that had three layers of velvet blankets, where one would sink into a soft embrace as they lay down, further indulging his desire to stay in bed.



By the time Roland finished washing up and walked into his office, Nightingale had already been waiting for him there.

"Here, your breakfast. I ate half of it while it was still warm, and now it's all cold." She pursed her lips towards the half-eaten plate of bread on the table, looking very much like she was the master of the place.

"Has no one ever taught you to maintain humility in front of a prince?" Roland pushed aside the plate and sat back at his desk. "I remember you used to be quite well-mannered at the beginning."

He sighed inwardly, not having realized that this person was so forward. If she wasn't by Anna's side, she would come to loiter around his place. She used to hide her figure, but now, as long as there were no outsiders, she would walk around the office openly, not even bothering to wear her hood.



"Like this?" She hopped off the table and performed a flawless noble's curtsy. "You've been getting up later and later, so I saw the breakfast sitting there and decided to help myself to a bit. Your Highness," she leaned in close to Roland, "you don't mind, do you? Besides, you don't like those complicated formalities. I can tell."

Do you have clairvoyance or what, Roland thought ruefully, you can tell that too?



He sighed, "Do as you like, but in the future, if you eat breakfast, then finish it. If I want to eat, I will order another serving."



"As you command, Your Highness!" She smiled lightly, grabbed the dinner plate, and ran off to the side.

Roland spread out a blank piece of parchment, ready to complete the design that he had left halfway finished yesterday.

To hold Border Town, the battle after the arrival of winter could not be a Pyrrhic victory. Although an army that has never seen blood is not a qualified army, Roland worried that if there were significant losses, whether this group of people, who had been trained in a short period of time, would still have the courage to stand on the town walls.

He needed weapons from a different era to gain an absolute advantage over the demonic beasts.

Without a doubt, that was the firearm.

In fact, this era already had all the conditions necessary for the emergence of firearms. Alchemists often prepared a substance called "snow powder" for use in court celebrations as salutes. This stuff was just gunpowder with the wrong formula, burning slowly. If put into a copper tube, it mostly just made a sound.

Probably in another hundred years, the prototype of the firearm—the matchlock gun—would appear. Because this weapon was cumbersome to operate, requiring two people to work together to load and shoot, it was generally used as a single-shot weapon. Its rate of fire and power were even less than a well-trained archer.

Of course, Roland had no interest in reenacting history. Just like with the steam engine, he could fully utilize the witches' abilities to create firearms with practical combat value.

"You weren't here when I checked the orders on the table," Nightingale asked nonchalantly after swallowing the last piece of bread, "What do you plan to do with so many ice wands? It's winter now. If you want to drink chilled barley beer, couldn't you just leave it outside overnight?"



The upper-class nobles were fond of using ice wands—also known as saltpeter—to make ice in the summer, which they then used to chill milk, wine, or fruit juice for consumption. Thanks to the season, the price of saltpeter was now very low.



"Making chilled cheese requires freezing temperatures, which aren't low enough right now. It needs to freeze," Roland bluffed.



The woman before him, though not an enemy, was also not as thoroughly understood as Anna. Unlike the steam engine, firearms were not protected by many technical barriers. Once spread, it was clear that they would not benefit his development plans. Before he could understand her true intentions, it was better to keep some things hidden. With this in mind, he tentatively asked, "Aside from seeking the Holy Mountain, does the Witch Cooperation Association also train assassins?"



"No, they're just a group of pitiful people united by their dreams," Nightingale waved dismissively, "I've only joined the Cooperation in the past two years."



"So, you were serving others before?" Roland was quite certain that her impressive throwing skills couldn't be self-taught without years of practice and guidance, "Aside from me, are there other people willing to shelter witches?"



"Shelter?" Nightingale's expression became a bit odd, "How could that be possible... If he knew I would become a witch, he wouldn't even let me through the front door. As for what happened later, if I hadn't still been of use to him, I would probably have been secretly executed a long time ago."



"Oh? Can you tell me about it?"



Nightingale smiled and shook her head, but this time her smile had an ambiguous emotion, "Your Highness, when the time is right, I will tell you. I know what you're worried about, please rest assured, I have been free for five years now and no longer need to serve anyone."



The negotiation check failed; it seemed that his charisma attribute wasn't high enough... However, her response also indirectly confirmed his thoughts—at least five years ago, she had done some shady work for someone. Fortunately, his use of Nightingale seemed to be just a one-time coincidence, unlike his plans to recruit witches on a large scale.



Roland did not press further and continued to focus on his own drawings.



To his slight surprise, Nightingale, who usually liked to stick around, quieted down at this moment, leaving only the sound of the burning stove in the room. By the time Roland looked up to stretch his stiff neck, there was no sign of her in the office.



"Not even a goodbye," he muttered, folding the parchment in his hand and placing it in the inner pocket of his clothes.



After several busy days, and with the addition of this drawing, the design of the weapons—or rather, the replication—was complete.



What he planned to produce was the renowned flintlock rifle. This weapon had been tested by history, with a difficulty of manufacture similar to that of the matchlock gun, using a rear-loading primer and a front-loading bullet. Its firing rate could reach up to three rounds per minute, more than enough to deal with the mindless mutated beasts.



Most animals cannot climb walls, so the shooting distance is roughly equal to the height from the top of the town wall to the ground, which is about twelve feet. Within this distance, even aiming with one's foot wouldn't miss the target, and since the bullet's initial speed hardly decreased, as long as the demonic beasts have not evolved an exterior harder than steel, they can essentially be killed with a single shot.



The drawback of the flintlock rifle lies in the production time. Like the matchlock gun, it initially relied on craftsmen to hammer it out piece by piece, from the barrel to the trigger, with the whole gun taking about three months to make. The barrel is the main component, requiring the iron sheet to be hammered into a cylindrical shape and the bore drilled with rifling. Although it doesn't require any precise instruments, only skilled craftsmen could produce a qualified barrel.



This was also why Roland wanted to create a steam engine first.



With a steam engine, he could use a steel drill bit to directly bore the barrel out of a solid iron rod, significantly increasing the production speed and eliminating the need for skilled craftsmen. Only a workbench capable of securing the iron rod would be necessary.
