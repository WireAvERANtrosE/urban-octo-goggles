## Past
The weather was growing colder each day, and Roland was waking up later and later. As a member of the ruling class, he certainly had the right to sleep in. Especially with his large bed padded with three layers of velvet blankets, sinking into its soft embrace only encouraged his desire to stay in bed.

When Roland finally finished his morning routine and walked into his office, Nightingale was already there waiting for him.

"Here, your breakfast. I ate half of it while it was still hot. Now it's all cold," she said, pointing to the plate of half-eaten bread on the table. She acted as though she were the master of the place.

"Haven't you been taught to show humility in the presence of a prince?" Roland asked as he moved the plate away and sat down at his desk. "I remember you used to be more respectful."

He sighed inwardly. He had never expected her to be such a familiar figure, always hanging around him when she wasn't with Anna. She used to conceal her presence, but now, as long as there were no outsiders, she openly roamed his office, not even bothering to wear her hood.

"Like this?" she asked, jumping down from the table and performing an impeccable curtsy. "You've been waking up later and later, and I saw that your breakfast was just sitting there, so I helped myself. Your Highness," she said, sidling up to Roland, "you don't mind, do you? Besides, you don't like all those tedious formalities. I can tell."

Do you have some sort of psychic ability? Roland thought to himself. How could she possibly know that?

He sighed again. "Do as you like, but if you're going to eat my breakfast in the future, finish it. If I want to eat, I'll order another serving."

"As you command, Your Highness," she smiled gently, picked up the plate and went off to the side.

Roland unfolded a piece of blank parchment, ready to complete the design that he had left half-finished the day before.

To hold Border Town, the coming winter's battle could not be a costly victory. Although an army that had never seen blood was not a qualified army, Roland was worried that should there be significant losses, would this group of short-term trained individuals still have the courage to stand on the city walls.

He needed weapons from a new era to gain absolute advantage over the demonic beasts.

Without a doubt, that would be firearms.

In fact, this era already had all the conditions for the emergence of firearms. Alchemists often prepared something called "snow powder", used for salutes in court celebrations. This stuff was incorrectly formulated gunpowder; its burning speed was slow, and when placed into a copper tube, it could only make a sound.

In about a hundred years, the prototype of the firearm - the matchlock gun would appear. This firearm was cumbersome to operate, requiring two people to complete the loading and shooting action, and could only be used as a single-shot weapon under normal circumstances. Its rate of fire and power were still inferior to a well-trained archer.

Of course, Roland had no interest in reenacting history. Like the steam engine, he could fully utilize the witches' abilities to create firearms with practical value.

"I took a look at the orders on your desk while you were away," Nightingale swallowed the last piece of bread and asked casually, "What do you plan to do with so many ice spikes? It's winter now, if you want to drink chilled barley wine, wouldn't it be enough to leave it outside overnight?"

Upper-class nobles enjoy using ice spikes, also known as saltpeter, to make ice and cool their milk, wine, or fruit juice during the summer. Thanks to the season, the current price of saltpeter is very low.
"Making ice-cold cheese requires a temperature low enough for it to freeze," Roland coaxed. 
The woman before him was not an enemy, but she was also not as familiar as Anna. Unlike the steam engine, there were no significant technical barriers for firearms. If such knowledge were to spread, it would clearly be detrimental to his farming plans. Before he could figure out her background, it would be better to withhold some information. With this in mind, he asked tentatively, "Does the Witch Cooperation Association train assassins in addition to searching for the Holy Mountain?"
"No, they are just a group of poor people gathered together for their dreams," Nightingale waved her hand, "I joined the Association only in the recent two years."
"So you were serving others before?" The beautiful throwing skill she had could not be achieved without guidance and years of practice, Roland was sure of this, "Besides me, are there others willing to shelter witches?"
"Shelter?" Nightingale's expression became a bit strange, "How could that be possible... If he knew I would become a witch, he wouldn't even let me through the door. As for what happened later, if I wasn't still useful to him, I would have been secretly executed long ago."
"Oh? Can you tell me more about it?" 
Nightingale smiled and shook her head, but this time her smile carried an ambiguous emotion, "Your Highness, when the time is right, I will tell you. I know what you are worried about. Rest assured, I have been free for five years and no longer need to serve anyone."
The negotiation check failed, it seems his charm attribute isn't high enough... But her answer indirectly confirmed his thoughts â€” at least five years ago, she had done some unsightly deeds for someone. Fortunately, his use of Nightingale seemed to be due to a coincidence, rather than a plan to recruit witches on a large scale, like himself.

Roland didn't ask any further, continuing to focus on his blueprint. To his mild surprise, Nightingale, who was usually always hovering around him, had quieted down. The only sound in the room was the crackling of the fireplace. By the time Roland raised his head, trying to ease his stiff neck, Nightingale was nowhere to be seen in the office. 

"She left without saying a word," he muttered, carefully folding the parchment in his hand and placing it in his pocket. 

After several days of hard work, the design of the weapons - or, to be precise, their replication - was finally complete. What he planned to produce was the famous flintlock rifle. This weapon, tested by history, was as difficult to manufacture as the matchlock gun. It utilized a rear-loading mechanism for the gunpowder and a front-loading mechanism for the lead bullets. The firing rate could reach nearly three rounds per minute, more than sufficient to deal with the unintelligent mutated beasts. 

Most animals couldn't climb walls, so the shooting distance was roughly equivalent to the height from the top of the city wall to the ground, about twelve feet. Even if one aimed with their feet at this distance, they wouldn't miss the target, and the speed of the bullet hardly decreased on firing. As long as the demonic beasts hadn't evolved a hide harder than steel, they could practically be killed with a single shot. 

The drawback of the flintlock gun was its manufacturing time. Initially, just like the matchlock gun, it was painstakingly crafted by artisans, hammer blow by hammer blow. From the barrel to the trigger, it took about three months to make a complete gun. The barrel was the most time-consuming part, requiring the blacksmith to hammer a flat piece of iron into a cylindrical shape, fill the muzzle with iron dust, and then bore and rifle the barrel. Although no precision instruments were required, only experienced craftsmen could produce a satisfactory barrel. 

This was also the reason why Roland had prioritized the construction of a steam engine. 

With a steam engine, he could use a steel drill to bore the gun barrel directly out of a solid iron rod. This method would significantly speed up production and wouldn't require a skilled craftsman to operate, only a workbench that could secure the iron rod.
