## Training (Part 2)
Flames rose from beneath her feet and quickly faded away.

This was the twenty-third practice.

Another failure.

Anna's forehead was already beaded with sweat; she wiped it with the back of her hand, and immediately steam rose up, hissing.

She didn't pause for a moment, immediately starting the next practice. The witch's uniform was neatly folded and set aside—if she hadn't insisted on doing so from the beginning, the clothes would have likely turned to ash in the flames long ago.

Fortunately, as the Fourth Prince, it wasn't difficult for Roland to get a few spare outfits. He had Tyra bring over a whole barrel of robes— all temporarily collected from the maids.

The twenty-fourth practice finally saw some success; the flame no longer rose from her feet, but appeared out of thin air in her palm. She carefully raised her arm, wanting to move it to her fingertips, but the flame wavered and with a whoosh, shot up her arm, igniting the sleeve and then consuming the robe along the sleeve.

Anna extinguished the flame and emotionlessly tore off the half-charred robe, turning to the barrel to search for a new one.

Whenever this happened, Roland would avert his gaze, focusing his eyes elsewhere—even though the other party didn't care about it at all.



In fact, if Roland hadn't insisted strongly, she would probably have practiced naked. But in that case, Roland wouldn't have been able to watch properly, as he really couldn't keep calm in front of a young girl who was completely bare—especially when the figure of the girl transformed into flames had a uniquely enchanting charm.

Roland shook his head, casting aside the stray thoughts. As it stood, mastering this power was truly not an easy task. The phased goal he had set for Anna was to release flames from the palm of her hand or her fingertips without damaging the clothes on her body, and to maintain a high enough temperature to melt the iron ingots in the pool.



After the thirtieth failed practice, Roland called a halt.

"Take a break."

Anna stared at him blankly, unresponsive.

Roland had no choice but to walk over, take the girl's hand, and lead her to a chair, forcibly making her sit down.

"You're tired, and when you're fatigued, you should rest, there's no need to push yourself too hard. We have plenty of time," he said as he wiped the sweat from her forehead, "Let's have some afternoon tea first."

...

Roland knew that the nobility of the Kingdom of Greycastle didn't have the habit of enjoying afternoon tea. The productivity of this world was so poor that people rarely had the leisure to taste refined foods—not even three meals a day were universal, let alone four. As for the idle young masters and mistresses, they would typically be found gathered in taverns or gambling houses at this time.



If there isn't such a habit, then create one. There are ready-made pastries, and if there is no tea, beer can be used as a substitute—knowing that he was going to a remote border town, the Fourth Prince brought all his maids, servants, and chefs with him.

Thus, in the simple wooden shed in the castle's backyard, the first afternoon tea was held.

Anna looked at the plates of exquisite pastries with a bit of disbelief in her eyes. Why could food also be made to look so appealing?

Although she could not name the pastries specifically, the pure white appearance paired with the bright red fruits was enough to whet one's appetite, especially with the delicate patterns adorned around the edges of the pastries, which once again made a deep impression on her worldview.

Roland watched Anna's bewildered expression with pride. It was just a strawberry cream cake, and it seemed to have scared this country bumpkin. Moreover, the strawberries were preserved with sugar and were no longer fresh.

More interesting than eating was watching the witch's expressions. Roland watched as she carefully placed the cake into her mouth, her blue eyes almost shining, and her hair swaying back and forth, suddenly giving him the illusion of watching a gourmet anime.

—Any dish that doesn't shine is not good cuisine!

Well, this feeling of character development is also quite nice.

So, watching Anna practice and enjoying afternoon tea with her became a part of Roland's daily life. Even if he did not attend to government affairs himself, Barov would manage everything in an orderly manner.



Three days later, Barov brought all the organized information about Border Town to Prince Roland's office. Such an event would have been unthinkable before; the fourth prince actually had the patience to look through such a tedious pile of reports.



In fact, he did not. Roland only read two lines before he felt dizzy and said directly to Barov, "Read it to me."



After listening to the Minister Assistant's report for an hour, he noticed something amiss, "Why are Border Town's tax revenue and trade both zero during the winter season?"



It was understandable that the yield of various crops would decrease due to the low temperatures in winter, but what did it mean for it to drop to zero? Did the local people have a habit of hibernating?



Barov coughed twice and said, "Your Highness, have you forgotten? Winter is the Evil Months, and Border Town has no defensive capabilities. All residents must migrate to Longsong Stronghold. However, rest assured, your safety is definitely our top priority."



'Evil Months'? Roland recalled, it seemed there was such a term—before this, he had not taken ghost stories and evil witches seriously, considering them nothing more than absurd tales from an uncivilized world. But now it seemed, evil or not, witches indeed existed. What about the other widely circulated ghost stories, then?



During the court lessons, the history tutor had explained the Evil Months in detail. Every winter, after the first snowfall, the sun would dim and the Gates of Hell in the Dragonspine Mountains would open at this time.



The evil breath from hell would corrupt living beings, turning them into servants of the devil. Some animals would mutate into powerful evil beasts and attack humans. Witches were also mostly born during this season, and their powers were far greater than usual.



"Have you seen it? The Gates of Hell," Roland asked.



"Your Highness, how could an ordinary person possibly see that!" Barov shook his head repeatedly, "Not to mention that the Dragonspine Mountains are simply insurmountable, even approaching the mountains would affect one with an evil miasma, causing minor headaches to unbearable extents, and in severe cases, the loss of one's mind. Unless..."

"Unless what?"

"Unless that person is a witch. Only witches can see the Gates of Hell because they have fallen and become minions of the devil, naturally unaffected by the evil aura." As he said this, Barov even glanced back at the rear garden.

"What about the demonic beasts, then? You must have seen those, right?" Roland tapped the table unhappily.

"Uh, I have not seen them. Like Your Highness, this is my first time in these remote lands. In the heart of the Kingdom of Greycastle, it's very rare for anyone to encounter true evil."

How could this place develop if it migrates every year? He originally thought that Border Town was just barren, but still had potential for development, but now it seemed like a huge pitfall.

"Longsong Stronghold can withstand the demonic beasts, which means they can also be killed and are not invincible! So why can't we defeat them in Border Town?"

"Longsong Stronghold has huge walls and is garrisoned with the Duke of Lion's elite troops; it's not comparable to a small place like Border Town," Barov explained, "From the beginning, the purpose of establishing Border Town was to provide an early warning for the stronghold, which is why it was set up between the Northern Slope Mine and the Redwater River."

Just like cannon fodder placed in the enemy's inevitable path, Roland sneered.
