## Training (Part 2)
Flames rose from beneath her feet and then quickly subsided.

This was the twenty-third practice.

Another failure.

Anna's forehead was already beaded with sweat, which she wiped with the back of her hand, instantly causing steam to rise and make a sizzling sound.

She didn't pause for a moment, immediately starting the next practice. The witch's uniform had been neatly folded and placed aside, and if it weren't for her insistence at the beginning, the clothes would probably have turned to ash in the flames by now.

Fortunately, as the fourth prince, it wasn't difficult for Roland to procure a few spares. He had Tyra bring over a whole barrel of robes—all temporarily collected from the maids.

The twenty-fourth practice finally saw some results; the flames no longer rose from her feet but instead appeared out of thin air in her palm. She carefully raised her arm, trying to move the flame to her fingertips, but the flame wavered and with a pop, it shot up her arm, igniting the sleeve and engulfing the robe along with it.

Anna extinguished the flame and emotionlessly tore off the half-charred robe, turning to the barrel to search for a new one.

At times like this, Roland would avert his gaze, focusing his eyes elsewhere—even though she didn't care about that at all.

In fact, if it weren't for Roland's strong insistence, she would probably practice completely nude. But then Roland wouldn't be able to watch properly; he truly couldn't remain calm in front of a young girl naked—especially when the silhouette of the young girl turned into a flame had a unique allure.

Roland shook his head, casting aside the distracting thoughts. As it stood, mastering this power was not an easy task. The interim goal he set for Anna was to release flames from the palm of her hand or her fingers without burning her clothes, and to maintain a high enough temperature to melt the iron ingots in the pool.

After the thirtieth practice failed, Roland called a halt.

"Take a break."

Anna stared at him blankly, unresponsive.

Roland had no choice but to walk over, take the girl's hand, and lead her to a chair, forcibly making her sit down.

"You're tired, it's time to rest when you're fatigued, no need to overdo it, we still have plenty of time," he wiped the sweat from her forehead, "let's have some afternoon tea first."



Roland knew that the nobles of the Kingdom of Greycastle did not have the custom of enjoying afternoon tea. The productivity of this world was so poor that people could hardly spare the time to enjoy delicate food—not to mention a fourth meal when three meals a day were not yet universal. As for the idle rich young masters, they usually gathered in bars or casinos at this time.



If there was no such custom, then he would create one. Pastries were readily available, and if there was no tea, beer could be used as a substitute—knowing that he was going to a remote border town, the Fourth Prince brought all his maids, servants, and chefs with him.



Thus, the first afternoon tea was held in the simple wooden shed in the castle's back garden.



Anna looked at the beautiful pastries with a bit of disbelief in her eyes. Why could food also be made to look so good?



Although she could not name the pastries specifically, the pure white appearance paired with the bright red fruits was appetizing in itself, especially with the delicate patterns dotted around the perimeter of the pastries. This once again made a deep impression on her worldview.



Roland looked on proudly as Anna was overwhelmed. It was just a strawberry cream cake, after all. Look how scared you are, you country bumpkin. Moreover, the strawberries were candied, so the taste was not fresh.



What was more interesting than eating was watching the witch's expressions. Roland watched her carefully put the cake into her mouth, her blue eyes almost shining, her hair swaying back and forth, and he suddenly had the illusion of watching a gourmet animation.



—Any cooking that does not glow is not good cooking!



Well, this feeling of character development was pretty good, too.



So watching Anna practice and joining her for afternoon tea became a routine in Roland's life. Even if he did not attend to government affairs himself, Barov would manage everything in an orderly manner for him.



Three days later, Barov delivered the organized documents of Border Town to Roland's office. This would have been an unbelievable event in the past—the Fourth Prince actually had the patience to look at such a big pile of tedious reports.



In fact, he did not have the patience now either. Roland only read two lines before feeling dizzy and simply said to Barov, "You read it to me."



After spending an hour listening to the report from his minister assistant, he noticed something amiss, "Why are Border Town's tax revenue and trade zero every winter?"



It was understandable that the low temperatures in winter would lead to decreased harvests, but zero meant something else entirely. Did the local people have the habit of hibernating?



Barov coughed twice, "Your Highness, have you forgotten? Winter is the Month of Demons, and Border Town has no defensive capabilities. All residents must relocate to Longsong Stronghold. But rest assured, your Highness's safety is definitely the top priority."



"Evil Spirit Moon?" Roland recalled the term—it seemed that there was such a term. Before this, he had not taken ghost stories or evil witches seriously, thinking they were just nonsensical superstitions of an uncivilized world. But now it seemed that, leaving aside whether they were evil or not, witches indeed existed. So... what about the other widely circulated ghost stories?



During his court lessons, the history tutor had gone into detail about the Evil Spirit Moon. After the first snowfall of each winter, when the sun turns dull and dim, the Gates of Hell in the Dragonspine Mountains would open at this moment.



The evil aura from hell would corrupt living beings, turning them into servants of the devil. Some animals would mutate into powerful evil beasts and launch attacks on humans. Witches were also mostly born during this season, and their powers were far greater than usual.



"Have you seen it? The Gates of Hell." Roland asked.



"Your Highness, how could ordinary people see it!" Barov shook his head repeatedly, "Not to mention that the Dragonspine Mountains are simply insurmountable, even getting close to the mountain range would affect one with the evil aura. At best, it causes severe headaches, at worst, it could lead to the loss of one's mind. Unless..."



"Unless what?"



"Unless that person is a witch. Only witches can see the Gates of Hell because they have fallen and become the minions of devils, naturally unaffected by the evil aura." Saying this, Barov even turned his head to glance towards the back garden.



"What about the evil beasts? You must have seen evil beasts, right?" Roland tapped the table with displeasure.



"Uh, I have not seen them. Like Your Highness, this is my first time coming to these borderlands. In the heart of the kingdom, Greycastle, it's very rare for anyone to encounter true evil."



Moving once a year, how could this place develop? Originally, he thought that Border Town was just barren land but with potential for development, but now it seemed like a huge pit.



"Longsong Stronghold can withstand the evil beasts, which means they can also be killed and are not invincible! So why can't we defeat them in Border Town?"



"Longsong Stronghold has massive walls and is garrisoned by Duke Ryan's elite troops. It's not something a small place like Border Town can compare to," Barov explained, "From the beginning, the purpose of establishing Border Town was to provide early warning to the stronghold, which is why it was set up between the Northern Slope Mine and the Redwater River."



Like cannon fodder placed in the enemy’s inevitable path, Roland sneered.
