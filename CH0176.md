## The answer in my heart.
The hot air balloon hovered in the air for half an hour before slowly descending into the castle courtyard.

As soon as the gondola touched the ground, the witches who were attracted by the hot air balloon gathered around—compared to when only Nightingale was present at the beginning, now the members of the Witch Union had almost all arrived, with Scroll even running over from the City Hall. After finding out what was happening, she kept looking up at the sky anxiously, fearing that the huge sphere might fall.

As soon as Prince Roland climbed out of the gondola, Scroll and Wendy immediately went up to lecture him, advising him not to take such risks with his own safety. After the prince offered a couple of retorts, he wisely diverted the topic to this new and novel contraption. Nightingale found it somewhat amusing and was about to join them when suddenly, she stiffened and stopped in her tracks.

She saw Anna, who was being held by Prince Roland as she exited the gondola, her eyes brimming with laughter, her cheeks tinged with a blush. Her flaxen bangs were neatly pushed to one side, adorned with a small and delicate clip that sparkled with a silvery light.

Nightingale remembered the silver ingot that he had casually ground a few days ago while instructing the blacksmiths on operating those bulky machines in the workshop.

Was that a hairpin made by His Highness himself?

The other witches also clamored to ride the hot air balloon, and soon, the envelope was inflated once more, this time carrying Anna and Nana aloft.

Nightingale stood outside the crowd, staring blankly as the hot air balloon grew smaller and smaller.

Her mind was filled with the tender smile that Anna wore.



Anna, who usually maintained a calm and indifferent expression on her face, rarely showed such a look — Nightingale, during her travels with the Mutual Aid Society, had seen many similar expressions in the streets and alleys of big cities. She knew what it meant; clearly, His Highness and Anna were not simply looking at the scenery above. Even though Lightning and Maggie were there, they couldn't possibly go that far, but once the thought emerged, it was difficult to suppress. Suddenly, Nightingale felt as if there was a void in her heart.



Although she had made her decision a long time ago, facing this moment, Nightingale found that she was far from being as indifferent as she had imagined.



She walked to a corner, sat down leaning against the wall, and looked at everyone's bustling with a blank mind.



The hot air balloon descended again, and after Nana climbed out of the basket, Leaf immediately took the opportunity to sit inside.



When Nightingale came back to her senses, Roland was no longer in the courtyard — probably after being lectured with books, he had returned to the castle to attend to his own work. She should have followed him to the office, staying by the prince's side as she had always done. But when Nightingale stood up, she found herself unable to take a step — she simply didn't know what kind of expression to face Roland with. Even if she entered the Mist and he couldn't see her, Nightingale was still clear that his happy demeanor would make her feel even worse.



So the hot air balloon went up and down, and probably after everyone had taken a turn, Wendy came over, "Why are you staying here? Don't you want to try it out? The feeling of overlooking the town from the sky is really great."



If there was anything more difficult to face than His Highness Roland, it was Anna. Nightingale stood up in a flurry, "No, I have to go back to the office." After saying that, she entered the Mist and took two steps before realizing, why was she using her ability in the courtyard? She turned back to look at Wendy, who was looking around with a puzzled face, and with a bite of her teeth, Nightingale quickly left.



...



After dinner, she returned to her bedroom and flopped down on the bed in all directions.



Today, until the very end, she did not show herself in the office. When His Highness tentatively called out her name, she only tapped him on the back with her hand twice to indicate that she was there. Even the sight of the salt-baked fish jerky that she usually coveted, taken from the mahogany desk, did not make her compromise.



"What's the matter, did something happen today?" Wendy walked into the bedroom and closed the door behind her, "I saw everyone boarding the hot air balloon, but you were sitting by yourself."



"It's nothing." Nightingale turned over.



"There is clearly something," Wendy sat by the bed, straightened her body, and looked at her for a long time, "I thought you were willing to share everything with me."



"..." The latter closed her eyes, and it took a long time before she murmured, "Because of Anna."



"Anna?"



Nightingale didn't want to talk about these troubles because it would only make her feel petty, especially since the first witch His Highness knew was Anna, not her. But if she didn't speak, her heart felt as if it was blocked by something, making it even more uncomfortable. At the Witch Cooperation Association, Wendy had given her a lot of help, and whenever she was confused, the first person she thought of was always Wendy, who had never let her down. Thinking of this, she gently held Wendy's hand and briefly explained the situation.



After listening, Wendy sighed, "Anna doesn't understand the importance of this matter, and neither do you? I reminded you last time, he cannot be together with a witch. Roland Wimbledon is the king and needs an heir to inherit the kingdom. From this point of view, he will never choose a witch as his wife."



"He will."



"What?" Wendy was stunned.

"Prince Roland is going to marry a witch," Nightingale suddenly opened her eyes and said word for word, "He said so himself!"

She had wanted to keep this news to herself, but now she couldn't bear the feeling of being misunderstood.

It seemed to take Wendy a while to recover before she frowned and asked, "Are you sure?"

"It's true," Nightingale repeated the conversation from that day, "When asked 'Is it possible for you to marry a witch?' his answer was 'Why not?' You know my ability, I can tell if someone is lying—when he said those words, he was serious."

Wendy suddenly grabbed Nightingale's arm, "Remember, you mustn't tell this to anyone else, not even the sisters of the Witch Union."

"Why... not?"

"Because he is destined to become the King of Greycastle, and what does a king without an heir mean? Even without the Church, the local nobles would find it difficult to support such a person as their king! Therefore, this matter must be kept a secret, absolutely not to be disclosed. What you need to do now is to ensure his safety, don't forget, whether he can become the ruler of Greycastle is related to the fate of all the sisters."

Nightingale nodded.



"As for the matter that's troubling you," Wendy pondered for a moment, "do you want to ascend to the position of queen, or do you simply wish to stay by His Highness's side?"



"Of course, I want to be by his side," Nightingale said without hesitation.



"Then aren't you already by his side?" Wendy smiled, "There can indeed be only one queen, but even if he ascends to the throne, he will still need your protection. Do you understand what I mean?"



Nightingale blinked and did not answer.



"So being together is not difficult to achieve, the hard part is accepting the choices you've made," Wendy spread her hands, "If you can't do that, then you only have to step back, or take a step further... As for this question, only you know the answer."



...

The next morning, Roland yawned as he walked into the office. He opened the drawer, only to find that the dried fish had vanished.
