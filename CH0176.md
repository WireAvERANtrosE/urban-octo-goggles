## The answer from the bottom of my heart
The hot air balloon remained aloft for half an hour before slowly descending into the castle courtyard.

As soon as the gondola touched the ground, the witches who had been drawn by the balloon crowded around it—compared to when only Nightingale was present at the beginning, members of the Witch Union had now all arrived, with Scroll even running over from the City Hall after hearing the news. She had been anxiously watching the sky ever since, fearing that the giant sphere might fall.



No sooner had His Highness climbed out of the gondola than Scroll and Wendy immediately began to lecture him, advising him not to take such risks with his person. After a couple of attempts at defending himself, the prince wisely deflected the topic to the novelty of the invention. Nightingale found the scene somewhat amusing and was about to join them when she suddenly froze in her tracks.



She saw Anna, cradled in Prince Roland's arms as she was helped out of the gondola, her eyes brimming with laughter and her cheeks tinged with a blush. Her flaxen bangs had been neatly swept to one side, and in her hair shone a small, exquisite clip, glittering with a silvery light.



Nightingale remembered how, a few days ago, he had casually filed a silver ingot while instructing the blacksmiths on operating those hefty machines in the workshop.



Was that hairpin made by His Highness himself?



The other witches also clamored for a ride in the hot air balloon, and soon enough, the envelope was inflated once more. This time, Anna and Nana went up into the sky.



Nightingale stood on the outskirts of the crowd, staring blankly as the balloon grew smaller and smaller.



Her mind was filled with the tender smile of Anna.



Anna, who usually maintained a calm and indifferent expression on her face, rarely showed such an expression—Nightingale had seen many similar expressions in the streets and alleys of large cities during her travels with the Mutual Aid Society, and she knew what it meant. Clearly, His Highness and Anna were not simply enjoying the view from above. Despite the presence of Lightning and Maggie, they couldn't possibly go that far, but once the thought emerged, it was hard to suppress. She suddenly felt as if there was a void in her heart.



Although she had made her decision a long time ago, when it came to face this moment, Nightingale found herself far from as indifferent as she had imagined.



She walked to a corner, sat down leaning against the wall, and watched everyone making a fuss, her mind a blank.



The hot-air balloon descended again, and after Nana climbed out of the basket, Leaves immediately took her chance to sit in it.



When Nightingale came back to her senses, Roland was no longer in the courtyard—probably after being lectured by books, he had returned to the castle to tend to his own work. She should have followed to the office, staying by the prince's side, as she had always done. But as Nightingale stood up, she found she couldn't move forward—she really didn't know with what expression to face Roland, even if he couldn't see her after she entered the Mist, but Nightingale was still clear that his happy appearance would make her feel worse.



So the hot-air balloon went up and down; probably everyone had taken a turn by then when Wendy came over, "Why are you staying here? Why not go up and try it? Looking down at the town from the sky feels absolutely wonderful."



If there was anything more difficult to face than His Highness Roland, it was Anna. Nightingale stood up in a panic, "No, I have to go back to the office." After saying that, she entered the Mist, took a couple of steps before realizing, why did she use her ability in the courtyard? She turned her head and saw Wendy looking around, a baffled expression on her face. Biting her lip, Nightingale quickly left.



...



After dinner, she returned to her bedroom and sprawled out on the bed, face up.



Today, until the very end, she had not shown herself in the office. When His Highness tentatively called out her name, she merely tapped twice on his back with her hand to signal that she was there. Even when he pulled out the salt-baked fish jerky from the mahogany desk, which usually made her drool, she did not give in.



"What's wrong, did something happen today?" Wendy walked into the bedroom, closing the door behind her. "I saw everyone boarding the hot air balloons, but you were sitting alone on the side."



"It's nothing." Nightingale turned over.



"There's clearly something," Wendy sat on the edge of the bed, straightened her out, and stared at her for a while, "I thought you were willing to share everything with me."



"..." The latter closed her eyes and after a long while, she murmured, "Because of Anna."



"Anna?"



Nightingale did not want to speak of these troubling thoughts because it would only make her feel petty, especially since the first witch His Highness had met was Anna, not her. But if she kept silent, her heart would feel as if it were blocked, making her more uncomfortable. During her time in the Witch Cooperation Association, Wendy had given her a lot of help. Whenever she was lost, the first person she thought of was always Wendy, and she had never let her down. With this in mind, she gently held Wendy's hand and roughly explained the situation.



After hearing everything, Wendy sighed, "Anna doesn't understand the importance of this matter, and neither do you? I've reminded you before, he cannot be with a witch. Roland Wimbledon is a king; he needs an heir to inherit the kingdom, and from that perspective, he would never choose a witch as his wife."



"He will."



"What?" Wendy was stunned.

"Prince Roland will marry a witch," Nightingale suddenly opened her eyes and spoke word by word, "He said it himself!"

She had intended to keep this news to herself, but now she could no longer bear the feeling of being misunderstood.

It seemed Wendy was shocked, and after a long while, she frowned and asked, "Are you sure?"

"It's true," Nightingale repeated the conversation from that day, "When asked 'Is it possible for you to marry a witch?' his answer was 'Why not'. You know my ability, I can tell if someone is lying—and he was serious when he said that."

Wendy suddenly grabbed Nightingale's arm, "Remember, you must not tell anyone else this, not even the sisters of the Witch Union."

"Why... not?"

"Because he is destined to become the King of Greycastle, and what does a king without an heir mean? Even without the Church, the local nobles would have a hard time supporting such a person as their king! So this matter must be kept a secret, absolutely not to be disclosed. What you need to do now is ensure his safety, don't forget, whether he can become the ruler of Greycastle is related to the fate of all the sisters."

Nightingale nodded.



"As for the matter that troubles you," Wendy pondered for a moment, "do you want to ascend to the position of queen, or do you simply wish to stay by His Highness's side?"

"Of course, to stay by his side," Nightingale said without hesitation.

"Then aren't you already by his side now?" Wendy smiled, "There is indeed only one queen, but even if he ascends to the throne, he will still need your protection. Do you understand what I'm saying?"

Nightingale blinked and did not reply.

"So being together is not difficult to achieve, the difficulty lies in accepting the choices you've made," Wendy spread her hands and said, "If you can't do that, you only have to step back or go even further... As for this question, only you know the answer."

...

The next morning, Roland yawned as he entered his office. He opened the drawer, only to discover that the dried fish had vanished without a trace.
