## Spy (Part 1)
"Mole" Cole looked anxiously out of the window.

Although this damned place starts snowing nonstop, and the sky is as dirty and gray as his grandmother's unwashed bedsheets for years, he still had other ways to tell the time.

That was the militia's training. As long as the weather permitted, they would run across the town center's plaza every morning at the sparrow hour (8 o'clock). Before the Evil Months arrived, these idiots had been doing just that, and now they were still at it. Don't these people know that conserving energy is the most important thing in winter? When it's truly time to flee for your lives, you'll probably be begging the gods to grant you an extra pair of legs. But thanks to these fools, he could determine the approximate time of departure.

That's right, he wanted to escape this cursed town! Even though His Highness the Second Prince had ordered him to stay undercover in Border Town, to observe the movements of the Fourth Prince, Roland Wimbledon, and send back intelligence to the city of Valencia, he didn't want to stay a moment longer.

He feared that in another half a month, he would become sacrifices to the devil along with the other residents.

This was no exaggeration!

Ever since the onset of winter, strange and bizarre things had been happening nonstop here. Others might not have noticed yet—which was not surprising, as most of the townsfolk were ignorant country bumpkins who cared about nothing but food and didn't even hold the gods in regard. But he was different; he was "Mole" Cole! Gathering information and stealing intelligence were his specialties; that's why His Highness Timothy had picked him for this job.

The city walls that sprang up overnight, the iron rods that made strange noises and could knock down demonic beasts, of course, none of these compared to his most astonishing discovery.

The illustrious Fourth Prince of the kingdom was actually openly raising a witch!



Heaven is merciful, could there be anything more exaggerated than this? If the prince wasn't being controlled by the devil, he couldn't think of any other explanation!

Even if the prince wanted to indulge in a witch's novelty, he could lock her up in the castle and do whatever he pleased—Kohl had heard more than once about nobles keeping witches in secret. These witches, whom nobody would care about even if they died, were very suitable for some nobles with peculiar tastes. But to bring them out in the open was a whole different matter.

This was not his wild imagination, but what he had witnessed with his own eyes!

Following the principle of serving those who pay him, Kohl would stroll near the city walls every day when the snow was not too heavy, where he often saw the figure of the Fourth Prince. He had always wondered what gave this incompetent spendthrift prince the courage to stay in Border Town instead of fleeing back to Longsong Stronghold in a sorry state. Now he understood completely, Roland Wimbledon had already been replaced by the devil!

He saw with his own eyes the city wall being breached by a huge demonic beast, the devil killing it with thunderous strikes, and the swarms of demonic beasts that followed were engulfed by the hellfire summoned by a witch, and in the end, this witch even threw herself into the prince's arms— and the entire militia did not raise any objections!

Afterward, he heard a variety of rumors from his neighbors, saying there was another witch with healing abilities. What nonsense about someone's son being cured of his injuries, or the old lady across the street who had fallen and broken her leg on the icy road also being healed—it was all blasphemous! Accepting treatment from a witch? Was that any different from accepting corruption from the devil?

What made Kohl resolute was something he had seen two days earlier; he personally witnessed a witch flying out of the prince's castle, circling around it twice before flying back in. The priests in the church often said that a witch, once tempted by the devil, could only obtain one kind of power, yet he had seen at least fire and flight, not to mention the rumors of the healing witch, which meant that this small town was harboring three witches!

Without a doubt, the devil had turned the lord's castle into a den for a demonic gathering, and the residents of this place were gradually being controlled. He must escape from here as quickly as possible. After all, he held the secret to the rapid construction of the town's walls; if he offered the alchemical powder he had stolen from the walls to the Second Prince, surely he would not only avoid punishment but would also be handsomely rewarded.

The more Kohl thought about it, the more he regretted not returning to Longsong Stronghold with the other nobles who had withdrawn.



Now, if he wanted to leave this place, the land route was definitely impossible. The snowstorms that lasted the entire winter would cover all the roads. His only chance was to take a merchant ship from Willow Town and leave by waterway.



According to Cole's observations, on the first day of every month, ships from Willow Town would come carrying food. After two to three hours of unloading and loading, they would set sail and leave the dock. He had to take this opportunity to sneak onto the ship, or else he would have to wait until the next month.



And today was the first day of the month.



"One, two, three, four, one two three four." Just then, Cole heard the familiar chant. Outside the window, a group of young men dressed in brown leather armor ran past energetically. If he had not already seen through the devil's conspiracy, he would have certainly been fooled by this spirited scene.



It was time to set off, he thought.



Putting on his fur coat and tightening his belt, Cole walked out of the wooden cabin. His neighbor was outside collecting dried fish and greeted him, "Heading out so early?"



It had to be said, although the lord of Border Town had been controlled by the devil, the lives of these ignorant people had actually improved quite a bit. They even dared to hang fish to dry outside—knowing that if people were starving, they would swallow the fish dry as hard as rocks.



But Cole had no time to respond to the neighbor. He glanced at the militia team disappearing to the west and headed straight for the dock. The residents here all thought he was Iron Paddle's brother, who had come from Dragon Cliffs City to visit relatives—of course, it was all made up. Before he took care of Iron Paddle, he had learned the man's name and address and then posed as his brother to lie low here. As for the fabricated identity, he couldn't care less whether these fools believed it or not.



The snow on the stone-paved road had been cleared a few days ago and was now almost covering the tops of his boots. He maintained an even pace to conserve energy—as for the footprints he left behind, he wasn't worried; in at most one day, the snow would cover them again. Perhaps by the time he reached the city of Valencia, they would still be in the dark.



As Cole approached the dock, he saw the long-awaited Willow Town sailboat.



Bags of wheat were being moved out of the ship's hold, guarded by soldiers. He felt his pocket, containing only two Gold royals and sixteen Silver royals, his entire fortune. There were six guards, and the Silver royals wouldn't be enticing enough for them, while he didn't have enough Gold royals to go around, so he set his sights on the porters. The stacked goods provided a blind spot, and knocking out a porter to take his place was precisely the kind of job he excelled at. If he could bluff his way onto the ship, he believed that under the temptation of the Gold royals, the captain would very likely hide him away and take him aboard.



Just as Cole was about to make his move, a shouting voice came from behind him.



Realizing something was amiss, he turned around and saw several members of the Militia approaching him, and people were closing in on his side as well; clearly, he was surrounded.



Seeing that escape was hopeless, Cole immediately raised his hands and knelt down. In his line of work, it was crucial never to resist stubbornly. As long as he spilled all the information about his employer, he would generally come out unscathed, or... they might even hire him themselves for a higher price.



Doing as much work as the money was worth was also "Groundhog" Cole's principle.



He just didn't understand how he had been discovered.
