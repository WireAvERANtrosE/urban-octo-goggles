## Ancient Ruins
The further we sailed eastward, the thinner the fog became, but the sky remained overcast as if the sunlight could not penetrate this sea area.

The surrounding reefs grew taller, gradually turning into stout stone pillars. For some reason, even though the water level was clearly falling, the ship's speed remained smooth, and even the waves on the sea reduced, becoming as calm as a windless lake.

"Why don't you wait for the tide to go out completely before entering the Hidden Sea?" Tilly asked, puzzled. "Once the reefs are all exposed, you wouldn't have to worry about running aground, right?"

"Because once the tide is out, we won't be able to see the Specter Red River anymore, and it's the only guide for explorers heading to the ruins," Thunder explained. "These pillar-like islands are not fixed; with every high and low tide, their positions change. Moreover, most markers are submerged by the sea, so they can't be used for navigation."

"Specter... Red River?" she repeated.

"Exactly. Look, there it is—" Thunder whistled and pointed towards the bow of the ship.

The witches looked in the direction he pointed, and in the dark green sea water, a few red figures appeared—they flickered past like phantoms. But soon, another two or three red shadows drifted by, and this time Ashes saw the target clearly—it was a fish that was entirely orange-red.

"Is this... a fish?"

"It's the unique Redscale Fish of the Shadow Islands," Thunder said, stroking his chin with a smile. "Soon, you'll see the true face of the Specter Red River."



Gradually, more and more fish began to appear, no longer in small groups, but rather congregating into a mass, collectively swimming towards the direction of the ship's stern—looking far ahead, Ashes was shocked by the scene before her. An increasing number of fish joined this torrent, and a dark red streak had appeared in the sea. The sailboat was clearly navigating along this red line; the school of fish swam under the ship, and from time to time, one could hear the clanging sounds of collisions.



So that's how it is, she suddenly realized, this is the Specter Stream— an extraordinary river that doesn't actually exist! As the ship continued to advance, the dense school of fish had expanded into a channel wide enough to accommodate several ships side by side. The dark green sea seemed to vanish, and the sailboat appeared to be sailing atop the fish. If it weren't for the fact that they were moving in opposite directions, she might even have the illusion that the ship was being carried by the fish.



"Why is this happening?" Tilly asked in surprise.



Ashes also wanted to ask the same question. In Greycastle or any other kingdom, one would never see such a sight— the surrounding fog, the gloomy sky, the strangely shaped boulders, and the "river" made up of Redscale fish. It was the first time she had been awed by the wonders of the sea.



"It's because of the main island," Thunder said, "It's like a triangular spire with a huge hole running through the middle of it. These Redscale fish like to lay their eggs in the hole and breed. And when the tide goes out, the hole will emerge from the water, and the fish dwelling there will be the first to sense the change in water level and swarm out. So as long as we follow the Specter Stream, we can reach the Shadow Main Island."



"Lord Thunder, there's a huge obstacle ahead! It looks like a mountain!" the lookout shouted.



"It seems we are almost there," he knocked out his pipe, "Ladies, welcome to the Hidden Islands."



In a short while, Ashes also saw the shape of the main island, just as Thunder had described. It looked like several triangles pieced together, wide at the bottom and narrow at the top, and its surface appeared quite smooth at first glance, hardly resembling a natural formation. However, to say that the entire spire was carved out by humans would be astonishing. The exposed part of the spire was almost the size of half a city, and the hole in the middle was large enough to accommodate the cathedral spire of the Church of Hermes.



The sea continued to recede, and the water accumulated at the top of the giant hole poured down like a waterfall, while the submerged part below was completely covered by the school of fish, turning the visible area of the sea into a deep red. Ashes couldn't help but think, the Redscale fish living inside the hole must number in the millions.



It wasn't until the sky darkened that the seawater finally receded to the bottom of the cave. Seizing this opportunity, Thunder ordered the sailors to stop the ship and moor it to the shore, tying it with thick hemp ropes to the copper stakes at the entrance of the cave. Standing on the edge of the giant hole, one could see the passage on the opposite side from afar—the light entering from both ends could only illuminate a very small area, leaving the center of the cavity almost pitch black, creating an inexplicably oppressive feeling.



"Are these stakes something you left behind last time you came here?" Ashes asked.



"No," Thunder shook his head, "The copper stakes were already here the first time I came. They must have been built by the owner of the ruins."



"Ruins... where?"



He smiled and pointed upwards, "Right above our heads, we are already standing at the entrance to the ruins."



...



The journey that followed could only be described as incredible. The witches, following Thunder and his men, entered through a stone door at the bottom of the giant hole, and followed a stone staircase with trickling water, spiraling upwards step by step. Although everyone was holding torches, the flickering flames seemed feeble and insignificant compared to the seemingly endless staircase.



Advancing in the abyss-like darkness, Tilly clung tightly to Ashes' arm, completely devoid of her usual calm and composed demeanor.



This is the princess I know, Ashes thought. In the palace, this confident Fifth Princess, who always had her own ideas and faced any difficulty with confidence, had her greatest weakness—fear of the dark. Even at night, she needed candles lit in her room to sleep. When fleeing the palace, if conditions did not allow for it, Ashes had to stay by her side until she fell asleep.



Walking inside the damp and gloomy spire, Ashes' mood actually became much more pleasant.



Along the way, they did not encounter any demonic beasts, nor any mechanisms to obstruct invaders—Even if there were any, after being soaked in seawater for such a long time, they would have likely been rendered ineffective. The only problem was that the long climb had exhausted most of the party's strength, and everyone's movements became increasingly sluggish. When the stone steps finally came to an end, a cheer involuntarily erupted from the group.



The last barrier of the ruins was not a stone door, but one made of metal, which reflected brightly under the torchlight. Thunder pushed the door with both hands, and the heavy door panel made a grating noise as it slowly opened.



Ashes, holding her sword in one hand, was the first to enter the room. After looking around to make sure there was no danger, she let Tilly and the other witches step into the room.



As torches were hung all around the walls, a spacious hall appeared before them—although it was wide, it still seemed empty, with nothing much to inspect at a glance.



"Is this the relic?" She caressed the stone tabletop that had turned green from the soaking water, "Apart from some stone tables and chairs, there's nothing here."



"Indeed, there's little left," Thunder nodded, "It has been slumbering under the sea for too long; apart from stone, hardly anything else could have been preserved. I've also mentioned this to Princess Tilly, but she insisted on coming to see for herself."



"What about those red stones?" Tilly spoke up, "Where did you find them?"



"They were on the ground, scattered all over the place, probably a few dozen of them."



However, now there was nothing left. Ashes looked down at the slippery ground now covered in seaweed. Thunder was not the only explorer who had reached this place. After being scavenged over and over, it would have been strange to find any magic stones left.



But Tilly was still full of enthusiasm. She held up a torch and carefully examined every corner of the hall, and for the particularly dark spots, she had the sailors add a few more torches. Mollie summoned her magical servants to spread out and flatten on the ground, providing everyone with mats to rest on. Ashes followed Tilly closely, watching her feel around on the walls.



"Eh," suddenly, the fifth princess stopped in her tracks, "What is this?"



Ashes followed her gaze and saw a patch of green moss on the wall reflecting some firelight.



Tilly reached out to tear off the green moss, revealing a gemstone embedded in the stone wall—it was also bright red, crystal clear like a magic stone, prism-shaped, and about as thick as an arm, but it was surrounded by golden threads, as if a slot had secured it in place. Even after being soaked in the sea for so long, the gold threads around the stone were still as bright as new.



Tilly tried to pull it out, but the gemstone did not budge.



"Let me try," Ashes said.



The fifth princess shook her head, seemingly in thought, then she placed her hand on the prism and closed her eyes.



Suddenly, a light flashed from the center of the prism—Ashes thought she was seeing things, but soon a rumbling echo came from behind the wall, as if some mechanism had been triggered, and in a short while it spread throughout the entire hall. There were creaking friction noises all over the stone wall, and bunches of soft white light suddenly appeared from the walls, even the ceiling overhead started to light up.



The sailors panicked and stood up, drawing their weapons without knowing which side to defend. In the end, they could only huddle back to back, closely packed together, forming a circle around Molly's magic servant.

However, no monsters charged out.

When the noises subsided and calm returned, the hall was brightly lit.
