## Ancient Ruins
As we continued eastward, the fog thinned, but the sky remained overcast, as if the sunlight couldn't penetrate this stretch of sea.

The surrounding reefs grew taller, gradually turning into robust columns of rock. Oddly enough, even though the water level was clearly dropping, the ship's speed remained steady, and the sea was so calm it resembled a windless lake.

"Why don't you wait for the tide to completely recede before entering the Shadow Sea?" Tilly asked, puzzled. "Once all the reefs are exposed, you wouldn't have to worry about running aground."

"Because once the tide is out, we can't see the Specter Red River, which is the only guide for explorers to find the ruins," Thunder explained. "These column-like islands are not fixed; their positions change with every high and low tide. Moreover, most markers are submerged by the sea, so they cannot be used for navigation."

"The Specter... Red River?" she repeated.

"That's right. Look, over there—" Thunder whistled and pointed toward the bow.

The witches looked in the direction he indicated and saw several red shadows appear in the dark green sea—flitting by like phantoms. But soon, two or three more red shadows drifted past, and this time Ashes saw them clearly—they were entirely orange-red fish.

"Are these... fish?"

"Unique to the Shadow Islands, these are the Redscale fish," Thunder said with a smile, stroking his beard. "You'll soon see the true face of the Specter Red River."



Gradually, the number of fish increased, and they no longer appeared in twos and threes but gathered into a group, collectively swimming towards the direction of the stern—looking ahead from afar, Ashes was shocked by the scene she witnessed. More and more fish joined the torrent, and a thick, dark red line had appeared in the sea. The sailboat was clearly following this red line, with fish swimming under the boat, occasionally making clanging collision sounds.



So that's how it is, she suddenly realized, this is the Ghost Shadow Red River—a peculiar river that does not exist! As the ship continued to advance, the dense school of fish expanded into a channel wide enough to accommodate several ships side by side. The dark green sea water seemed to vanish, with the sailboat traveling as if it was on top of the fish. If it weren't for the fact that their directions were exactly opposite, she might even have the illusion that the ship was being carried by the fish.



"Why is it like this?" Tilly asked in surprise.



Ashes also wanted to ask this question. In Greycastle or any other kingdom, one would definitely never see such a sight—the mist enveloping the surroundings, the gloomy sky, the strangely shaped boulders, and the "river" formed by the Redscale fish. It was the first time she was so awed by the wonders of the sea.



"It's because of the main island," Thunder said. "It's like a triangular spire with a huge hollow in the middle piercing through the tower. These Redscale fish like to spawn and reproduce in the hollow. When the tide falls, the hollow will emerge from the water, and the residing fish will always be the first to feel the change in water level and swarm out. So as long as we follow the Ghost Shadow Red River, we can reach Shadow's main island."



"Lord Thunder, there is a huge obstacle ahead! It looks just like a mountain!" the lookout shouted.



"It looks like we're almost there," he knocked out his pipe. "Ladies, welcome to the Shadow Islands."



Before long, Ashes also saw the shape of the main island, just as Thunder had said. It looked like several triangles put together, wide at the bottom and narrow at the top, the surface looking quite flat at first glance, not like a natural formation at all. But to say that the entire tower was carved out by people would be even more astonishing. The exposed part of the tower alone was almost the size of half a city, and the hollow in the middle was big enough to accommodate the spire of a Hermes Church.



The sea was still receding, and the accumulated water at the top of the huge hollow fell down like a waterfall, while the submerged part was completely covered by the school of fish, dyeing the sea within sight a thorough red. Ashes couldn't help but think to herself that there must be millions of Redscale fish living in that hollow.



It wasn't until the sky darkened that the sea completely receded to the bottom of the cave. Seizing this opportunity, Thunder commanded the sailors to stop the ship and moor it to the shore, connecting it to the copper stakes at the entrance of the cave with thick hemp ropes. Standing at the edge of the giant cave, one could see the thoroughfare on the opposite side—light entering from both ends could only illuminate a very small area, the center of the void was almost pitch black, creating an inexplicably oppressive feeling.



"Did you leave these stakes here last time you came?" Ashes asked.



"No," Thunder shook his head, "the copper stakes were already here when I first came. They must have been built by the owner of the ruins."



"Ruins... Where are they?"



He smiled and pointed upwards, "Right above our heads. We're already standing at the entrance to the ruins."



...



The journey that followed could only be described as incredible. The witches, following Thunder and his men, entered through a stone door at the bottom of the giant cave, ascending a flight of stone stairs with water trickling down them, spiraling upwards step by step. Although everyone was holding torches, the flickering flames seemed weak and insignificant compared to the endless staircase.



Walking through the abyss-like darkness, Tilly tightly grasped Ashes' arm, completely devoid of her usual calm and collected demeanor.



This is the princess I know, Ashes thought. In the palace, the fifth princess, always full of her own ideas and brimming with confidence in the face of any difficulty, had a major weakness—she was afraid of the dark. Even at night when sleeping, candles had to be lit in her room. When fleeing the palace, if it wasn't possible to do so, it was always Ashes who stayed by her side until she fell asleep.



Walking within the damp and dark spire, Ashes' mood actually became much more pleasant.

Along the way, they didn't encounter any demonic beasts, nor any mechanisms to obstruct invaders—although if there had been any, they probably would have been rendered ineffective by the long-term soaking of seawater. The only problem was that the long climb had exhausted most of the group's physical strength, and everyone's movements became slower and slower. When the stone steps finally came to an end, cheers of relief inevitably arose among the team.

The last barrier of the ruins was not a stone door but one made of metal, which reflected brightly under the torchlight. Thunder pushed the door with both hands, and as the heavy door panels made a grating noise, they slowly opened.

Ashes entered the room first, sword in hand, and after making sure there were no dangers, she allowed Tilly and the other witches to step into the room.

As torches were hung on the walls all around, a spacious hall appeared before everyone—spacious, yet empty and barren, with nothing to ponder over at a glance.

"Is this the relic?" she rubbed the stone table that had been soaked green by water, "Apart from some stone tables and stools, there's nothing here."

"Indeed, little is left," Thunder nodded, "It has slept under the sea for too long, and apart from stone, it's difficult for anything else to be preserved. I've also mentioned this to Princess Tilly, but she insisted on coming to see for herself."

"What about those red stones?" Tilly asked, "Where did you find them?"

"They were just on the ground, scattered about. There must've been dozens of them."



However, now there was nothing left. Ashes looked down at the slippery ground that had already begun to sprout seaweed. Thunder was not the only explorer who had reached this place. It would have been strange if there were still magic stones to be found after so many had scoured the area in turns.



But Tilly was still full of enthusiasm. She held a torch and carefully examined every corner of the hall, and for the especially dark places, she had the sailors add a few more torches. Scroll summoned her magic servants, spread them out on the ground to provide a resting mat for everyone, while Ashes followed Tilly, watching her feel around the walls.



"Hey," suddenly, the fifth princess stopped in her tracks, "What is this?"



Ashes looked in the direction of her gaze and saw a patch of green moss on the wall reflecting some firelight.



Tilly reached out and tore off the green moss, revealing a gemstone half-buried in the rock wall—it was also bright red, crystal clear like a magic stone, prism-shaped, and about as thick as an arm, but it was surrounded by fine gold threads, as if a slot held it in place. Despite having been soaked in seawater for so long, the gold threads around the stone were still as shiny as new.



Tilly tried to pull it out, but the gemstone did not budge.



"Let me try," Ashes said.



The fifth princess shook her head, as if contemplating something, then she placed her hand on the prism and closed her eyes.



Suddenly, a light flashed from the center of the prism—Ashes thought she was seeing things, but soon a rumbling echo came from behind the wall, as if some mechanism had been triggered, and it quickly spread throughout the entire hall. The stone walls made creaking friction noises, and bunches of soft white light suddenly appeared on the walls, even the ceiling overhead lit up.



The sailors panicked and stood up, each drawing their weapons without knowing which direction to defend from, and ultimately could only huddle back to back, closely around Molier's magic servant, forming a tight group.

However, no monsters charged out.

When the noise settled down, the hall was brightly lit.
