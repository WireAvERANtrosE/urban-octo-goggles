## Witch's Disease
Over the next two days, Tassa constantly shuttled between the Margrave Chamber of Commerce and the outskirts of the royal capital.

The ships that took away the refugees were provided by the Margrave, while the First Army would dress as mercenaries and go to the canal wharf at the agreed time to arrange for the refugees to board the ships.

As for spreading the message and luring people in, Black Hammer and his team were already well-practiced, so Tassa was not worried about that. It was much more convenient for the Rats to do this kind of work than outsiders, and although their range was only in the North District, the refugees would surely spread the word among themselves. Moreover, he could not take everyone away at once; His Highness had instructed that this matter could be done slowly, and taking away one shipload at a time was progress.

On the day the fleet arrived, nearly a thousand displaced refugees came to the wharf, an outcome that surprised Tassa. If it had been only the First Army spreading the word, having a hundred people believe them would have been good enough.

Following Prince Roland's selection criteria, he first let the children board the ships, followed by families with children, and finally, the adults. As for the elderly... he noticed that there were almost no old people with white hair among the crowd. Perhaps they were unwilling to venture to a remote place again, or maybe they simply did not have the strength to flee from the Eastern Region to the royal capital.

The first fleet, consisting of ten single-masted sailboats, set off carrying more than five hundred people, and the remaining people were sent back to the camp. However, they also brought back the message that "the fleet will come again."

Tassa thought that the first task entrusted by His Highness would be successfully completed without issue, but not long after the merchant fleet took away the second group of people, he encountered a troublesome problem.

A strange illness suddenly appeared in the royal city.

The first discovered victim was lying on the side of the road, with patches of black spots on his body, teeth fallen out, skin cracked open, and blood flowing out that had changed color—just as horrific as when a witch was devoured by demonic power. However, the victim was not a woman, but a male civilian living in the North District.



Subsequent to that, several more bodies displaying the same symptoms were discovered, and those who had come into contact with the corpses began to develop black spots on their skin. No matter whether they used herbal remedies or cold compresses, nothing could make the spots disappear. When they resorted to bloodletting treatments, the blood that flowed out was dark, tinged with red but as if mixed with a great deal of ink.



Fear quickly spread among the populace, and the number of people flocking to the church to pray steadily increased. But it was all to no avail; more and more people bore the black spots on their bodies, and even refugees outside the city began to show the same symptoms.



The Grand Bishop of the Church stepped forward, proclaiming that this was a conspiracy of the witches, who had released the power of devils to infect innocent people. At present, no treatment could withstand the power of the evil spirits, and those who were infected would die in extreme pain. However, the Church would not sit idly by; they had already developed a sacred medicine capable of containing the hellish demonic force.



This declaration gave the infected a glimmer of hope, and they gathered around the church's entrance daily, waiting for the distribution of the holy medicine.



Although Tassa was doubtful about the Church's claims, he decided to suspend the transportation of refugees just to be cautious.



"Why stop?" Black Hammer expressed his utter incomprehension, "Now that those folks are also infected by demonic power, shouldn't we hurry up and send them far away? Do we want them to stay outside the city and become seeds for the witches?"



"It's the higher-ups' decision," he replied impatiently, "It's still manageable with just ordinary refugees, but if the Western Region also gets infected by this evil force, what would become of the Kingdom?"



"Uh—" Black Hammer paused briefly, "But what happens to the Western Region isn't our concern, right, Lord Tassa? Why don't you just pretend you didn't hear the higher-ups and get rid of them all? Just think, this damned thing can infect you with just a touch; I don't want to be around a bunch of hellish devils, even if there's a wall between us."



"Pretend I didn't hear it? I have only one head," Tassa said coldly, "and so do you. Do as I say!"



After leaving the tavern, he found a shop marked with the Magali Caravan's emblem and showed his token.

"I need to see your boss, and the sooner the better."

He didn't have to wait long before he was once again in the presence of the female merchant in the shop's secret room.

"This illness definitely has nothing to do with witches," Magali began. "If the evil power released could not even be resisted by the Divine Stone of Judgement, they would have turned Hermes into a dead land long ago."

"I think so too, but the priority is to report this matter to Prince Roland. Although the two groups of people who boarded the ship did not show symptoms of the black spots, it seems that the disease does not manifest immediately. If someone on the ship is infected with the demonic power, Border Town must respond immediately." Tassa took out a folded letter from his embrace, "I need your help to get this letter back to His Highness as soon as possible."

"Of course," she nodded, "the exchange of information among merchants is always the fastest."

...

Several consecutive days of sailing made Lucia feel nauseous.

In the last month, she seemed to be constantly fleeing—first from the Eastern Region to the King's City and then from the King's City to the Western Region. However, the former was because she was driven out of her homeland, while the latter was her last hope from the bottom of her heart.



"Sister... water, I'm thirsty..."

Ling let out a painful moan, reaching out to grasp her arm.

"Alright, I'll get you some water."

Lucia grabbed the cloth bag by her side, staggered out of the cabin, and leaned over to the lowest part of the ship's side, dipping the bag into the river. The acid in her stomach surged up again, and she couldn't hold it back, finally vomiting out loud. The little oatmeal in her stomach was thrown up completely, and even her nostrils were filled with the sour liquid. She resisted the urge to burst into tears, clenched her teeth, wiped her face roughly with the back of her hand, and continued to soak the bag. Only when the bag was full of water did she hold it in her arms and hurry back to the cabin.

"Here's the water, open your mouth."

But Ling's complexion was worse than before, with an abnormal flush on her cheeks and her forehead burning hot. She kept her lips tightly closed, uttering intermittent moans.

Lucia had no choice but to pry her mouth open, twist the cloth bag tight, and let the water drip into her sister's mouth.

"Don't get too close to her. The black spots have spread to her neck; she won't last long," said a weak middle-aged man in the cabin. "We're all going to die here; you better take care of yourself."

Not long after leaving the capital, people on the boat contracted a terrible disease. It started with a fever, then black spots appeared on the skin, and the condition rapidly worsened after three or four days. Not only would the sufferer fall into a coma, but they would also infect anyone who came into contact with them. Therefore, on the fifth day, the fleet had specially cleared out a sailboat to carry the sick. Lucia guessed that the reason they didn't throw all the sick refugees into the river was that their own people had also become infected.



After black spots appeared on Ling's body, she ignored the advice of others and resolutely followed her sister onto this ship filled with the sick.

To take care of the young Ling, she had barely closed her eyes for two days.

Lucia still did not give up; she believed that everything would get better once they arrived in the Western Region.

If the rumors were true… the Union would be her last hope.
