## Devil's Plague
Over the next two days, Theo shuttled non-stop between the Margrave Chamber of Commerce and the outskirts of the royal capital. The ships used to take away the refugees were provided by the Margrave, while the First Army would pretend to be mercenaries and go to the canal docks at the agreed time to arrange for the refugees to board the ships.



As for spreading the news and luring people in, Black Hammer and his group were already adept at it, so Theo was not worried about that. It was much more convenient for the Rats to do this kind of thing than for outsiders, and although their scope was limited to the North District, the news would surely spread among the refugees. Moreover, he could not take everyone away at once. His Highness had explained that they could take their time with this matter—saving one shipload was better than none.



On the day that the fleet arrived, nearly a thousand displaced refugees came to the docks, an effect that was beyond Theo's expectations. If it had only been the First Army doing the promotion, having a hundred people believe them would have been good enough.



Following Prince Roland's selection criteria, he first allowed the children to board, then families with children, and finally the adults. As for the elderly... he noticed that there were almost no white-haired old people in the crowd. Perhaps they were unwilling to venture to a remote place again, or perhaps they simply did not have the strength to flee from the Eastern Region to the royal capital.



The first fleet, consisting of ten single-masted sailboats, set off with over five hundred people, and the remaining people were driven back to the camp. However, they also took back with them the message that "the fleet will come again."



Theo originally thought that he could smoothly complete the first task assigned by His Highness, but not long after the merchant fleet took away the second batch of people, he encountered a troublesome problem.



A strange disease suddenly appeared in the royal city.



The first discovered victim was found lying on the side of the road, his body covered with blotches of black spots, his teeth had fallen out, his skin cracked open, and the blood that flowed out had changed color—it was as horrific as when a witch was devoured by the power of evil demons. However, the victim was not a woman but a male civilian living in the North District.



In the following days, several more bodies with the same symptoms were discovered, and those who had come into contact with the bodies began to develop black spots on their skin. No matter whether they used herbal remedies or cold compresses, the spots could not be made to fade. Even when bloodletting was attempted, the blood was dark red with a tinge of black, as if a great deal of ink had been mixed in.



Fear quickly spread among the people, and the number who went to the church to pray increased by the day. Yet all was in vain. More and more people were showing the black spots, even the refugees outside the city were exhibiting the same symptoms.



The Grand Bishop of the church stepped forward. He declared that this was a witch's conspiracy, that they had unleashed the devil's power to infect other innocents. At present, no treatment could resist the power of the evil demon, and those who were corrupted would die in extreme agony. However, the church would not sit idly by; they had already developed a Holy Spirit medicine capable of containing this hellish devil's evil force.



His proclamation gave the infected a glimmer of hope, and they gathered around the church entrance every day, waiting for the distribution of the Holy Medicine.



Theo, however, was deeply skeptical of the church's claims, but just in case, he temporarily halted the transportation of refugees.



"Why stop?" Black Hammer asked, unable to comprehend, "Now that those guys are also corrupted by the demonic power, shouldn't we send them far away quickly? Do you want to leave them outside the city to become seeds for the witches?"



"It's the higher-ups' decision," he replied impatiently, "Ordinary refugees are one thing, but if the Western Territory is also infected by this evil force, what would the kingdom become?"



"Uh—" Black Hammer was momentarily at a loss for words, "But what happens to the Western Territory isn't our concern, right? Lord Theo, why not just pretend you didn't hear the higher-ups and get rid of them all? Think about it, this kind of cursed thing could corrupt you just by contact. I don't want to stay with a bunch of hellish devils, even a wall apart."



"Pretend I didn't hear it? I've only got one head," Theo said coldly, "and you've only got one too. Do as I say!"



After leaving the tavern, he found a shop marked with the emblem of the Margret caravan and showed his token.

"I need to see your boss, the sooner the better."

It wasn't long before he saw the female merchant again in the secret room of the shop.

"This disease is definitely not related to witches," Margret began. "If the evil power released was something not even the God's Punishment Stones could resist, then they would have turned Hermes into a dead land long ago."

"I think so too, but the priority now is to report this matter to Prince Roland. Although the two groups of people who boarded the ship did not show symptoms of the black spots, it seems that the disease does not manifest on the spot. If someone on the ship is infected with the demonic power, Border Town must respond immediately." Theo took out a folded letter from his chest, "I need your help to get this letter back to His Highness as quickly as possible."

"Of course," she nodded, "the exchange of information between merchants is always the fastest."

...

Several days of sailing made Lucia feel nauseous.

In the past month, it seemed she had been fleeing non-stop, from the Eastern Region to the King's City and then from the King's City to the Western Region. However, the former was being driven out of her home, while the latter was the last hope in her heart.



"Sister... water, I'm thirsty..."

Ling let out a painful groan, reaching out to grasp her arm.

"Alright, I'll get you some water to drink."

Lucia grabbed the cloth bag beside her and staggered out of the cabin, leaning over the lowest part of the ship's side and dipping the bag into the river. The acid water in her stomach surged up again, and she couldn't help it, eventually throwing up with a retch. The scanty oatmeal in her belly was vomited clean, and acid water flowed from her nostrils. She resisted the urge to cry out loud, clenched her teeth, roughly wiped her face with the back of her hand, and continued to soak the bag. Not until the bag was saturated with water did she hold it in her arms and hastily run back to the cabin.

"Here's the water, open your mouth."

But Ling's complexion was worse than before, with an unnatural blush on her cheeks and her forehead burning hot. She kept her lips tightly closed, making intermittent groaning sounds.

Lucia had no choice but to forcibly pry open her sister's mouth, twist the cloth bag tight, and let the water drip into her sister's mouth.

"Don't get too close to her, the black spots have spread to her neck, and she won't last much longer," a weak middle-aged man in the cabin said, "We're all going to die here, you'd better take care of yourself."

Not long after leaving the capital, people on the ship contracted a terrible disease, starting with a high fever and then black spots appearing on the skin. The disease would rapidly worsen after three or four days, not only rendering the afflicted unconscious but also infecting those who came into contact with them. Therefore, on the fifth day, the fleet specially cleared out a sailboat to transport the sick. Lucia guessed that the reason the refugees who were sick were not all thrown into the river was that their own people had also become infected.



After black spots appeared on Ling's body, she ignored the advice of others and resolutely followed her younger sister to this ship filled with the sick.

To take care of the young Ling, she had hardly closed her eyes in two days.

Lucia still hadn't given up; she believed that everything would get better once they reached the Western Region.

If the rumors were true... the Co-op would be her last hope.
