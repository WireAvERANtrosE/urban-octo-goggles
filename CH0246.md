## New Gunpowder Plan
What symbolizes the industrial age? The first thing that came to Roland's mind was the train, puffing steam and running tirelessly on the rails.

The greasy cast iron cylinders, the robust crankshafts and the massive iron wheels, the rhythmic noise and vibrations, as well as the whistling that cuts through the sky—For Roland, his initial appreciation for the beauty of machinery began with the steam train. Compared to the machines of later generations that hid their structure beneath exteriors, used high precision processing to reduce trembling, and emphasized noise reduction and sound absorption, it undoubtedly presented the power and beauty of industry in a more direct manner.

He also wanted to lay tracks throughout his territory, allowing trains to carry people and goods back and forth across the Western Region. However, while the ideal was appealing, reality was less satisfying—not to mention manufacturing a steam train, just laying the tracks would require a vast amount of steel, far beyond the production capacity of the North Slope's blast furnaces.

Therefore, he settled for the next best thing: a human-powered bicycle. The more flat roads that were built within his territory, the greater the benefits of the bicycle. And compared to the structurally complex steam train, it required almost no maintenance, just a bit of oil for the chain every now and then.

If he planned to mass produce bicycles, naturally he couldn't continue to rely on Anna to handcraft them. So the first thing he needed to do was establish a factory and train a group of professional workers for production and vehicle assembly. Considering that the Kingdom's main road would not be completed until next spring at the earliest, the factory didn't need to be too large to start with. After Anna manufactured the machine tools needed for the assembly line, the workers could slowly get familiar with the process, aiming to produce around a dozen bicycles a month. The highest technical component was the chain, which required the machine to stamp out the chain links, then manually insert the pins to connect them.

However, rubber parts like tires and brakes still relied on Soraya's ability—fortunately, this part of the work wasn't extensive. With the molds prepared, the Magic Pen could quickly produce a large number of them. Bearings were the same—if they couldn't produce reliable rolling bearings, a short segment of a steel sleeve as a sliding bearing worked just as well, and when the inner surface was coated with a smooth mirror finish, it wasn't much worse than the former.

When bicycles first came out, only the nobility could afford such an expensive means of transport. To popularize it among the masses, apart from extensive promotion, Roland also planned to implement an installment payment system to reduce the purchase pressure as much as possible. Of course, only citizens who had obtained an identity card could apply for this payment method from the City Hall.

The three men fiddled in the garden for an entire afternoon. Carter Lannis, worthy of the title of Chief Knight, was the first to master the skill of riding; Iron Axe followed closely behind, the second to successfully make a lap around the garden. Only Barov tried more than ten times without success, either almost falling off unsteadily or unable to go straight. In the end, Roland had to let Soraya draw a static scene of him standing next to the bicycle, hands holding the handlebars.

"Is this all right?" the witch asked after completing the four huge promotional paintings.



"We'll need to add a couple of slogans," Roland pondered for a moment, "On top, write: 'A New Era Mount, owning one feels like this, and so will you.' Below, put: 'The bicycle factory is recruiting workers, offering attractive pay, excellent benefits, and the chance to get your own new bike for free. Applicants must have completed primary education and can sign up at the City Hall.'"

...

After dealing with the bicycle advertisement, the prince returned to his office. With some time left before dinner, he summoned his personal guard to bring over Kyle Sichi.



Now that the development of mercury fulminate had finally made a breakthrough, it was time to schedule the research for a new generation of weapons. Without a doubt, in the era of firearms, caliber represented justice, and rate of fire symbolized freedom; the greater the power, the more glorious, and the more turrets, the more equality... However, an awkward problem was that, at this rate of development, the acids produced through laboratory methods would soon not be able to keep up with the consumption.



For instance, to increase the rate of fire, it was necessary to abandon black powder, which left a lot of residue, and switch to smokeless powder—namely, guncotton, or a mixture of guncotton and nitroglycerin. The same was true for high-powered explosives. It didn't matter if trinitrotoluene (T.N.T.) couldn't be produced; nitrocellulose could be used instead, which, despite its poor stability, was even more powerful than T.N.T.



All of the above substances required a large amount of high-concentration fuming nitric acid, and to purify nitric acid, a large amount of concentrated sulfuric acid was needed. These were not quantities the laboratory could produce. In other words, without an industrial method to produce both acids, even if more efficient weapons were developed, there would be a dilemma of having no ammunition available.



When the Chief Alchemist entered the office, Roland spoke, "I have a new task for you."



"Please tell me," Kyle shrugged, "as long as it's not attending some ceremony."



"I need more acid, and the current production from the chemical laboratory is insufficient to meet my needs. Therefore, your new task is to design a chemical engineering system that can produce both acids efficiently and conveniently."



"Chemical... system?" He looked somewhat puzzled.



"That's right, comprised of one or several complete reaction devices. As long as raw materials are inputted, products can be continuously produced," Roland explained the essence of industrial production simply, "I don't know much about this part myself; you'll have to figure it out on your own."



Although he said this, the prince also knew that this was a very daunting task, likely to take years of research with no guaranteed results. After all, the other party could only rely on some basic reaction principles and chemical equations from "Elementary Chemistry."



"I understand," Kyle nodded. "What you've mentioned is indeed refreshing to hear."



"Whether you can complete it or not, the acids are something I urgently need," Roland paused, "So next month, I plan to build three more laboratories by the Redwater River and recruit qualified candidates from the subjects to serve as laboratory staff. If you do not have time to teach them, select a few disciples to manage them. After all, industrial acid-making is a very lengthy research project."



Perhaps tempted by "Intermediate Chemistry," he agreed immediately, "Yes, Your Highness."



After Kyle Sichi left, Roland sighed lightly.



If the industrial acid-making method didn't show promise, he would have to have Lucia also join the battle to purify the acid solution. After all, when the great war arrived, he would need stronger weapons to secure victory for the town.



Roland opened the drawer, intending to eat some dried fish to relieve his boredom but found the snack drawer completely empty.



Startled, he looked up to see a piece of dried fish already held to his mouth.

"Looking for this?" the blonde woman opposite him smiled.

Roland bit into the dried fish, unable to help but curl the corners of his mouth, "I thought you'd stay in the fog forever."

"That wouldn't be too bad, at least no one can see me, but I can still see you," Nightingale pouted.

His somewhat gloomy mood dissipated unconsciously with the sight of her familiar figure, and he couldn't help but breathe a sigh of relief, "You said before that you didn't know what kind of expression would be appropriate..."

"Hm?"

"Actually, just like this is pretty good."
