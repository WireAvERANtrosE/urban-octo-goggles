## New Gunpowder Plan
What is the symbol of the Industrial Age? The first thing that came to Roland's mind was the train, puffing out billowing steam as it raced incessantly along the rails. 

The greasy cast-iron cylinders, the sturdy crankshafts and the enormous iron wheels, the rhythmic noise and vibration, and the whistle that cut through the sky—all of this marked the beginning of his appreciation for the beauty of machinery. Compared to the machines of later generations that concealed their structure beneath a casing, employed high-precision machining to reduce tremors, and emphasized sound insulation and absorption, the train undoubtedly presented a more direct manifestation of the power and beauty of industry. 

He, too, wished to lay tracks throughout his territory, allowing trains to drag carriages of people and goods back and forth across the Western Region. However, while the ideal was enticing, reality was less accommodating—not to mention manufacturing a steam train, the sheer amount of steel needed to lay the tracks far exceeded the iron ingot capacity of the North Slope mine's blast furnaces.

Therefore, settling for the next best thing, the bicycle powered by human effort became Roland's optimal choice. The more flat roads that were built within his territory, the greater the benefits of the bicycle. Moreover, compared to the structurally complex steam train, it required virtually no maintenance, with only the occasional need to oil the chain.

If he intended to mass-produce bicycles, he naturally could not continue to rely on Anna's handcrafting. Therefore, he first needed to establish a factory and train a group of specialized workers for production and vehicle assembly. Considering that the Kingdom Main Street would not be completed until next spring at the earliest, the factory could start on a small scale. After Anna had manufactured the necessary machine tools for the assembly line, the workers could gradually familiarize themselves with the workflow, aiming to produce about a dozen bicycles a month. The most technically demanding component was the chain, which required machines to stamp out chain links and then manually insert pins to connect them into shape.

However, rubber parts like tires and brakes still had to rely on Soraya's ability to make them—fortunately, this part of the work was not extensive. With the molds prepared, the Magic Pen could quickly draw out a large number of them. The same was true for bearings. If they could not make reliable rolling bearings, taking a short section of steel sleeve as a sliding bearing would also work. After coating the inner ring with a smooth mirror finish, the effect was not much worse than the former.

When bicycles first came into the world, only the nobility could afford such an expensive mode of transportation. To popularize them among the masses, aside from extensive promotion, Roland also planned to implement an installment payment system to reduce the purchasing pressure as much as possible. Of course, only citizens who had obtained an identity card could apply for this payment method at the Town Hall.

The three of them toiled in the garden for an afternoon. Carter Lannis, true to his name as the Chief Knight, was the first to master cycling skills; Iron Axe followed closely behind, becoming the second to successfully circle the garden. Barov, on the other hand, tried more than a dozen times without success, either almost falling off because of his wobbly ride or unable to proceed in a straight line. In the end, Roland had no choice but to have Soraya draw a static scene of him standing next to the bicycle with both hands on the handlebars.

"Is this all right?" the witch asked after completing the four huge promotional paintings.



"Two more lines of advertising copy need to be added," Roland pondered for a moment, "On top write: 'New Era Mounts, having one feels like this for me, and it will be the same for you.' Below that write: 'The bicycle factory is recruiting workers, with considerable pay, generous benefits, and the chance to get a free bicycle of your own. Those who have completed primary education can sign up at the City Hall.'"



...



After dealing with the bicycle promotional poster, the prince returned to his office. With some time before dinner, he had his guards summon Kyle Sichi.



Now that the development of mercury fulminate had finally made a breakthrough, it was time to schedule the development of the next generation of weapons. Without a doubt, in the era of firearms, caliber represented justice, while rate of fire represented freedom; the greater the power, the more glorious, and the more turrets, the more equal... However, an embarrassing problem was that if development continued in this way, the two acids obtained by laboratory methods would soon fall short of the consumption rate.



For instance, to increase the rate of fire, one would have to abandon the residue-laden black powder and switch to smokeless powder—that is, guncotton or a mixture of guncotton with nitroglycerin. The same goes for high-power explosives; it's okay if trinitrotoluene (T.N.T.) can't be produced, as nitrocellulose can be used instead. Despite its poor stability, its power is even greater than T.N.T.



No matter which of the above substances, they all require a large amount of high-concentration nitric acid, and the purification of nitric acid requires a large amount of concentrated sulfuric acid—quantities that are not achievable by the laboratory's production. In other words, without the ability to industrially produce the two acids, even if more efficient weapons were developed, one would fall into the dilemma of having no ammunition available.



When the Chief Alchemist walked into the office, Roland spoke, "I have a new task for you."



"Please tell me," Kyle shrugged, "as long as it's not attending any ceremonies."



"I need more acid, the current production from the chemical laboratory is no longer sufficient for my needs, so your new task is to design a chemical engineering system that can efficiently and conveniently produce both acids."



"Chemical... industry system?" He looked somewhat puzzled.



"That's right, it consists of one or several complete reaction devices. As long as raw materials are inputted, products can be produced continuously," Roland explained the essence of industrial production simply, "I don’t know much about this part either, you'll have to figure it out on your own."



Even though he said this, the prince also knew it was a very daunting task that could take years of research to bear fruit, and it was still uncertain whether there would be any results at all. After all, the other party could only rely on some basic reaction principles and chemical equations from "Elementary Chemistry."



"I understand," Kyle nodded, "The things you've mentioned do indeed give me a fresh perspective."



"Whether you can complete it or not, I urgently need both acids," Roland paused, "Therefore, next month I plan to expand and build three more laboratories by the Redwater River and recruit qualified individuals from the subjects to serve as laboratory technicians. If you don't have time to teach them, select a few disciples to manage them. After all, the industrial method of making acid is a very long-term research project."



Perhaps tempted by the "Intermediate Chemistry," he agreed immediately, "Yes, Your Highness."



After Kyle Sichi left, Roland let out a light sigh.



If industrial acid-making showed no hope, he would have to have Lucia join the battle to purify the acid, as when the great war came, he would need stronger weapons to win victory for the town.



Roland pulled open the drawer, intending to eat some dried fish to relieve his boredom, but found the snack drawer completely empty.



Startled, he lifted his head, only to see a piece of dried fish already extended to his mouth.

"Are you looking for this?" the blonde woman opposite him smiled.

Roland bit into the dried fish, unable to resist curling up the corners of his mouth, "I thought you would just stay in the fog forever."

"That wouldn't be too bad either, at least no one else can see me, but I can still see you," Nightingale pursed her lips.

The somewhat gloomy mood unconsciously dissipated quite a bit. Seeing the familiar look on her face, he couldn't help but breathe a sigh of relief, "You said before, you didn't know what kind of expression to wear..."

"Hmm?"

"Actually, just like this is quite nice."
