## God's Punishment Stone
Roland quickly estimated the volume of the underground cave—it was about the size of a football field at the bottom, with steep mountain walls surrounding it. The branch that led to this place was right in the middle of one of the walls, and next to the entrance was a narrow stone staircase that extended downwards.



"I guess this staircase wasn't carved out by you guys," he crouched down, bringing the torch close to the ground. Under the firelight, the marks of axe and knife cuts on the steps were very obvious, and there were plenty of stone chips and dust accumulated in the grooves.



"Of course not, Your Highness, the steps were already here when we found this place," Carter shrugged his shoulders, "I guess this thing has been in existence for decades."



"Or centuries," Anna suddenly said.



"I think so too," Lightning nodded, "Border Town has only been established for seventy years, the staircase is unlikely to be related to the locals or the kingdom."



"Were there people in the Western Territory centuries ago?" Carter questioned, "Greycastle wasn't even established then, right?"



Roland patted the knight's shoulder, "Four hundred and fifty years ago, there were a group of people forgotten by history." Then he lifted the torch, "Let's go, let's take a look below."



The First Army soldiers had already surrounded the bottom of the cave in twos and threes. He walked straight to the side of the God's Stone of Retribution with the knight and the witches, and only by standing at the foot of the stone pillar could one truly feel the enormity of the God's Stone. With arms outstretched, they were less than one-tenth of its width, and one had to tilt their head back to barely see its top. The tallest purple God's Stone of Retribution was nearly thirty meters high, almost equivalent to an eight or nine-story building.



Theoretically, a stone that glows on its own either contains radioactive material or fluorescent components, but the glow of the God's Stone of Retribution was clearly unrelated to either of these—the former's glow comes from the air ionization phenomenon caused by the decay of the element itself, and the shorter the half-life, the brighter the light. Judging by this brightness, the soldiers who entered first wouldn't last a few minutes before all dying from ionizing radiation. The latter, on the other hand, requires light exposure to glow, and there is no light source deep underground, obviously unable to support it continuously emitting cold light.



Roland also noticed that although the God's Stone was in the common shape of a prism, its surface lacked the crystalline lines and was as smooth as a flat pane of glass.



"A God's Punishment Stone the size of a thumb could sell for several Gold Royals in the church. One as big as this... could practically empty the treasuries of the four major kingdoms," Carter couldn't help but sigh.



"Selling it to nobles to harm witches?" Nightingale glared at him.



"Uh, I didn't say that," the Chief Knight unconsciously shifted his gaze away.



"I've never seen a God's Punishment Stone of this color before; shouldn't it be white and transparent?" Lightning curiously examined the stone pillar. "If I take a piece back, does that mean I won't need to light candles at night?"



"I'd rather light a dozen candles in a stuffy room than use it for lighting," Nightingale crossed her arms, "For witches, it's a cage, shackles, an accomplice of the Church! If only this damn stone didn't exist in the world."



"Hmm, Sister Nightingale, you don't read at night anyway..." The young girl licked her lips, picked up a stone, and looked towards Roland, "Can I take a piece back as a trophy from my adventure?"



Roland nodded, "If you don't mind such a thing."



She swung the stone in her hand and struck it hard against the corner of the prism. There was only a "ding" of a crisp sound, the stone shattered in response, but not even a scratch was left on the prism.



The knight couldn't help but exclaim, "What's going on... aren't God's Punishment Stones supposed to be brittle and easily broken?"



"Maybe this glowing one is different." Lightning brushed off the stone chips from her hand and took a dagger from her waist pouch. She fiddled with the prism for a while, but even after scraping, cutting, and picking, it was all in vain.



Roland sensed something was amiss and signaled to Nightingale, "You try."



She nodded, drew her revolver, and directly pulled the trigger at another prism. A huge roar echoed in the bottom of the cave, and sparks emerged from the part of the God's Punishment Stone that was hit. After the gunsmoke had cleared, the group walked over and saw that the bullet had only left a shallow mark on the surface of the stone.



This meant that, in terms of strength, it had already surpassed that of homogeneous steel plates.



"Even firearms are useless?" Carter frowned, "How did the Church manage to cut and polish it for sale?"



Nobody could answer this question, and it also did not match everyone's usual understanding.



At least Roland had once shattered a God's Punishment Lock with a brick—like the one that was bound around Anna's neck, which took only two or three hits to turn the sparkling and translucent stone into a pile of white powder.



Anna, who had been silent, suddenly spoke up, "Your Highness, do you still remember the 'treasure map' drawn by Philip · Silt of Dawn Light?"



"Treasure map?" Roland was stunned for a moment. He vaguely remembered that the blueprint had a triangle occupying most of the area, with its three vertices respectively pointing towards the Holy City of Taquila, the Hidden Forest stone tower, and the foot of the northern slope... Wait, the foot of the northern slope? A bolt of lightning suddenly struck through his mind, "Could it be..."



"I think that point doesn't refer to the North Slope Mine, but here—" Anna said slowly, "This underground cave that contains a large amount of God's Punishment Stones."



...



After a thorough search, apart from the piles of indestructible God's Stones, no other valuable discovery was found in the cave.

Not to mention ancient books or remains, not even the tools used to carve the stone stairs were left behind, which was quite baffling. With the current level of technology, carving a staircase on the steep stone walls was definitely a huge and arduous task. Incidents such as accidental falls or lost tools should have been common. But the scene was devoid of anything but stones, as if they had completely cleaned the cave before evacuating.



After returning to his office, Roland summoned the scrolls and reproduced the Knight of Dawn's blueprint on the "Book of Magic."



As he remembered, the southernmost point indeed fell at the location of the foot of the North Slope.

If Anna's guess was correct, could this be a map left by the church while searching for new veins of God's Punishment Stones? But why would they abandon everything after spending a great deal of effort to carve out a staircase leading directly to the bottom of the cave? If the church had established a border church here 450 years ago, today's Border Town would likely be completely different—considering the selling price and uses of God's Punishment Stones, this mine does not seem like a resource to be easily discarded.



Now that the Holy City of Taquila has become an unreachable forbidden area, perhaps these answers can only be known after heading to the stone tower... or perhaps they will never be known.
