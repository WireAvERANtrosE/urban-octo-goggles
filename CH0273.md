## God's Punishment Stone
Roland quickly estimated the volume of the underground cave; the bottom was roughly the size of a football field, surrounded by steep cliffs. The branch that led to this place was right in the middle of the cliff face, with a narrow staircase beside the entrance that extended downwards.



"I guess this staircase wasn't carved by you guys," he crouched down, bringing the torch close to the ground. Under the light of the fire, the marks of axes and chisels on the stone steps were very clear, with plenty of stone chips and dust accumulated within the carvings.



"Of course not, Your Highness, the steps were already here when we found this place," Carter shrugged, "I guess they've been here for decades."



"Or centuries," Anna suddenly spoke.



"I think so too," Lightning nodded, "Border Town has only been established for seventy years, it's unlikely that the staircase has anything to do with the locals or the kingdom."



"Were there people in the Western Region centuries ago?" Carter questioned, "Greycastle wasn't even established then."



Roland patted the knight's shoulder, "Four hundred and fifty years ago, there was a group of people forgotten by history." Then he lifted the torch, "Let's go down and take a look."



The First Army soldiers had already formed a perimeter at the bottom of the cave, and he walked straight to the Divine Stone of Judgement with the knight and witches. Only when standing at the foot of the stone pillar could one truly feel the enormity of the God's Stone. Stretching out his arms, they would not even reach a tenth of its width, and one had to tilt their head back to barely see its top. The tallest purple Divine Stone of Judgement was almost thirty meters high, nearly equivalent to an eight- or nine-story building.



Theoretically, a stone that could glow on its own either contained radioactive material or fluorescent components, but the light from the Divine Stone of Judgement was clearly unrelated to either—the former's glow comes from the ionization of air due to the decay of the elements themselves, and the brighter the light, the shorter the half-life. By this measure of brightness, the soldiers who entered first wouldn't last more than a few minutes before all dying from ionizing radiation. The latter requires light exposure to glow, and with no light source deep underground, it obviously couldn't support the continuous emission of its cold light.



Roland also noticed that although the God's Stone was in the common prismatic shape of crystals, its surface lacked the crystalline patterns and was as smooth as a flat piece of glass.



"A thumb-sized Divine Stone of Judgement in the church could sell for several Gold Royals," Carter couldn't help but sigh. "A piece this big... it could practically empty the treasuries of the four major kingdoms."



"Sell it to nobles to harm witches?" Nightingale glared at him fiercely.



"Uh, I didn't say that," the Chief Knight unconsciously averted his gaze.



"This is my first time seeing a Divine Stone of Judgement of this color; shouldn't it be white and transparent?" Lightning curiously examined the stone pillar. "If I take a piece back, would I not need to light candles at night?"



"I'd rather light a dozen candles in a stuffy room than use it for light," Nightingale crossed her arms and said, "To witches, it is a cage, a shackle, an accomplice of the church! If only this damn stone didn't exist in the world."



"Um, Sister Nightingale, you don't read books at night anyway..." The little girl licked her lips, picked up a stone, and looked towards Roland, "Can I take a piece back as a trophy from my adventure?"



Roland nodded, "If you don't mind such a thing."



She swung the stone in her hand and struck it hard against the corner of the pillar, only to hear a crisp "ding" sound. The stone shattered in response, yet not a single mark was left on the pillar.



The knight couldn't help but exclaim, "What's going on... Aren't Divine Stones of Judgement supposed to be fragile and brittle?"



"Perhaps this glowing one is different," Lightning brushed off the stone dust from her hands, then took a dagger from her waist pouch and fiddled around the prism for a while. Despite scraping, cutting, and picking, her efforts were ultimately in vain.



Roland sensed something was off and signaled to Nightingale, "You try."



Nodding, she pulled out her revolver and fired directly at another prism. A loud boom echoed in the cave, and sparks flew from the point where the Divine Stone of Judgement was hit. After the smoke cleared, the group walked over and saw that the bullet had only left a shallow mark on the surface of the stone.



This meant that in terms of strength, it had already surpassed that of homogeneous steel plates.



"Even firearms are useless?" Carter frowned, "Then how did the Church manage to cut and polish it for sale?"



No one could answer that question, and it also contradicted everyone's usual impression.



At least Roland had once shattered the Chains of Divine Punishment with a brick—like the one that had been bound around Anna's neck, which took only two or three hits to turn the crystal-clear stone into a pile of white powder.



Anna, who had been silent until now, suddenly spoke up, "Your Highness, do you remember the 'treasure map' drawn by Morning Light Filin Silt?"



"Treasure map?" Roland was startled for a moment. He vaguely remembered that a triangle occupied most of the area on the blueprint, with its three vertices pointing towards the Holy City of Taquila, the stone tower in the Misty Forest, and the foot of the North Slope mountain... Wait, the foot of the North Slope mountain? A bolt of lightning suddenly flashed through his mind. "Could it be..."



"I think that point is not indicating the North Slope Mine, but here—" Anna said slowly, "This underground cave that contains a large amount of Divine Stone of Judgement."



...



After a thorough search, besides the piles of indestructible Divine Stones, no other valuable discoveries were found in the cave.

Not to mention ancient books or remains, even the tools used to chisel the stone stairs were not left behind, which was quite puzzling. With the current level of technology, carving a staircase out of the steep rock walls was definitely a massive and daunting task. Incidents such as accidental falls and lost tools should have been common. But the scene was devoid of anything but stones, as if they had completely cleaned out the cave before leaving.



Roland, after returning to his office, summoned the scrolls and reproduced the Dawn Knight's blueprint on the "Book of Magic Projection."

The pattern, similar to his memory, indeed placed the southernmost point at the foot of the North Slope mountain.

If Anna's guess was correct, could this map be one left by the Church while they were searching for new veins of Divine Stone of Judgement? But why would they abandon everything after going to the trouble of excavating a staircase that led straight to the bottom of the cave? If the Church had established a border church here four hundred and fifty years ago, today's Border Town would likely be completely different—considering the selling price and uses of the Divine Stone of Judgement, this mine doesn't seem like a resource that could be easily discarded.



Now that the Holy City of Taquila has become an unreachable forbidden zone, perhaps these answers can only be known after heading to the stone tower... or perhaps they will never be known.
