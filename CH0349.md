## Legacy (Part 1)
Maine stood atop the spire of the Tower of Babel, looking out the window towards the snow-covered city of Hermes. 

Ever since the last massive attack of demonic beasts on the New Holy City, the ice plains had temporarily calmed down, and the snow had also lessened significantly, giving the city's residents a rare leisure. 

These days should have been worth celebrating, but Maine still felt an emptiness within. In order to kill those terrifying giant hybrid demonic beasts, a team of God's Punishment Army warriors had rushed out of the city walls from a side gate to confront them head-on. In the end, nineteen were injured, and two died. The two giant beasts had their limbs severed and were still roaring on the ground for a long time, until the guards on the city walls killed them with javelins. However, more than the losses of the God's Punishment Army, what truly filled him with fear was the time point that the demonic beasts represented. 

After a long silence, he let out a long sigh, sat back at the table, and wanted to open the Holy Book and read it over again. 

"No matter how many times you flip through it, the result won't change," Tefren just happened to walk into the circular hall with two cups of hot drink, pushing one of the cups in front of Maine, "Has His Majesty Oberon not agreed to see you?"

"I have submitted my request to the Secretariat for the third time, but there still has been no response," Maine said anxiously, "I don't know what His Majesty is busy with at such a critical moment—"

"Don't worry," Tefren interrupted him, "You yourself have said that the Holy Book was written by the first Pope, and it's inevitable that there are errors. After more than four hundred years, who can guarantee that everything is correct?"

"However, this is different," the Archbishop shook his head, "If we have miscalculated the time, it will be a catastrophe for us! Now we have invested a lot of effort and resources to unify the kingdom, in order to gather the strength of the whole continent to fight the devils, but if the time is halved, we simply won't be able to accumulate so many God's Punishment Army troops after the war!"

"Quiet, Lord Maine," the old bishop smiled and slowly sipped his hot drink, "What's done is done, the hell fangs have appeared before us, and no one can change that. But there may be two reasons for this."



"What's the reason?"

"Take a sip first, then I'll tell you," he said, stroking his beard.

Mayne picked up the cup, which looked like a cup of sheep's milk. As he got closer, a spicy fragrance hit his nose, "What did you put in it?"

"Winterflower," Tefren curled up the corners of his mouth, "Although you can't directly drink Dream Water, a bit of this is still good. It can at least help you relieve tension and also has a calming and sleep-inducing effect."

Mayne downed the sheep's milk in one gulp, feeling a burning sensation in his throat. Although the richness of the sheep's milk diluted the bite of the Winterflower juice, it was still somewhat difficult for him to adapt to, as he did not often drink such concoctions. After coughing twice, he wiped his mouth, "Even a cup of Dream Water wouldn't make me fall asleep at this moment. Can you tell me now?"

"One possibility is that the Pope made a mistake. For an old man, it's common to experience dizzy spells and memory errors; I can deeply relate to that," Tefren shrugged.

"Unlikely," Mayne frowned, "This involves the church's layout and arrangements, even determining the fate of humanity. He must have written these contents with the utmost caution. What's the second point?"

"The second scenario is that, due to some unknown circumstances, everything has changed."

The archbishop waited for a moment, and seeing that the other party had no intention of continuing, he asked in surprise, "Is that it?"



"Just like that," he repeated.



"This... what kind of joke is this, everything has changed? Just for this reason, all our efforts will be in vain! How can you speak so lightly—"



"Lord Mayne!" Tavren’s voice suddenly rose a few degrees, "What exactly are you insisting on, a path that is guaranteed to defeat the devils? Or do you think that only you wish to protect Hermes and keep the devils' footsteps beyond the ice field?"



"…" Mayne was stunned.



"In every battle, everyone hopes to win, but so far, even against the four major kingdoms, we have not won every battle, let alone against the devils from hell?" he said loudly, "Have you forgotten the teachings of His Holiness the Pope? Excessive insistence and fear of the outcome are not much different. What you should do is accept the facts and then take it step by step to the end—As for the outcome, it is not something we can control."



Fear… the outcome. Mayne was shaken; he was right, he was indeed afraid, afraid that after becoming the Pope, he would not be able to stop the devils, and ultimately humanity would be buried by his own hands.



"I used to be like you," Tavren's voice suddenly lowered, "but the death of Hesier made me realize that the outcome is often unpredictable. The Evil Months came without warning, but we still took Wolfheart before the heavy snowfall, just as planned... but Hesier still died, and the manner of warfare has changed. Even so, we must continue to move forward," he stood up, let out a breath, patted Mayne's shoulder, and walked towards the hall exit, "So... whether it's five years or ten, you have to steadfastly walk to the end, not for that guaranteed path to victory, but to fulfill your duty, even if the outcome is against your wishes."



The hall door closed, and Mayne stared at the empty cup in front of him, unable to speak for a long while.



He had to admit the other party made sense, but how could he not feel afraid when he truly had to shoulder that responsibility?



Suddenly, a chief justice walked in, "Lord Mayne, His Holiness the Pope wishes to see you."

At last!

He immediately stood up, eager, "Quick, take me to the Holy See."

...

Hidden deep beneath the plateau, the Holy See remained cold and silent.

Entering the main hall of the Holy See, Mayne was slightly taken aback. There was no Transcendence Ceremony scheduled for today, yet all the candles were lit, their dense flickering flames outlining the hall in a glowing orange contour. The chandeliers above were like a congregation of stars in the divine realm.

His Excellency, Archbishop O'Brien, was seated on the throne, quietly watching him.

Mayne felt an unsettling atmosphere and suppressed the doubts in his heart. He walked to the front of the seat, knelt down with both hands on the ground, and touched his forehead to the floor.

"Rise, my child," the Pope's voice was very soft, difficult to hear clearly without concentrating.



Main straightened up and saw that the other's face was filled with uncontrollable aging and fatigue, as if he hadn't rested for a long time. "Your Highness, please take care of your health."



"No need," he smiled, and deep wrinkles suddenly covered his cheeks, "I am about to die."



"Your Highness, you will not—"



"No, listen to me, child," O'Brien interrupted the bishop with difficulty, "I am aware of the condition of my body, without a doubt, my time is coming." He paused for a moment and took a deep breath, "The reason I called you here today is to pass on the position of the Pope to you."
