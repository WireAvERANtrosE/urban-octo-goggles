## Roland Winters, more commonly known as "Roland," is the reborn main character and the 4th Prince of the Kingdom of Graycastle. In the unofficial English fan translations of "Release that Witch," the name "雷鸣" is translated as "Thunder."
The massive stronghold coalition forces marched slowly on the road to Border Town.

At the very front of the team was the knight order composed of the six great families of the stronghold. The differences in the strength of each knight's family were evident from their armor and attire. Undoubtedly, the most eye-catching were the knights under the Duke of Lion, whose mounts were short-tailed horses from the royal capital, adept at long-distance running and a size larger than other horses. The knights sitting on horseback appeared even more majestic; their armor was uniformly forged by the stronghold's "Hammer and Dragon Fang" blacksmith shop, with shiny, thick chest plates engraved with a large lion's head, and shoulder guards featuring two wolf heads as if roaring. Their cloaks were embroidered with exquisite patterns, and red silk ribbons were tied around their waists.

These knights were by no means just for show. After the Evil Months ended each year, they were responsible for venturing out of the city to eliminate the remaining evil beasts, ensuring that the land routes were clear. Each one of them had accumulated a wealth of combat experience. In terms of individual combat, they were not much inferior to the knights of the royal capital, but they were just a little short in numbers—of course, for the Duke of Lion to amass an elite cavalry troop of one hundred and fifty men, that was already a remarkably lavish expenditure.

the Duke of Lion looked at this sharp division with satisfaction; without a doubt, with their strength, there was no one in the West who could stop him.

The mercenaries were walking in the middle of the procession, and their equipment was considerably less impressive in comparison. Most of them wore somewhat outdated chainmail or lamellar armor, either lacking gauntlets or helmets. A portion of them only had cheap leather armor, and their weapons varied. They spread out along the road, grouping in twos and threes, walking and talking loudly, as if this journey was not for battle but merely a spring outing.

Lining up at the end of the queue were the freemen conscripted by the various lords, dragging carts loaded with food and tents, and following slowly behind the mercenaries. The difference in marching speed caused this force of about fifteen hundred people to stretch out very long, with the knight units at the front occasionally stopping to wait for the people behind to catch up.

"My lord," Count Elk Hillte Mead pulled the reins to keep pace with the duke, "We are less than half a day's journey from Border Town. If all goes well, we should arrive around the Hour of the Dog (4 p.m.). When we get there, will the troops rest for the night and act the next morning, or will we immediately launch an attack on the lord's castle?"

"Do you want to spend a night in the wilderness?" the duke laughed. "At night, I think we should be lying in the castle's big beds, not in the damp mud. Of course, we must still consider the royal family's face. After arriving at Border Town, I will first send an envoy to persuade him to surrender."

Count Honeysuckle, who was walking slightly ahead, turned back, "The knights have been marching all day; both men and horses are exhausted. Wouldn't it be inappropriate to attack directly? After all, Roland Wimbledon managed to get through the entire Evil Months safely with those miners of his. I think it's better to be cautious."



"Ha ha, it's fine if others are unclear, but even you don't know the details of the demonic beasts, my old friend? They are indeed terrifying in the wild, swift in action, and their strength is astonishing, but with a city wall, most demonic beasts are just targets. In the end, they are nothing but a pack of wild animals," Count Elk shrugged. "I am surprised that he could build a city wall so quickly, but just with this, it's not possible to withstand my knights, right? They are not brainless fools."



"That's right. Moreover, I have received a piece of news from the north," the Duke of Lion said casually, "This year, Hermes suffered a large-scale attack by mixed demonic beasts, and the New Holy City almost fell. The reason is still unclear, but it seems that this year's demonic beasts were all targeting the Holy City, and the Western Territory only had a few that slipped through the net."



As the lord of the Western Territory, his attention was not only focused on this remote area. He had informants placed in major towns for many years, continuously sending him the latest intelligence from all over. The tragic battle in the north was not the focus. A few days ago, he received a secret report sent from Cliff Ridge City, stating that a fierce battle had erupted in Eagle City between the new King Timothy and Queen of Clearwater, Grace, in the Southern Territory—according to previous reports, Timothy's troops should have arrived at Eagle City only a month later.



The letter did not mention the course of the battle, only that when Timothy returned from Cliff Ridge City, the thousands of troops he had were almost gone, and he was even unable to block the roads as he had when he arrived. Some people also saw Eagle City ablaze with towering flames, with black smoke columns rising almost level with the clouds, witnessed by residents of the surrounding towns.



Without a doubt, regardless of whether Queen of Clearwater died at Timothy's hands, such a devastating loss was a severe blow to the new king. This secret letter made the Duke of Lion restless, and he sent multiple trusted people overnight to the capital and the Eastern Territory, hoping to find out Timothy's current situation. If there was an opportunity to destroy the new king's not-yet-stable regime in the battle between the two kings, he certainly would not mind adding another torch to the fire.



If he wanted to declare himself king independently, now was almost the best opportunity. The soldiers of the north were buried at the foot of the Holy City, and the south had just experienced a great battle and clearly needed to lie down and lick its wounds. The Eastern Territory and the capital were not even worth mentioning, as they probably would not recover for years. As long as he could pull together a group of people to consume the north, he could tear Greycastle into two halves. By then, the territory and population he would have would be comparable to the Northernmost Kingdom of Everwinter, and his power would be completely capable of competing with Greycastle in the southeast.



And he, Osmond Ryan, would be the first king of this land.



Thinking of this, the Duke showed a smug smile, hoping to end this farce today and immediately take the prince on the return journey tomorrow. With luck, he would receive good news from his trusted informants in his castle in three days.



As the sun gradually sloped westward, nearing the mountain peaks, the Duke of Lion saw the silhouette of Border Town's castle... and beyond the town, a densely packed array of figures.



"Father, Your Grace," Rene Mead, who was responsible for leading the way at the front of the team, hurried back to report, "The people ahead are likely the guards of the Fourth Prince. They are all armed, and it doesn't look like they're welcoming us."

"That's just as well; at least we don't have to bother going to the castle to invite him," Count Elk laughed. "Inform the knights to slow down; we're still far from charging distance."

"Yes, Father." Rene took his leave.

the Duke of Lion raised his telescope to observe the opposing formation. The team in the mirror seemed very strange; they were holding a peculiar weapon, standing shoulder to shoulder in two dense rows. If one were to say that the weapon was a spear, there was no spear tip to be seen, and the handle was too short. Moreover, the formation they had set up was too illogical... Such a thin line of defense, wouldn't it break upon impact?

This puzzled the Duke. Even if the Prince lacked knowledge in military formations, he still had knights and guards at his disposal; it was unlikely they would all indulge his folly. After a moment of thought, the Duke decided to let the mercenaries lead the assault while the knight troops temporarily remained on standby in the charging acceleration zone, to see what the Prince was really up to.

Of course, an envoy to persuade surrender still had to be sent. the Duke of Lion summoned a personal guard, "Go tell the Prince that I have no intention of harming him. It's just that King Timothy Wimbledon's decree has arrived, and I must comply. If he lays down his weapons and surrenders now, he will not suffer any harm, and I will escort him back to the royal capital with the treatment due to a prince."

Assembling a large army is a very slow process; the knights gradually took their positions, while the mercenaries were still sluggishly gathering in front of the formation. At this moment, the Duke of Lion saw four flashes of light appear on the enemy's position—light that vanished as quickly as it appeared, replaced by rising puffs of blue smoke. He frowned, thinking he had seen wrong, and just as he was about to take a closer look through his telescope, a series of thunderous explosions suddenly erupted beside his ear!
