## Thunder
The grand allied army of the fortress slowly marched towards Border Town.
At the very front of the team was the Knights Order formed by the six major families of the fortress. From the armor and attire of the knights from each family, the disparity in the strength of their respective families could be discerned. Undoubtedly, the most eye-catching were the knights under Duke Ryan, whose mounts were short-tailed horses from the capital, adept at long-distance running and a size larger than the other horses. The knights sitting atop their steeds appeared even more majestic; their armor was uniformly crafted by the fortress's "Hammer and Dragon Fang" blacksmiths, with a bright silver, thick chest plate engraved with a huge lion's head, and shoulder guards with two wolf heads as if they were roaring. A cloak with exquisite patterns draped their backs, and a red silk ribbon was tied around their waists.
These knights were not just for show. After the end of the Evil Months, they were responsible for venturing out of the city to clear out the remaining demonic beasts, ensuring the land routes remained open. Each one had accumulated considerable combat experience, and in terms of one-on-one combat, they were not much inferior to the knights of the capital's Knights Order, except in number—of course, for the Duke to gather an elite cavalry troop of one hundred and fifty men was already a staggering expense.
Duke Ryan looked at this sharp and elite force with satisfaction. Without a doubt, with their strength, no one in the Western Region could stand in his way.
Walking in the middle of the procession was the mercenary troop, whose equipment was somewhat inferior compared to the knights. Most of them wore somewhat outdated chainmail or lamellar armor, either missing gauntlets or without helmets. Others were only equipped with cheap leather armor, and their weapons were of all sorts. They were spread out along the road, grouped in twos and threes, walking while talking and laughing loudly, as if this journey was not for battle but merely a spring outing.
At the end of the line were the freemen, who had been conscripted by the various lords. They dragged carts loaded with food and tents, trudging behind the mercenaries. The difference in marching speed caused this force of about fifteen hundred people to stretch out very long, with the knights at the front occasionally stopping to wait for the rear troops to catch up.
"My lord," Count Elk, Hill Mead, pulled the reins, aligning himself with the Duke, "We are still half a day's journey from Border Town. If all goes well, we should arrive by the Hour of the Dog (4 pm). Will the troops rest for the night and move out the next morning, or will we launch an immediate attack on the lord's castle?"
"Do you really want to sleep out in the wild?" the Duke laughed, "I think we should be lying in the castle's big beds at night, not in the damp mud. Of course, we still have to consider the royal family's dignity. After arriving at Border Town, I will first send out envoys to persuade him to surrender."
Earl Honeysuckle, who was walking slightly ahead, turned his head back, "The knights have been marching all day, and both men and horses are exhausted. Wouldn't it be improper to attack directly? After all, Roland Wimbledon has safely made it through the entire Evil Months with those miners of his. I think it's better to be cautious."

"Haha, it's fine if others don't understand, but even you don't know the ins and outs of demonic beasts, my old friend? They are indeed terrifying in the wild, swift in movement, and their strength is astonishing. But with a city wall, most demonic beasts are just targets. After all, they are just a bunch of wild animals," Count Elk shrugged. "I am surprised that he managed to build a wall so quickly, but just with that, it's impossible to withstand my knights, right? They are not brainless fools."

"That's true. And I have also received news from the North," Duke Ryan said casually, "This year, Hermes has been attacked by a large number of mixed demonic beasts, and the New Holy City was almost lost. The reason is still unclear, but it seems that this year's demonic beasts were all targeting the Holy City, and the ones in the Western Territory are just a few that slipped through the net."

As the master of the Western Territory, his gaze was not only focused on this remote place. He had eyes in every major town that had been in place for years, constantly feeding him the latest intelligence from all over. The brutal battle in the North was not the focus; a few days ago, he received a secret report sent from Cliff Ridge. The new King Timothy and Queen Grace of Clearwater had erupted into fierce battle in Eagle City of the Southern Territory—according to previous intelligence, Timothy's army should have arrived at Eagle City a month later.

The letter did not detail the course of the battle, but it mentioned that when Timothy returned to Cliff Ridge, his army of thousands was reduced to a mere handful. He was even unable to block the roads as he had on his way there. Also, people saw Eagle City engulfed in a blaze, with black smoke columns rising almost level with the clouds, a spectacle witnessed by residents of surrounding towns.

Without a doubt, regardless of whether Queen Grace perished at Timothy's hands, such a heavy loss was a serious blow to the new King. The secret letter made Duke Ryan eager to act, sending multiple trusted envoys overnight to the capital and the Eastern Territory, hoping to get a clear picture of Timothy's current situation. If there was a chance to destroy the new king's still-unstable regime in this war between two kings, he would not mind adding another torch to the fire.

If he wanted to declare himself king, now was almost the best opportunity. The soldiers of the North were buried at the foot of the Holy City, the South had just experienced a great battle and clearly needed to lie down and lick its wounds, and as for the Eastern Territory and the capital, they probably wouldn't recover for years. As long as he could pull a group to devour the North, he could tear Greycastle in two. By then, the territory and population he owned would be comparable to the Kingdom of Everwinter in the far North, and his strength would be enough to contend with the southeastern regions of Greycastle.

And he, Osmond Ryan, would be the first king of this land.

Thinking of this, the Duke revealed a smug smile, hoping to end this farce today and immediately escort the prince on the return journey tomorrow. With luck, he would be welcoming good news from his trusted envoys in his castle in three days.

As the sun gradually moved westward, nearing the mountain tops, Ryan saw the faint outline of the Border Town castle... and outside the town, a dense array of figures.

"Father, Your Grace," Rayne Mead, who was leading the way for the team, rushed back to report, "Those men ahead should be the guards of the Fourth Prince. They are all armed and do not seem to welcome us."
"That's just as well; at least we don't have to bother inviting him from the castle," the Earl of Elk laughed. "Inform the knights to slow down; we are still far from charging distance."
"Yes, Father." Rayne took his leave.
Duke Ryan raised his telescope to observe the formation of the opposing side. The troops in the mirror looked very strange, holding a peculiar weapon and standing shoulder to shoulder in two dense rows. If one were to say the weapon was a spear, there was no spearhead to be seen, and the handle was too short. Moreover, the array they had formed was too illogical... Such a thin defense line, would it not break upon a single charge?
This puzzled the Duke. Even if the Prince lacked military formation knowledge, he still had knights and guardsmen at his disposal; it was impossible for them all to indulge in such folly. After pondering for a moment, the Duke decided to let the mercenaries lead the charge, with the knight troops temporarily stationed in the charge acceleration zone on standby to see what the Prince was planning.
Of course, an envoy to negotiate surrender still had to be sent. Duke Ryan called over a guard, "Tell the Prince that I have no intention of harming him. It's just that King Timothy Wimbledon's decree has arrived, and I must comply. If he surrenders now and lays down his weapons, he will not be harmed, and I will escort him back to the capital with the treatment befitting a prince."
Assembling a large army is a very slow process. The knights gradually took their positions, while the mercenaries were still sluggishly gathering in front of the formation. Just then, Duke Ryan saw four flashes of light appear on the enemy's position—flashes that vanished as quickly as they had appeared, followed by rising puffs of smoke. He furrowed his brow, thinking he had seen something wrong, and was about to take a closer look with his telescope when a series of thunderous booms suddenly exploded by his ear!
