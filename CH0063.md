## Tales of the Past
Unfortunately, the good times did not last. In the winter of her fourteenth year, a refugee riot broke out in Silver City, and her parents, who were distributing food to the refugees, never returned. Nightingale and her younger brother were then sent to another branch of the Glan family, the home of her father's sibling.



It was also that winter when Nightingale awakened as a witch.



She carefully hid her abilities, but was still discovered by the elder Glan, who snatched away her brother and threatened Nightingale with her brother's life to make her work for him.



Nightingale had no choice but to comply. She was specially trained by thieves recruited by the elder Glan and then did some unsavory tasks for him, such as sneaking into the homes of business rivals to steal contracts and documents, eavesdropping on city hall meetings, and later even poisoning the water tanks or wine glasses of potential competitors.



The Glan family's business grew bigger and bigger, but their attitude towards Nightingale grew worse. With any slight displeasure, they would beat her. Apart from working for them, they kept Nightingale locked in a room with iron bars replacing the door. What saddened and puzzled Nightingale the most was that her brother Hyde almost never came to see her anymore. She began to suspect that the elder Glan might have already killed her brother.



After her incessant pleading, they reluctantly brought Hyde to her. However, Hyde told Nightingale with a look of disgust that he wished he didn't have a sister like her, that witches should go to hell to be with the devil.



Nightingale was devastated, but the nightmare was not over. The elder Glan delivered the final blow—her secret of being a witch had been revealed by Hyde himself, all to get as far away from the witch as possible.



After sending Hyde away, the elder Glan coldly warned her that her brother would inherit their father's title when he came of age, but if Nightingale did not continue to obey his commands, he could make her brother die quietly at any time.



And so, Nightingale, in despair and immense grief, was manipulated by the Glan family like a puppet. On her way back from completing a task in the snowy month of her coming of age, she met Wendy. Or rather, Wendy found her.



Upon learning that the Witch Cooperation Association still existed, that there were many sisters like her who had encountered misfortune yet had not given up resisting, a few sparks suddenly reignited in Nightingale's shattered heart.



It didn't take her long to go from confusion to determination. On her coming-of-age day a week later, she gritted her teeth and endured the torment, and her power underwent a drastic change. The Mist was not just for concealing her figure; she found that the iron bars could no longer stop her.



Once the symptoms of her coming-of-age day had subsided, she entered old Gran's bedroom like a ghost in the night and slit his throat with a dagger. Seeing the blood spurting several feet high and hearing his gasping breaths, she was surprised to find herself calmer than she had imagined.



After that, Nightingale left the Gran family, no longer caring about her brother Haiden.



And so, she set off with Wendy on a journey to find the Cooperation Association.



After Nightingale finished her story and waited a moment to see that the prince was still immersed in the past, she took her leave first. It took Roland a long time to snap back to reality, and he had to admit, every witch had a long and bitter history; those who survived to adulthood were the best of the best.



And as for himself, having crossed over and become a prince, he was luckier than he could have ever imagined.



Early the next morning, Roland went to Nightingale's room to visit Wendy.



After a whole night's rest, Wendy's complexion looked much better, and the arm that had been reattached had regained its color. Although she was still weak, she propped herself up to bow to the prince.



"I already know about your situation, thank you for saving Nightingale's life," Roland took out a piece of parchment from his bosom and got straight to the point, "There's no doubt that Cara will no longer accept you back into the Witch Cooperation Association. Why not stay in Border Town and serve me instead? If you agree, sign this contract. Your salary will be the same as Anna's, one Gold Royal per month."



"Your Highness..." Nightingale blinked, hesitating to speak.



Roland naturally knew what she wanted to say. Nightingale did not wish to pressure Wendy into making a decision so soon for the friend who had changed the trajectory of her life and saved her in the Impassable Mountain Range. In her view, as long as Wendy stayed in Border Town for a while, she would surely lean towards her side.



"I also hope not to rush into this matter, but some things become more dangerous with each day we delay," Roland paused for a moment, and Wendy did not interject, quietly waiting for what was to come, "I think I might know how a witch can get through her Day of Awakening unharmed."



"What?" Both witches changed their expressions and asked in unison.



"It's just speculation, and there's no concrete evidence," Roland waved his hand, "Witches are less likely to get hurt in the camp compared to when they are in exile. The only difference is that when you are in exile, you hide your identities, fearing that people will find out, while in the camp, you have to constantly use your abilities to maintain the day-to-day operations."



Wendy nodded, "What you said... isn't wrong."



"And when Anna was in the castle, she trained her abilities every day. Before her adult day, she even exhausted her magic power and fell into a coma. When she woke up, she had safely passed the most difficult hurdle for a witch, and without a scratch."



"So I think this might be the key to solving the problem of the demon biting the body. Witches are containers of magic power, and as they grow, magic power accumulates. When it exceeds the limit the body can bear, it causes harm to oneself. And the Evil Months are the times when a witch's power is at its strongest."



"If you can continuously release your own magic power and maintain it at a safe level, perhaps the agony of the Day of Awakening could be greatly reduced, or even disappear completely," Roland paused, then continued, "As the lord of Border Town, I can provide a place for witches to freely unleash their powers without the fear of being arrested, tried, or directly executed. If my guess is correct, then without a doubt, Border Town is the holy mountain you have long been searching for."



Witches have been taught from birth that this dangerous ability is a gift from the devil, and even those who are slightly aware only think that a power that constantly backlashes against oneself is a curse. It is a vicious cycle; the less you want to use it, the stronger the backlash becomes. However, Roland, as someone who has crossed over from another world, holds a completely opposite view of this power. After sifting through the memories of the fourth prince and dismissing the existence of a true god, he simply regards magic power as a form of energy, a special ability that he can control at will.



Wendy was silent for a long time before asking, "If I sign a contract and agree to serve you, may I ask... what do I need to do first?"



Over the centuries, some witches, due to their unique abilities, have been secretly imprisoned by a few ambitious individuals and used as expendable resources. Although the Church severely punishes such acts, it has been difficult to eradicate them completely. And when these people use witches, they are ruthless; once the witches lose their value, their fate is too horrible to witness.



Roland, of course, was aware of this, but he was looking at the long-term benefits, a win-win sustainable development system. He smiled and replied, "The first thing you need to do is to practice your ability repeatedly until you have complete mastery of it—just like Anna."
