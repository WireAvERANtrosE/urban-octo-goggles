## Decomposition and Restoration
Roland had spread out a variety of test props all over the office floor early in the morning.

From solids to liquids, minerals to metal ingots, inorganic to organic matter, there was everything one could think of.

"You seem pretty happy," Nightingale squatted down, pinched a small soup dumpling from the plate, and popped it into her mouth.

"Of course, the town has gained a new witch, and her ability is so incredible," Roland raised an eyebrow, "Also, don't think I didn't see you just now, sneaking a bite of the test sample, did you?"

"There are still several left," she wiped her mouth, "Is Lucia's ability very useful?"

"Extremely useful, whether it's decomposition or reduction, it can bring about significant progress to smelting and manufacturing," Roland said excitedly. "Paired with Anna, it could increase the strength of machinery by several times. Even if we can't mass produce, just manually making a few mother machines would be a qualitative improvement for the town's production level."

The machine tools currently used in the Greycastle Industrial Company's workshop were precisely machined by Anna. Although they were initially extremely accurate in scale, due to the inherent flaws in the materials, issues like wear and deformation of the machine tools during production were becoming more and more apparent, with broken and shattered tools being a common sight. Without Anna's maintenance and part replacements, these machine tools would last at most a year or two.

Lucia's ability made it possible to precisely control the composition of materials, allowing for the construction of machine tools made from high-strength cast iron, steel, or even alloys. This would not only improve their service life but also take processing efficiency and skill to a new level. For instance, something like the revolver, which currently could only be produced by Anna, could also enter the sequence of batch production.

"Is that so?" Nightingale hopped back onto the table, "But she doesn't seem to think so herself."



"Because she has yet to truly recognize the value of her abilities, just like Miya," Roland said nonchalantly. "If Lucia could fully comprehend 'The Basics of Natural Science Theory,' she would definitely not hold such thoughts anymore."

...

Nightingale silently stuffed two handfuls of dried fish into her mouth.

After Lucia finished her breakfast and came to the office, the ability test officially began.

Roland watched expectantly as she transformed one test item after another into piles or small heaps of different substances—iron ingots and iron ore both turned into silvery particles, and upon closer inspection, one could find some colored powder on the side. Grapes and steak remained unchanged, while the soup dumplings turned into water, bits of meat, and flour.

Halfway through the transformation, she suddenly stopped, looking somewhat embarrassed, "I seem to have... exhausted all my magic."

Roland looked towards Nightingale, who nodded, "The magic power stored inside her is very limited, it looks like a wisp of drifting smoke, but this is the first time I've seen such a color."

"What color?"

"…Grey," she said.

Roland returned to his desk and gestured to Lucia, "A witch's magic power grows with age and training. You are not yet of age, and what you have achieved so far is already very commendable." As the young girl approached the desk, he pushed a piece of prepared parchment towards her, "Since you've decided to stay in Border Town, sign this contract."



Lucia looked down at the end of the contract and couldn't help but gasp, "One Gold Royal per month? Your Highness... But, but my abilities haven't been fully tested yet?"



"Your abilities are irrelevant," Roland said with a smile, shaking his head. "As long as you are a member of the Witch Union, this contract is permanently valid."



"Even if a witch's abilities are completely useless?" she asked incredulously.



"You can think of it that way," the prince spread his hands and said, "but I believe that every witch's abilities have their unique uses, it's only a matter of discovering them sooner or later. So, you don't need to worry about being of no use." He paused for a moment, "Also, you should have already heard from the other witches about the true cause of magic bite. Therefore, to ensure a smooth Awakening Day, you must practice your abilities daily. After dinner, Teacher Scroll will give lessons to the witches in the parlor, and you should attend—even though you've already mastered reading and writing, elementary math and basic natural sciences are still necessary to learn."



"Yes, Your Highness." Lucia nodded vigorously.



"You have a younger sister, right?" Roland said with a smile. "When you go to class, bring her along too. It's time for her to receive an education as well."



Lucia was momentarily stunned, and after confirming that he wasn't joking, she bowed deeply and said, "As you command."



After the young girl left, Roland put the signed contract into a drawer and looked thoughtfully at the various test products scattered on the ground.



"How are the results?" Nightingale asked.



"Surprising," he lifted the plate containing the steamed buns, prodding at the finely minced meat and flour within, "Take this, for instance... Gluten in the flour forms a network structure when kneaded, giving the dough its stretchy resilience. Once steamed, the protein that makes up the gluten denatures due to the heat, and even if ground back into powder, it cannot return to its previous fine and smooth state. This transformation is irreversible, but..." Roland pinched a small clump of the powder and spread it on his palm, the texture was smooth, as if it were freshly milled flour, "She has reverted the flour back to its original state."



"Uh, I don't really understand," Nightingale pouted, "But that means her ability can be seen as restoring matter, right?"



"Not exactly," Roland pointed to the ingot, "If it was just restoration, the iron ingot should have reverted to iron ore, but in fact, it has been broken down into iron powder and other impurities."



"…So what exactly is her ability?" she asked, confused.



"It's not clear at the moment, but at least we can speculate. Perhaps her ability combines two effects, and the specific manifestation depends on her knowledge."



"Knowledge?"



"In essence, pork chops are no different from iron ore; they are both composed of various particles. However, Lucia's ability can only decompose iron ore and not act on pork chops. I think it's probably because she doesn't understand the composition of organic matter... or rather, the composition of living things," Roland explained. He wasn't sure if his speculation was correct, but there was no doubt that Lucia was the one who needed to learn and supplement her knowledge as soon as possible.



...

Three days later, when the second fleet carrying refugees from the Eastern Region arrived at the town, the same epidemic broke out on board, and this time it was more severe, with nearly half of the people infected. Roland learned through questioning that some of the patients had shown symptoms of black spots on the first day after boarding the ship, which meant that they had been parasitized by the strange bugs earlier, and therefore the incubation period had been significantly reduced.



Meanwhile, Roland also received a letter sent from the capital, sealed with the mark of the Margaret Trading Company.



After reading the contents of the letter, his brow furrowed.



The demonic plague was rampantly spreading throughout the capital, and the Church claimed it was a conspiracy of the witches, telling the people they possessed a sacred medicine to combat the plague. A large number of infected individuals had also appeared outside the city of the capital, and for safety reasons, Tassa decided to temporarily cease the transportation of refugees.



If his timing was not miscalculated, the first returning fleet would arrive back at the capital in four days, bringing news that the town had a cure for the demonic plague. However, those who had already been infected were unlikely to survive the nearly week-long journey on the ship, and the Church's propaganda also gave him a whiff of a conspiracy.



After much consideration, he decided to dispatch a team to escort Lily to the capital. Otherwise, the people of the capital and the refugees from the Eastern Region would perish in large numbers in this man-made disaster, and those who survived would become devout followers of the Church.



Roland had to avoid such a situation as much as possible.
