## Decomposition and Reduction
Roland had laid out a variety of test props all over the floor of his office early in the morning.

From solids to liquids, minerals to metal ingots, inorganic substances to organic substances, everything was there.

"You seem quite happy," Nightingale squatted down, pinched a small soup dumpling from the plate, and popped it into her mouth.

"Of course, the town has gained a new witch, and her ability is so incredible," Roland raised his eyebrows, "Also, don't think I didn't see it, you just snuck a taste of the test sample, didn't you?"

"There are still several left," she wiped her mouth, "Is Lucia's ability very useful?"

"Extremely useful, whether it's decomposition or reduction, it can bring great progress to smelting and manufacturing," Roland said excitedly. "Paired with Anna, it could increase the strength of machinery by several times. Even if we can't mass-produce, just manually making a few mother machines would be a qualitative improvement for the town's production level."

The machine tools currently used in the Greycastle Industrial Company factory were precisely processed by Anna. Although they were extremely accurate at the beginning, due to the inherent flaws in the materials, issues like wear and deformation of the machine tools during the production process became increasingly obvious, and the breaking and shattering of tools were common occurrences. If it weren't for Anna replenishing and maintaining parts, these machine tools would last at most one or two years.

With Lucia's ability, precise control of material composition becomes possible. Using high-strength cast iron, steel, or even alloy to make machine tools would not only increase their lifespan but also improve the efficiency and level of machining. For example, the revolver, which currently can only be produced by Anna, could also enter the sequence of batch production.

"Is that so?" Nightingale hopped back onto the table, "But she doesn't seem to think so herself."



"Because she has yet to truly recognize the value of her power, just like Miya," Roland said nonchalantly. "If Lucia were to fully read 'The Basics of Natural Science Theory', she definitely wouldn't hold such thoughts anymore."



Nightingale silently stuffed two handfuls of dried fish into her mouth.



When Lucia finished her breakfast and came to the office, the ability test officially began.



Roland watched with anticipation as she transformed various test items into piles or small heaps of different substances—the iron ingots and iron ore both turned into silver-white granules, and upon closer inspection, one could find some specks of colored powder on the side. Grapes and steak remained unchanged, while the xiaolongbao turned into water, meat crumbs, and flour.



Halfway through the transformation, she suddenly stopped and said with some embarrassment, "I seem to have... exhausted all my magic."



Roland looked at Nightingale, who nodded, "The magic power stored in her body is very little, it looks like a wisp of drifting smoke, but this is the first time I've seen such a color."



"What color?"



"Gray," she said.



Roland returned to his desk and beckoned to Lucia, "A witch's magic power grows with age and training. You're not yet an adult, and to have come this far is already quite remarkable." As the young girl approached the desk, he pushed a piece of prepared parchment towards her, "Since you've decided to stay in Border Town, go ahead and sign this contract."



Lucia looked down at the end of the contract and couldn't help but gasp, "One Gold Royal per month? Your Highness... But, but my abilities haven't been fully tested yet?"



"It's irrelevant to your abilities," Roland said with a smile, shaking his head. "As long as you are a member of the Witch Union, this contract is effective forever."



"Even if a witch's abilities are completely useless?" she asked incredulously.



"You can think of it that way," the prince spread his hands, "but I believe that every witch's abilities have their unique uses, it's just a matter of discovering them sooner or later. So you don't need to worry about being of no use." He paused, "Additionally, you should have already heard from the other witches the real reason for the demonic bite, so to ensure that you successfully get through your Day of Awakening, you must practice your abilities every day. After dinner, Teacher Scroll will be giving lessons in the parlor for the witches, and you should attend—even though you've already mastered reading and writing, it's still necessary to learn elementary mathematics and the basics of natural studies."



"Yes, Your Highness," Lucia nodded vigorously.



"You also have a sister, right?" Roland said with a smile. "When you go to class, bring her along. She's also reached the age to receive an education."



Lucia was momentarily stunned, then looked up to confirm he was not joking and bowed happily, "I will obey."



After the young girl had left, Roland put the signed contract into the drawer and gazed thoughtfully at the various test products on the ground.



"How did it go?" Nightingale asked.



"It's surprising," he said, lifting the plate filled with steamed buns and fiddling with the finely chopped meat and flour inside. "For example, this... When kneading, the gluten in the flour forms a network structure, giving the dough its flexible elasticity. Once it's steamed, the protein that makes up the gluten denatures due to the high temperature, and it's impossible to revert it back to that previous fine and smooth state, even if it's ground into powder again. This transformation is irreversible, but..." Roland picked up a small clump of powder and spread it out on his palm, the texture was smooth, as if it was freshly milled flour, "She managed to revert the flour back to its original state."



"Uh, I don't quite understand," Nightingale pouted, "But from what you're saying, her power can be seen as restoring substances?"



"Not exactly," Roland pointed at the ingot, "If it was just about restoration, the iron ingot should have turned back into iron ore, but in fact, it was decomposed into iron powder and other impurities."



"...Then what exactly is her power?" she asked, confused.



"We're not clear on that yet, but we can at least speculate. Perhaps her power encompasses two effects, and the specific form it takes depends on her understanding."



"Understanding?"



"In essence, pork chops and iron ore aren't that different, they're both composed of a variety of particles, but Lucia's power can only decompose iron ore and not act on pork chops. I think it's probably because she can't understand organic matter... or to put it another way, the composition of living beings," Roland explained. He wasn't sure if his guess was correct, but without a doubt, Lucia was the person who most urgently needed to learn and supplement her knowledge.



...



Three days later, when the second fleet carrying refugees from the Eastern Region arrived at the town, the same disease broke out on board, and this time it was more severe, with almost half of the people infected. Roland learned through questioning that some of the patients had shown symptoms of black spots on the first day after boarding, which meant that they had been parasitized by strange insects earlier, and thus the incubation period was significantly shorter.



Meanwhile, Roland also received a letter sent back from the capital, sealed with the mark of the Margrave Merchant Guild.



After reading the contents of the letter, his brow furrowed.



The demonic plague was spreading wildly in the capital, and the Church claimed it was a conspiracy by witches, informing the public that they possessed a holy medicine capable of combating the demonic plague. A large number of infected people had also appeared outside the city of the capital. Theo, out of safety concerns, chose to temporarily halt the transportation of refugees.



If the timing was not misjudged, the first fleet to return would reach the capital in four days, bringing news of the town's cure for the demonic plague. However, those who had already been infected were unlikely to survive the nearly one-week journey on the ship, and the Church's proclamation also gave off a hint of conspiracy to him.



After much consideration, he decided to dispatch a team to escort Lily to the capital. Otherwise, the people of the capital and the refugees from the Eastern Region would die in droves in this man-made disaster, and those who survived would all become devout followers of the Church.



Roland had to avoid such a situation as much as possible.
