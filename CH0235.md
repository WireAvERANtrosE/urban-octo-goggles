## Unexpected Letter
Roland unfurled the letter while simultaneously handing Maggie a piece of beef jerky.



"Goo!" The latter opened her mouth to catch the jerky, swallowing it in two or three bites, then obediently lay down by the table, burying her head in her feathers.



"Dear brother, or should I say, 'Prince Roland Wimbledon,' I have received your letter and I deeply agree with your views. Although I am uncertain why you have suddenly changed, abandoning your previous frivolous lifestyle and choosing to help witches, now that you have, the Church has become our common enemy."



"Perhaps you already know, I have become a witch, which is why everyone is willing to trust me. Yet you are a prince, a true noble, and the fact that you have earned the trust of so many witches is incredibly astonishing. Ever since I heard about you, I have been wondering how you managed to do this. If you were like other nobles, using witches as tools, you wouldn't have gained Ashes' approval, and she would not have chosen to leave Maggie in Border Town."



"Furthermore, I am very interested in the steam engine mentioned by Maggie, as well as the idea that knowledge can advance one's abilities. Especially the latter, I hope to have the opportunity to discuss this with you in detail."



"As for your invitation, after much thought, I find no reason to refuse. The establishment of an alliance requires trust and contribution. If we both hesitate and cower, it will only benefit the Church. Therefore, I have attached a list of most of the auxiliary abilities of the witches from Sleeping Island at the end of this letter, from which you can choose the abilities you need most and inform me through Maggie. If all goes well, they will set out for your territory next month. For safety reasons, it is best not to exceed five witches at a time."



"Additionally, please designate a reliable pickup and escort plan, and send protection. The loss of any witch is a significant blow to both Border Town and Sleeping Island, and will cast a shadow over our cooperation. I hope you will take good care of them, just as you do with your own witches. If possible, please also allow them to participate in the evening classes on basic knowledge. I believe that any witch who becomes stronger is good news for us both."



"Just as you have said, the Church is at the end of its tether, and the annexation of the four major kingdoms is only a matter of time. I hope by the time that day arrives, you are well-prepared. If it proves difficult to resist, Sleeping Island will be your sanctuary. Of course, in the fight against the Church's invasion, I will also offer as much help as possible.



"Finally, may we put an end to the Church's oppression and build together a new order—a new kingdom where not only witches, but no one will suffer from groundless persecution."

"Your sister, Tilly Wimbledon."



Roland set down the letter, his heart filled with an indescribable joy. He chuckled as he put away the letter and took out a piece of beef jerky to offer to Maggie.



She immediately stretched out her head and pecked away the food. "Coo, coo coo!"



He stroked her neck's soft feathers, and she contentedly squinted her eyes.



"It's been tough, but Lightning went with the fleet to the King's City and probably won't be back for a few days," Roland said with a smile. "You can go play with Nana or Leaf, or go to the bathhouse for a soak and then get some sleep."



"Coo... coo!" Maggie flapped her wings and then, with a leap from the table, flew out the window, quickly disappearing from sight.



What she just said must have been 'I'm not tired, I'm going to find them to play,' Roland realized that even when she spoke in her pigeon form, he could now understand the general meaning.



...Is this the power of habit?



That being said, he never expected that Tilly would actually accept his invitation, even attaching a list of the witches' abilities—this was simply a treasure trove! Although the letter did not specify how long they could stay, completing the entire primary education curriculum would take at least half a year. If he added in "The Hundred Thousand Whys" to extend the course to a year, how much change could these witches bring to Border Town?



Moreover, their evolution brought far more benefits than drawbacks to him—staying in the town could efficiently promote development, and even if they were to return to Sleeping Island, they would still be a living advertisement. With word of mouth from these people, the number of witches willing to go to Border Town would only increase, and Tilly would not be able to stop this trend. Roland believed that sincere treatment, rather than bribery or coercion, was the real long-term plan.



All in all, the reply brought him a surprise far greater than expected. The openness and positivity of the other party made him feel like he had encountered a divine teammate. With this, he was no longer alone in his fight against the Church. As for the safe transportation route, he had already thought it through—avoiding Clearwater Port and the Seawind Region, landing directly on the deserted beaches south of Border Town. After reaching the hilly area, they would take a hot air balloon over the mountains, directly into the heart of the town, without having to worry about the forces of the Church, Timothy, or Garcia.



The more he thought about it, the more excited Roland became. He resisted the urge to immediately browse the appendix and select witches, focusing on the task at hand—after all, even if Sleeping Island dispatched witches as soon as possible, it would be next month's affair, while the most pressing issue Border Town faced now was housing construction.



Ever since the First Army went to the capital, refugees transported from there had been arriving in the town in an endless stream. To prevent the recurrence of the demonic plague, Roland had arranged for them to stay outside the western city walls—there, a long row of wooden sheds had been erected for the refugees to live in temporarily. Together with the serfs farming by the Redwater River, the total number of these two groups had exceeded eight thousand. If refugees continued to arrive for a few more days, this number was likely to break the ten thousand mark.



Feeding these people was not a problem. After all, since the Evil Months, Border Town had never stopped importing food. However, the accommodation problem was clearly a big trouble. It was summer now, and living in simple wooden sheds was manageable. Besides providing shade and shelter from the rain, they were also very ventilated, just with more mosquito bites. But once winter came, the wooden sheds were no different from being outdoors. The temperature inside the sheds was the same as outside. If they were not moved into brick houses, most would not survive the long winter. In other words, Border Town must build residences and dormitories that could house ten thousand people within the remaining six months.



Roland spread out a piece of paper and began to write quickly.



He planned to divert some of the workers who were building the kingdom's main road to housing construction. After all, delaying the road for ten days to half a month was not a big problem, but people freezing to death in his territory would be a serious blot on his record. Even when he first transmigrated, facing the dire situation of having neither money nor people, no one had frozen or starved to death during the first Evil Months. Now, with the Witch Union and the steam engine, along with ample income and manpower, he naturally would not allow such a situation to occur.



At this moment, Carter suddenly walked into the office.



"Your Highness, there's some bad news," he said with a grave expression, "There has been an explosion in your chemical laboratory just now."
