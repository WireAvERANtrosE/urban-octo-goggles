## An Unexpected Letter
Roland unfolded the letter and at the same time handed a piece of beef jerky to Maggie.

"Coo!" The latter snapped up the jerky, gulping it down in two or three bites, then obediently lay beside the table, burying her head in her feathers.

"Dear brother, or should I say, 'Prince Roland Wimbledon,'"

"I have received your letter and fully agree with your views. Although I am not sure why you have suddenly changed your ways, abandoning your previous frivolous lifestyle and actually willing to help witches, since you have done so, the Church has become our common enemy."

"Perhaps you are already aware, I have become a witch, and that is the reason everyone is willing to believe in me. Yet you are a prince, a noble through and through, to gain the trust of so many witches is truly incredible. Ever since I learned of your actions, I have often wondered how you managed to do this? If you were like other nobles, using witches as tools, you would never have earned Ashes' approval, and she would not have chosen to let Maggie stay in Border Town."

"In addition, I am very interested in the steam engine mentioned by Maggie, as well as the concept that knowledge promotes the evolution of abilities. Especially the latter, I hope to have the opportunity to discuss this with you in detail."

"As for your invitation, after much consideration, I find that I have no reason to refuse. The formation of an alliance requires trust and commitment. If we both hesitate and cower, in the end, only the Church will benefit. Therefore, I have listed most of the supporting witches' abilities from Sleeping Island at the end of this letter. You can choose the abilities you need the most and inform me through Maggie. If all goes well, they will set out for your territory next month. For safety reasons, it is best to not exceed five witches at a time."

"Furthermore, please specify a reliable transportation plan and arrange for protection. The loss of any witch is a significant blow to both Border Town and Sleeping Island and would cast a shadow over our cooperation. I hope you will take good care of them as you do your own witches. If possible, please also allow them to participate in the evening basic knowledge classes. I believe that any witch whose abilities become stronger is good news for us."

"As you said, the Church is desperate and it is only a matter of time before they consume the four major kingdoms. I hope that when that day comes, you are prepared to face it. Should you find it difficult to resist, Sleeping Island will be your haven. Of course, I will provide as much help as possible in resisting the Church's invasion."



"In the end, may we put an end to the Church's oppression and build a new order together—a new kingdom where not only witches, but no one will be subjected to groundless persecution."

"Your sister, Tilly Wimbledon."

Roland put down the letter, his heart filled with an indescribable joy. He chuckled as he put away the letter and took out a piece of beef jerky, offering it to Maggie.

She immediately extended her head and pecked away the food. "Co-coo, co-coo!"

He stroked the smooth feathers on her neck, and she closed her eyes contentedly.

"It's been hard on you, but Lightning has followed the fleet to the capital and it will probably be a few more days before she returns," Roland said with a smile. "You can go play with Nana or Leaf, or take a bath and have a good sleep first."

"Co...coo!" Maggie flapped her wings and then leapt from the table, flying out of the window and quickly disappearing from sight.

What she just said must have been "I'm not tired, I'm going to find them to play," Roland realized that even when she was speaking in her pigeon form, he could understand the general idea.

...Is this the power of habit?



Returning to the matter at hand, he never expected that Tilly would actually agree to his invitation, and even attached a list of the witches' abilities—it was truly a treasure trove! Although the letter did not specify how long they would be able to stay, completing the entire primary education course would take at least half a year. If he could add in "The Hundred Thousand Whys" to extend the curriculum to a year, how much change could these witches bring to Border Town?



Moreover, after their evolution, the benefits to him far outweighed the drawbacks—staying in the town would efficiently promote development, and even if they were sent back to Sleeping Island, they would be living symbols of propaganda. With word of mouth among these people, more and more witches would be willing to go to Border Town, and Tilly would not be able to stop this trend. Roland believed that treating them with sincerity, rather than enticing or intimidating them, was the true long-term strategy.



All in all, the reply brought him far more surprises than expected, and the openness and positivity of the other party made him feel like he had met an incredible ally. With this, he was no longer fighting alone against the Church. As for a safe route of transport, he had already considered it thoroughly—avoiding Clearwater Harbor or the Sea Breeze Duchy, landing directly on the uninhabited beaches south of Border Town. After reaching the hilly area, they would take a hot air balloon over the mountains, landing directly in the hinterlands of the town, without having to worry about the forces of the Church, Timothy, or Grace.



The more Roland thought about it, the more excited he became. He managed to restrain his impulse to immediately browse the appendix and select witches, turning his attention to the matters at hand—after all, even if the witches from Sleeping Island were dispatched quickly, they wouldn't arrive until the next month, and the most pressing issue facing Border Town right now was housing construction.



Ever since the First Army went to the capital, refugees transported from there had been continuously arriving in the town. To prevent the resurgence of the demonic plague, Roland arranged for them to stay outside the western city walls—where a long row of wooden shacks had been erected for the refugees to temporarily reside. Including the serfs farming by the Redwater River, the total number of these two groups had already exceeded eight thousand. If refugees continued to arrive for a few more days, this number could very well surpass ten thousand.



Feeding these people was not a problem, as Border Town had never stopped importing food since the Evil Months, but accommodation was clearly a big issue. It was summer now, and living in simple wooden shacks was manageable; besides providing shade and shelter from rain, they were also very ventilated, though there were more insect bites. However, once winter came, living in the shacks would be almost like staying outdoors—the temperature inside would be the same as outside. If they were not moved into brick houses, most of them would not survive the long winter. In other words, Border Town must build enough residences and dormitories to accommodate ten thousand people within the remaining six months.



Roland spread out a piece of paper and began to write quickly.



He planned to divert some of the workers from the construction of the kingdom's main road to housing construction. After all, delaying the roadworks by ten days to half a month was not a big issue, but having people freeze to death within his domain would be a huge blot on his record. Even when he had just transmigrated and faced a dire situation with neither money nor manpower, no one had died of freezing or starvation during the first Evil Months. Now, with the Witch Union and steam engines, as well as ample income and manpower, he naturally would not allow such a situation to occur.



Just then, Carter suddenly entered the office.



"Your Highness, there is some bad news," he said with a serious expression, "Your chemical laboratory has just exploded."
