## Negotiations (Part 1)
After visiting the steam engine on site, Roland and Margaret returned to the office in the castle to continue discussing the details of the trade agreement. Such negotiations often involve haggling and can last a day or two, which is usually handled by the Minister of Finance. The lord only needs to give the quantity and the bottom line. However, since the other party had already settled on the price, Roland also saved a lot of trouble.



"I expect the next time I come will be in a month. By then, there will be three single-masted sailing ships loaded with saltpeter arriving with me," the female merchant wrote quickly on the parchment. "Calculated at ninety percent of the market price, that would be about three hundred and fifteen Gold Royals."



"By that time, the town should be able to produce two steam engines," Roland deliberately understated the number, "which would be one thousand Gold Royals. You can make up the difference with Gold Royals, or you can use other goods to replace it."



"What kind of goods do you need?"



"Iron, copper, lead, green vitriol," he said, "all common minerals. However, for the first three, I need not the ore but metal ingots that have been smelted. Additionally, I need ten sets of crystal glassware. It doesn't matter whether they are engraved or whether they are water jugs or wine glasses, but they must be the highest quality products from the Royal Capital's alchemical workshops. If the price exceeds the difference, I can make up the difference or deduct it from the cost of the next month's two steam engines."



"You're treating me as your exclusive merchant," Margaret chuckled, "Although I don't operate mines, I know a few colleagues who specialize in ore trading. But I never imagined that such a remote and desolate place could contain such great business opportunities. There are hardly any nobles living here, yet there is a huge demand for saltpeter; a town established for the Northslope Mine, yet it still has to purchase minerals from outside. This simply defies my merchant's common sense. Your Highness, your territory is too incredible."



A major characteristic of industrial production is the mass consumption of raw materials and the export of finished products. Roland spread his hands, "In the future, the town will need even more. I think we can reach a long-term—"



Just then, Margaret suddenly widened her eyes in surprise, staring behind Roland. He was taken aback, turned his head subconsciously, and saw Lightning drenched to the skin, clinging to the floor-to-ceiling window, hands pressed against the glass, her face full of panic—her face was pale, strands of hair stuck to her forehead, droplets of water continuously dripping down her hair as if she had just been fished out of the water.



Roland hurriedly got up to open the window, and after Lightning flew into the room, she threw herself into Roland's arms. Her frantic expression immediately relaxed, and her body went limp as she fainted.



"Nightingale, hurry and call for Nana," he said anxiously.



"Yes." A voice responded from the empty space beside him.



What's going on? She shouldn't encounter demonic beasts or devils in the sky; could it be that the opponent also has the ability to fly? Roland briefly examined Lightning's body and, finding no obvious external injuries, he breathed a sigh of relief.



"Your Highness, is she... the Lightning you spoke of?" Margaret covered her mouth, slowly approaching the prince, carefully examining the little girl in his arms.



Roland's heart skipped a beat; damn, how could he have forgotten about her. He shouted towards the door: "Shawn!"



His personal guard walked into the office in response.



"I'm sorry, Miss Margaret, but you'll have to stay here for a while," the prince said as he stood up with Lightning in his arms, "Take this capital's merchant to a guest room on the first floor and keep her under surveillance. Without my order, she is not to be let out."



"At your command!"



"What? No, Your Highness... please wait," she suddenly realized, "I bear no ill will towards witches, moreover, she is the daughter of thunder, I would not report to the church—"



"I'm just being cautious," Roland interrupted, "Later on, I will come to verify with you."



...



"Your Highness, she has awakened," Nightingale opened the door and said.



Roland nodded and followed Nightingale into the bedroom. The bucket beside the bed was still steaming, and the soaked clothes were casually hung on the edge of the bucket. A group of witches surrounded the bedside, with Wendy sitting at the head of the bed, gently combing the little girl's hair which wasn't completely dry yet. Lightning, who previously had a pale face, now had some color in her cheeks. She was leaning against two stacks of pillows, with the quilt pulled up high, revealing only half of her head, and her eyes staring straight at Roland.



"How is she?"



"She's uninjured, it was a coma caused by the depletion of her magic power," Nightingale replied, "Wendy helped her clean her body, and not long after she was placed in the quilt, she woke up."



He walked to the bedside, smiled at Lightning, "What happened? What made you fly back in such a panic through the rain?"



"I found the ruins," she muttered softly, "But there were devils inside."



This statement made everyone's faces change color.



"Did you go in?" Scroll asked.



"No," Lightning shook her head and recounted the event, "The devil was guarding the entrance to the basement, and someone inside was calling for help. But I was too scared and only thought about running away. I didn't try to rescue her." She tucked her head further into the blanket, "Does this mean I'm not qualified to be an explorer anymore?"



"No, you did well," Roland comforted her, "A good explorer knows how to assess the situation and won't take unnecessary risks. You couldn't have saved her on your own; running away was the right choice."



"Is the one in the stone tower a witch?" Wendy pondered, "Other than witches, no one can reach the depths of the Misty Forest."



"Witches wouldn't go there either," Scroll shook her head, "That's a relic from 450 years ago. Without a map to show the way, finding the stone tower in the vast sea of trees is as hard as reaching the heavens. Unless..."



"Unless what?" Roland asked.



"Unless someone has been living there all along," Scroll said slowly.



"Do you mean to say they didn't set out from the kingdom, but have been there since 450 years ago, continuing their lineage in isolation from the world?" The prince dismissed the speculation in his mind. Living in a primeval forest, what did that entail! The elusive wild beasts, various terrifying insects and poisons, no stable source of food... Even Bear Grylls couldn't live in the forest for long. Not to mention, this world also had winters with months of endless heavy snow, plus demonic beasts and devils roaming around. Settling in the Misty Forest was simply a death wish. He looked at Lightning, "Were there any traces of human habitation near the ruins?"



"No." The little girl shook her head.



"Perhaps there is more than one map," Soria said. "It's possible that others are searching for the whereabouts of Taquila like us."

"Regardless, we can't help them," Leaf sighed. "Aside from Lightning, no one can quickly get to the stone tower."

"We won't know the true situation until we get there," Roland stroked his chin. "In any case, it's good that everyone returned safely. Let's put a hold on tonight's lessons; everyone should rest well. When the time comes, the puzzle will naturally be solved."

Leaving Lightning's bedroom, he said to Nightingale, "Next, we have another trouble to deal with."

"As long as she takes off the God's Punishment Stone," she smiled, "leave everything to me."
