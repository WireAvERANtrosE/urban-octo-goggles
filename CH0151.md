## Negotiations (Part 1)
After observing the steam engine on site, Roland and Margaret returned to the office in the castle, continuing to discuss the details of the trade agreement. These negotiations would often involve haggling and could last for days, which is why they were usually handled by the Minister of Finance; the lord would only need to specify the quantity and the bottom line. However, since the other party had already agreed upon a price, Roland was spared much effort.



"I expect that my next visit will be in a month's time, by which there will be three single-masted sailboats laden with saltpeter arriving with me," the female merchant wrote swiftly on the parchment. "Calculated at ninety percent of the market price, that would roughly amount to three hundred and fifteen gold royals."



"By then the town should be able to produce two steam engines," Roland deliberately understated the number, "which is one thousand gold royals. You can make up the difference with gold royals or substitute with other goods."



"What kind of goods would you need?"



"Iron, copper, lead, and green vitriol," he said, "these are all common minerals. However, for the first three, I need them not as ores but as smelted metal ingots. In addition, I also need ten sets of crystal glassware; it doesn't matter whether they are engraved or whether they are water jugs or wine glasses, but they must be the finest products from the alchemy workshops in the capital. If the price exceeds the difference, I can make up for it or deduct it from the cost of the next month's two steam engines."



"You're treating me as your personal merchant," Margaret chuckled. "Although I do not operate mines, I do know a few peers who specialize in ore trade. But I never expected that a remote and desolate place could hold such great business opportunities. It has few nobles residing here, yet it consumes a large amount of saltpeter; a town established for the North Slope Mine but still needs to import minerals. This simply defies my merchant's common sense, Your Highness, your territory is too incredible."



One of the main characteristics of industrialized production is the massive intake of raw materials and the output of finished goods. Roland spread his hands, "In the future, the town will need even more. I think we can reach a long-term—"



At this moment, Margaret suddenly widened her eyes, looking behind Roland with an astonished expression. He was taken aback, turning his head subconsciously, only to see Lightning, completely drenched, clinging to the French window with both hands pressed against the glass, her face full of panic—her complexion was pale, strands of hair stuck to her forehead, and droplets of water kept dripping down her hair, as if she had just been fished out of the water.



Roland quickly got up to open the window, and as Lightning flew into the room and threw herself into Roland's arms, her frantic expression immediately relaxed, and she fainted.



"Nightingale, quickly call Nana over," he said anxiously.

"Yes," came a reply from the empty space beside him.

What's going on? She shouldn't have encountered demonic beasts or devils in the air. Could it be that the enemy also has the ability to fly? Roland quickly checked Lightning's body and found no visible injuries, which allowed him to breathe a sigh of relief.

"Your Highness, is she... the Lightning you spoke of?" Margaret covered her mouth, slowly approaching the prince and carefully examining the little girl in his arms.

Roland's heart skipped a beat. Damn, how could he have forgotten about her? He shouted towards the door, "Shawn!"

The personal guard responded and entered the office.

"Sorry, Miss Margaret, but you'll have to stay here for a while," the prince said as he stood up with Lightning in his arms, "Take this capital merchant to the guest room on the first floor and keep her under surveillance. Without my command, she is not to be released."

"As you command!"

"What? No, Your Highness... please wait," she suddenly realized, "I mean no harm to the witch, and besides, she is the daughter of Thunder. I would not report her to the Church—"



"I'm just being cautious," Roland interrupted, "Later on, I'll come to verify it with you."

...

"Your Highness, she has awakened," Nightingale said as she opened the door.

Roland nodded and followed Nightingale into the bedroom. The bucket of water next to the large bed was still steaming, and the drenched clothes were hanging carelessly on the edge of the bucket. A group of witches surrounded the bed, with Wendy sitting at the head of the bed, gently combing the little girl's hair that was not yet completely dry. Lightning, whose face had previously been devoid of color, now had a slight blush and was leaning against two stacks of pillows, with the blanket pulled up high, revealing only half of her head, her eyes staring straight at Roland.

"How is she?"

"She's not injured; it's a coma caused by the depletion of her magic power," Nightingale replied. "Wendy helped her wash up and brought her to bed, and not long after that, she woke up."

He walked to the bedside and smiled at Lightning, "What happened? What made you rush back in the rain so frantically?"

"I found the ruins," she muttered softly, "but there were devils inside."

At these words, everyone's face changed.



"Did you go in?" Scroll asked.

"No," Lightning shook her head and recounted what had happened, "The devil was guarding the entrance to the basement, and there was someone inside calling for help. But I was too scared, and just thought about running away without trying to save her." She buried her head deeper into the blanket, "Does this mean I'm not fit to be an explorer?"

"No, you did very well," Roland comforted, "A good explorer knows how to assess the situation and wouldn't recklessly put themselves in danger. You couldn't have saved her on your own; running away was the right choice."

"Is the one in the stone tower a witch?" Wendy pondered, "Other than witches, no one could reach the depths of the Misty Forest."

"A witch wouldn't go there either," Scroll shook her head, "That's a relic from 450 years ago. Without a map to guide the way, finding the location of the stone tower in the vast sea of trees would be as hard as ascending to heaven. Unless..."

"Unless what?" Roland asked.

"Unless someone has been living there all along," Scroll said slowly.

"Do you mean to say they didn't set out from the kingdom but have been there since 450 years ago, continuing their lineage and living in isolation from the world?" The prince dismissed the guess in his mind. Living in a primeval forest, what did that entail! The elusive wild beasts, various terrifying insects and poisons, a lack of a stable food source... Even Bear Grylls couldn't possibly live in a forest for long. Not to mention in this world there are winters with months of endless snowfall, plus demonic beasts and devils running amok. Settling in the Misty Forest would be a death wish. He looked at Lightning, "Were there any signs of human habitation near the ruins?"

"No." The little girl shook her head.



"Perhaps there's more than one map," Solya said. "It's possible that others are searching for the whereabouts of Taquila just like us."

"Regardless, we can't help them," Leaf sighed. "Apart from Lightning, no one can reach the stone tower quickly."

"We'll only know the true situation once we get there," Roland stroked his chin. "Anyway, it's good that everyone came back safe and sound. Let's suspend tonight's lesson for a day and let everyone rest. When the time comes, the puzzle will naturally be solved."

Leaving Lightning's bedroom, he said to Nightingale, "Next, we have another problem to deal with."

"As long as she takes off the Divine Stone of Judgement," she smiled, "leave everything to me."
