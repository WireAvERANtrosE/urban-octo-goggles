## New Witch, New Ability (Part 2)
The third witch was called Hummingbird, a petite woman who was as tiny as her nickname suggested. She was much more reserved than the other witches when asked about her abilities. Having just come of age this winter, her symmetrical dimples, delicate features, combined with a soft voice, made her exceptionally cute.



Her ability was "lightening objects," which allowed her to attach magic to an object and significantly reduce its weight, almost to zero according to her. When Roland asked Hummingbird to demonstrate with his teacup, he found that the cup could almost float in the air—which meant its weight was roughly equivalent to that of air. Of course, to people in this era, air was considered weightless.



It seemed that this was also the reason why the Witch Cooperation Association could traverse the western border of Greycastle without the need for resupply. With the young girl's help, sacks of wheat and dried fish could easily be carried on their journey, allowing a few people to carry a large amount of supplies, significantly reducing logistical pressure.



Although Hummingbird was of age, she had not developed any derivative abilities. Her main ability required physical contact with the target and was ineffective on living organisms. The larger the object, the longer the conversion time and the more magic required. Once the conversion was complete, it could last for several hours.



This ability seemed very suitable for the transportation industry and could be of great use in the upcoming war. However, too many unknown factors remained, and further experiments were necessary to confirm its efficacy.



At the bottom of the parchment, Roland wrote: Practice with stones of different weights as targets, control the output of magic to make the activation and deactivation time precise and controllable.



After finishing the training plans for the three witches, he asked his attendant to add another candlestick to the room to make it brighter. Nevertheless, reading and writing under the flickering orange-yellow candlelight remained a strain on the eyes.



Roland yawned and spread out the parchment with information about the fourth witch.



This fourth witch had the rare addition of a surname; her full name was Soraya Zoen, hailing from a merchant family in Greycastle's capital. She had a head of brown curly hair and a pair of slender eyes. The light sprinkling of freckles on her nose did not detract from her overall beauty; instead, they lent her a unique youthful vitality.



Soraya had just turned nineteen and her ability was quite special. After reaching adulthood, she could draw the people and scenery she saw or imagined with lifelike accuracy. Coupled with her secondary ability, "Magic Pen," she could paint images as real as photographs without the need for paint or paper.

This camera-like ability had countless uses. As for training, she could simply draw a few pictures every day.

He then pulled out the next piece of paper.



The fifth witch was named Echo, a tall woman from the Southernmost Region with coffee-colored skin and the typical features of the Sand People, exuding an exotic charm. According to her story, after awakening, she could initially mimic the cries of animals, but as an adult, she could imitate any sound perfectly, without any secondary abilities.

Roland named her ability "Phantom Sound," and although he hadn't figured out its use yet, the training requirement was... well, just to holler a few times.

The sixth witch to be interviewed was Lily, who was only sixteen this year. With twin ponytails and a face as delicate as a porcelain doll, she looked a bit stiff when she saw him. Her ability was to prevent food from spoiling. It had only been a year since she awakened as a witch, and she had become the most popular figure in the Mutual Aid Society—without her preservative ability, many foods would have spoiled and molded during their exodus. Together with Hummingbird, Lily supported the logistics of the Mutual Aid Society.

As for whether this preservative ability was achieved by magically killing bacteria, it remained to be verified. Roland decided to have her practice with various meats and fruits and to test the longest preservation time when her magic was depleted.

He rubbed his sore neck and stacked the information of these six witches, leaving only the last piece of parchment on the table.

This was also another surprise that Roland had found after Leaves.



The seventh witch: Miya.



At that time, she appeared very nervous when she walked into the office. Nightingale comforted her for a while, and even briefly explained the reason to her in her ear.



It turned out that Miya's ability was also considered one of the worst in the camp, almost useless, and she was only responsible for miscellaneous tasks that relied purely on manpower. Coupled with the fact that she was often blamed by Cara, she acted timidly, fearing that Roland would find her useless and drive her out of Border Town.



Her main ability was to magnetize objects, which before adulthood was limited to metal items. After reaching adulthood, any object in her hands could gain magnetism. She had no secondary abilities, required physical contact to magnetize the target, and the process was extremely slow. According to her, it would take half a day to magnetize a stone block one foot square.



Indeed, for the Witch Cooperation Association, this was not very useful; magnets were nothing new, and ships sailing between the fjord and the continent were all equipped with navigation needles with a pointing function. There were plenty of reference points on land, so one could quickly find their direction without such things. On the contrary, objects that were magnetized could cause trouble for everyone. For example, iron pots and utensils that were lightened by Hummingbird would inadvertently fly towards Miya, which led to Cara forbidding her from using her powers within the camp.



But for Roland, this silent and reticent girl was an invaluable treasure that had come knocking at his door.



This was also the reason he wanted to hum "Super star"—were there any more fitting lyrics than "You are the electricity, you are the light"?



Magnetism generates electricity, and electricity generates magnetism; this was knowledge well-known to any engineering student. He silently thanked Faraday, Gauss, Ampère, and Maxwell in his heart. With electricity, there would be light, and perhaps in no time at all, he would be able to showcase another miracle in his domain.



A witch who was forbidden to use her powers but still survived the demonic bite indicated that although she was introverted and had low self-esteem, her will was not weak. At least in her desire to survive, she was stronger than most people. Roland silently rejoiced that she had joined the Witch Cooperation Association for less than a year; otherwise, over the years, it was very likely that Cara would have buried her alive.



He made a sweeping motion with his pen, scheduling Miya's training for the next few days to focus on magnetizing various objects and determining the relationship between magic consumption and the strength of magnetism.

With these seven witches, Roland's witch lineup surged to twelve. After observing such a diverse group of samples, he had a general understanding of the manifestation of magic. The traditional division into combat and non-combat types didn't seem reasonable; he preferred to categorize them based on the characteristics of their abilities. Overall, the main abilities of the witches could be divided into three major categories.



The first category was self-enhancement. This type of ability was extremely rare; so far, only Scroll belonged to this category. Her ability, akin to a passive skill, was unaffected by the God's Punishment Stones. Even while wearing a God's Punishment Stone, she could still achieve eidetic memory.



The second category was summoning. Anna, Nightingale, Nana, Lightning, Wendy, Leaf, Soraya, Echo, and Lily all belonged to this large category. The characteristic of this type was that magic could take effect away from the caster—although this distance was limited to within five meters. The abilities of summoning-type witches were the most varied and were most affected by the God's Punishment Stones. As soon as they entered a magic-forbidden area, any effects produced by their magic would disappear. However, the outcomes produced by their abilities before being obstructed were permanent and irreversible.



The third category was enchantment, like Hummingbird and Miya. The method of magic application involved physical contact with the target, the transformation process was slow, and it consumed a significant amount of magic. It would also be interrupted by the God's Punishment Stones. However, once the transformation was complete, it became an inherent property of the object, still effective within a magic-forbidden zone. Enchantments were time-limited; their duration depended on the size of the object and the witch's own magical condition.



This was probably why the God's Punishment Stones couldn't eliminate the backlash of magic, he thought. The God's Punishment Stones didn't affect the gathering and flow of magic; they interfered with the process of magic transforming into abilities. Put simply, they targeted the customer front end rather than the backend data.



Roland put down his quill and rubbed his eyes. Regardless, it looked like he had plenty more work ahead of him.
