## Reminiscence
"Scram! Filthy beggar!"

Someone pushed her hard, but she remained unmoved, instead watching as the person stumbled back two steps.

The arrogance instantly vanished from his face, and after glaring at her fiercely, he slunk away.

Unperturbed, she continued moving through the crowd. Most people frowned and stepped aside upon seeing the woman in tattered clothes. In this manner, she slowly made her way to the inner city gate of the King's City of Graycastle.

The place was already bustling with people. Although the inner city didn't have traditional walls and gates, people had erected a symbolic gate here made of wooden bars and garlands. On both sides of the gate, a line of knights clad in full armor stood neatly, their exquisite armors reflecting a dazzling light in the sun. With hollow eagles spreading their wings on their shoulders and iris decorations hanging on their chests, the knights' handsome features drew shouts and squeals from a group of noble ladies.

Behind the knights, a uniform sea of red velvet capes trailed to the ground, appearing like a red barrier from a distance. It was these imposing and valiant knights who separated the crowd, leaving a wide pathway behind the gate.

Along the roadside, banners fluttered, with many long golden flags hanging from the top of the poles, giving a sense of solemnity and dignity. The flags were embroidered with various patterns, the most common of which were high towers and long spears. She knew that this pattern represented the royal family of Graycastle, who were also the organizers of today's ceremony.

Today was the coming-of-age ceremony for the Fifth Princess, Tilly Wimbledon.

The news had been widely publicized a week earlier and was known throughout the city. In addition to the local nobility of Graycastle, many delegations from other kingdoms had also arrived. They brought gifts and marriage proposals, hoping to win the favor of the Fifth Princess.



The church will also send a bishop to preside over the ceremony, which will be held at the Dawn Square in the city center. At that time, the royal family will distribute meat porridge and thick soup, which is also the reason why so many people are attracted.



But she did not come for the food.

Her target was the archbishop.

Surely, killing an archbishop in broad daylight in the capital would be a disgrace to the church, a severe blow to their dignity. This sweet taste of revenge always excited her. She touched her chest, where she hid a stolen dagger. Although of poor quality, it was enough to kill a mortal.



Suddenly, a thunderous cheer erupted from the crowd, interrupting her thoughts. She looked towards the inner city area, where the Kingdom's Knights' Order was slowly advancing in well-ordered rows. The knights at the front were dressed in shining armor, followed by capes with red backgrounds and golden edges, like clusters of leaping flames.



Behind the knights was a carriage pulled side by side by four fine horses, its sides carved with the Greycastle royal crest, and the wheels and chassis were gilded. Red triangular flags fluttered on the top of the carriage, and silk satin embroidered with gold thread hung from the four corners of the carriage. At a glance, the entire procession looked like a moving sea of gold.



The crowd moved with the procession towards Dawn Square, and she mingled among them, entering the outskirts of the square—the inner circle had been cordoned off by the guards, and only nobles could watch the ceremony up close. She estimated that it would only take her a few moments to rush over; once the archbishop stepped onto the square, he would not be able to escape from her hands.



The royal offspring got off the carriage one after another. The ones slowly walking up to the central stage were probably the five children of King Wimbledon III.



Among these people, she saw Princess Tilly Wimbledon.



Without a doubt, the Fifth Princess was today's protagonist—her eyes shone with a lively light, as transparent as gems; her neat, side-parted bangs paired with refreshing gray hair, without any adornment; her appearance was particularly outstanding among her siblings; the pattern on her dress was not complicated, and it matched her temperament perfectly. And most incredibly, she cast her gaze over the crowd, directly onto her. Then, like giving a greeting, she nodded slightly, a smile appearing at the corner of her mouth.

This was definitely not an illusion. In that moment, she felt the same sensation—an incredibly intimate feeling, as if they were friends who had known each other for many years, warm and sweet. It did not come from a recognition of blood, status, or position, but from... a resonance of magic.

Unconsciously, she loosened her grip on the knife handle, quietly watching the woman on the stage.

After the ceremony, two guards found her, intending to take her into the palace.

Had she any intention to refuse, the guards would not have been able to stop her. But she asked no questions and followed the two men into the inner city, eventually entering the grand palace through a side path.

In a secret room of the palace, she stood before the Fifth Princess.

"...I see."

"What a tragic story, so this is how you ended up in Graycastle. Don't worry, you won't have to wander anymore. From now on, stay by my side."



"I will give you a good makeover, ensuring that they will never recognize you again."

"I have inquired about it. The monastery was destroyed by a great fire, all the children are missing. All that remains of the building now is a pile of ruins and ashes."

"Did you have a name before?"

"If that's the case, let's call you Ashes."

...

Ashes opened her eyes, and the first thing she saw was Maggie's face.

Maggie blinked and then hugged her tightly, "You're finally awake, coo!"

She tried to move her fingers. There was no weakness or numbness as she had anticipated, and there was no sharp pain coming from her waist.

"How long was I unconscious?"



"In the afternoon," Maggie said, "Nana mentioned that as long as you were healed, you could be woken up at any time. However, your body would be very tired at that point, and it's better to let nature take its course and rest for a while. Waking up after a good sleep helps a lot with energy recovery."



Ashes patted Maggie's head, slowly sat up from the bed, lifted her clothes, and found her abdomen intact. The huge wound seemed like a nightmare that dissipated into nothingness upon waking.



"How did she... treat me?"



"I guess you wouldn't want to know," Maggie pursed her lips, but seeing Ashes' insistent look, she continued, "They collected the... um, parts of you that were scattered, put them back into your stomach, and then Nana used her magic to restore them to their original state—Lightning said that the more parts they collected, the quicker she could heal you. If a limb was completely missing, she wouldn't be able to make it grow back."



Ashes felt goosebumps, "So the mud and bits of grass that got on me too..."



"After the wound healed, the dirt was expelled to the outside. Her ability seems to distinguish what parts are useful and what are not."



She breathed a sigh of relief, got out of bed, and tried to feel the strength in her body. Just like Nana had said, after waking up, she didn’t feel weak at all; on the contrary, she felt stronger than before.



Ashes put on her black robe, glanced at the sky outside the window, and walked toward the door.



"Where are you going?" Maggie asked.



"Greetings to His Highness, the Prince," she said without turning her head.
