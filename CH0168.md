## Reminiscence
"Get lost! Filthy beggar!"

Someone pushed her hard, but she remained unmoved, instead watching as the person staggered back two steps.

The arrogance instantly vanished from his face, and after glaring at her fiercely, he skulked away.

She was unfazed and continued to move through the crowd. As people saw the woman in tattered clothes, most of them frowned and steered clear of her. In this manner, she slowly made her way to the inner city gates of Greycastle's capital.

The place was packed with people. Although the inner city area didn't have traditional walls and gates, people had erected a symbolic gate made of wooden bars and garlands. Flanking the gate stood a row of warriors in full armor, their exquisite armor reflecting the dazzling sunlight. The hollow eagle-shaped pauldrons on their shoulders and the iris decorations hanging on their chests, combined with the handsome faces of the warriors, elicited squeals from a group of wealthy young ladies.

Behind the warriors, uniform red velvet capes trailed all the way to the ground, forming what seemed like a red barrier from afar. It was these handsome and valiant warriors who divided the crowd, leaving a wide path several yards across behind the gate.

Flags fluttered along the side of the path, with many long, golden banners hanging from the tops of the poles, giving off a solemn and grand feeling. The banners were embroidered with various patterns, the most common of which were high towers and long spears. She knew that this pattern represented the Greycastle royal family and was also the symbol of today's ceremony.

Today was the coming-of-age ceremony of Princess Tilly Wimbledon.

The event had been publicized a week in advance and was well-known throughout the city. Not only had Greycastle's local nobility been informed, but delegations from other kingdoms had also arrived in abundance. They brought gifts and marriage proposals, hoping to win the favor of Princess Tilly.



The Church would also send a bishop to preside over the grand ceremony, which would be held in the central Dawn Square. At that time, the royal family would distribute meat porridge and thick soup, which was also the reason why so many people were attracted.

But she was not here for the food.

Her target was the archbishop.

She supposed that killing an archbishop in broad daylight in the capital would surely be a disgrace to the Church and a great blow to their authority. The sweet taste of revenge always excited her. She touched her chest, where a stolen dagger was hidden. Although it was of poor quality, it was enough to kill a mortal.

Suddenly, a thunderous cheer erupted from the crowd, interrupting her thoughts. She looked towards the inner city area, where the Knights of the Kingdom were marching in neat formation, slowly approaching. The knights at the front were dressed in shining armor, followed by cloaks with red backgrounds and gold edges, fluttering like clusters of leaping flames.

Behind the knights was a carriage drawn by four magnificent horses, with the emblem of the Greycastle royal family carved on its side, and its wheels and frame were plated in gold. Fluttering red pennants adorned the top, and silk satin embroidered with golden threads hung from the four corners of the carriage. At a glance, the entire procession resembled a moving golden sea.

The crowd moved with the procession towards Dawn Square, and she mingled among them, entering the outskirts of the square—the inner circle was cordoned off by guards, and only nobles could watch the ceremony up close. She estimated that it would take her only a few moments to rush over; as soon as the archbishop stepped onto the square, he would not be able to escape her.

The royal offspring descended from the carriages one by one. The one who slowly ascended the central stage was probably Wimbledon III's five children.

Among these people, she saw the fifth princess, Tilly Wimbledon.



Without a doubt, the Fifth Princess was the protagonist of the day—her eyes sparkled with an agile light, as transparent as gems; her simple side-parted bangs matched with her refreshing gray hair, unadorned; her features stood out distinctly among her siblings; the pattern on her dress was not complicated, complementing her temperament just right. And the most incredible thing was, she managed to look past the layers of crowd, directly at herself. Then, as if to greet her, she nodded slightly, a smile appearing at the corners of her mouth.

This was definitely not an illusion, in the blink of an eye, she felt the same sentiment—a feeling of great familiarity, as if they were friends who had known each other for many years, tender and sweet. It did not come from recognition of blood, status, or position, but from... a resonance of magic.

Without realizing it, she let go of the tightly gripped knife handle and quietly watched the woman on the stage.

After the ceremony, two guards found her, intending to take her into the palace.

If she had any intention to refuse, the guards wouldn't have been able to stop her. But she didn't ask any questions and followed the two men into the inner city, eventually entering the magnificent palace through a side path.

In a secret room of the palace, she stood before the Fifth Princess.

"…I see."

"What a tragic story, so this is how you ended up in Greycastle."

"Don't worry, you won't have to wander anymore. From now on, stay by my side."



"I will give you a good makeover, so they won't be able to recognize you again."

"I have inquired about it, the monastery was destroyed by a great fire, and all the children are missing. The whole building is now nothing but ruins and ashes."

"Did you have a name before?"

"Since that is the case, let's call you Ashes."

...

Ashes opened her eyes, and the first thing she saw was Maggie's face.

Maggie blinked and then hugged her tightly, "You've finally woken up, coo!"

She tried to move her fingers and felt neither the weakness nor numbness she had expected, and there was no sharp pain coming from her waist.

"How long was I unconscious?"



"In the afternoon," Maggie said, "Nana mentioned that you could be woken up anytime after being healed. But at that time, the body will be very tired, so it's better to let nature take its course and rest for a while. Waking up after a good sleep is much better for energy recovery."

Ashes patted Maggie's head, slowly sat up from the bed, lifted her clothes, and saw that her abdomen was intact. The huge wound was like a nightmare, disappearing into nothingness upon awakening.

"How did she... treat me?"

"I guess you wouldn't want to know," Maggie said with a grimace, but seeing the persistent look in Ashes' eyes, she continued, "They collected your... uh, scattered parts, stuffed them back into your belly, and then Nana used magic to restore them to their original state—according to Lightning, the more parts they collected, the faster her healing. If a limb is completely missing, she can't make it grow back."

Ashes felt goosebumps rise, "So the mud and grass clippings that got on me..."

"After the wound healed, the dirt was pushed out. Her ability seems to be able to distinguish what parts are useful and what are not."

She breathed a sigh of relief, turned over to get out of bed, and tried to feel the strength in her body. Just like Nana said, after waking up, she did not feel weak at all; on the contrary, she felt stronger than before.

Ashes put on her black robe, glanced at the sky outside the window, and walked toward the door.

"Where are you going?" Maggie asked.



"Greetings to His Royal Highness," she said without turning her head.
