## Battle of Hermes (Part 1)
...

Icicle rain fluttered down, diluting the stench of blood within the Holy City. Ashes held her greatsword, panting heavily.

This was not her first time participating in the defense of the Hermes Plateau, but she had never imagined that the New Holy City might also fall one day.

The walls were completely finished.

Ashes had never seen such terrifying monsters before. Huge insect-like hybrid beasts burst forth from underground, their bodies clinging to the ice cliffs, their bony claws embedding into the wall like hooks, climbing step by step to the top of the city wall, while their bodies were still not fully exposed above ground.

If it were just their enormous size, that would be one thing, but to everyone's surprise, the monsters opened their gaping maws and spat out large piles of mixed Demonic Beasts, causing chaos to erupt on the city walls.

What was once an orderly troop was now scattered by the impact of the Demonic Beasts. Ashes watched helplessly as one after another, her comrades were swallowed by the beasts, unable to do anything as warm human blood mixed with the black blood of the monsters, flowing along the cracks of the slate ground.

With the sound of the retreat horn, the trebuchets installed in the Holy City were also activated, hurling granite boulders half the height of a man from the sky, completely disregarding the fact that there were still many of their own and the Kingdom's army on the city walls.

Ashes only remembered that a huge boulder happened to hit Captain Dietrich at her side. After she got up from the ground, she saw that he had been embedded into the cracked and indented slates along with his armor, his body like a wrinkled parchment, his intestines spilling out from the cracks in his abdomen, with steaming hot blood pooling beneath him, forming a small puddle.



If she hadn't leaped forward before the stone hit the ground, her fate would probably have been the same as his, she thought.

As for how she managed to break out of the encirclement and retreat under the city wall, Alethea couldn't remember clearly. Screams and curses were everywhere, everyone was swinging their weapons, slashing wildly, and it was uncertain whether they were fighting against demonic beasts or slaughtering their own comrades.

Of the Judgment Army, which had over a hundred people, only twelve, including herself, survived.

"What do we do next, Captain!"

"Captain Alethea!"

Alethea suddenly came back to her senses; it was true, according to the rules of the Judgment Army, if the captain fell in battle, the vice-captain should take over the position of captain and continue to lead the troops in combat.

She bit her lip hard until a metallic taste filled her mouth, "We go to the north gate of the Holy City. If the demonic beasts want to attack New Holy City, they must pass through there." This order meant giving up the residential area between the city wall and the inner city, but she had no other choice; there was no place more important than the church's core—Hermes Cathedral.

And there was one more thing she didn't say out loud: if the glacier cliffs couldn't stop these creatures, what could she and the remaining eleven people do?

Perhaps today was the day she would give her life for the kingdom of heaven, she prayed silently, and at the same time shouted, "The Judgment Army never surrenders! Let's move out!"



"The Judgement Army never gives up!" the others shouted in unison.



The twelve formed a column and jogged towards the North Gate; the sounds of fighting from the city walls gradually weakened until they disappeared into the sound of the wind and rain.



Upon reaching the North Gate, Alethea saw that quite a number of the Judgement Army had already gathered in front of the drawbridge. It seemed that everyone had the same thought, which made her feel slightly better.



But at this critical moment, the drawbridge was down. Alethea frowned, walked up to a handsome warrior dressed in the standard red robe of a Chief Judge, and saluted with a fist, "Chief Judge, I am Captain Alethea Quinn of the Judgement Army Vanguard Camp's Fourth Squad!"



"I am Tucker Thor, the person in charge of the defense of the North Gate. You've worked hard," the man nodded, "We have set up a first-aid station behind the North Gate. If there are any injured in your squad, you can send them over."



"Sir, I don't understand. Why don't we raise the drawbridge at this time? The demonic beasts from the city walls could swarm in at any moment, and we must ensure the inner city is not lost."



"Keep calm, Captain. I know you and your squad are not afraid of sacrifice, but senseless sacrifice is meaningless. The Church has not yet reached its last moment," he extended his hand to wipe the rain off his forehead, "Go to the assembly area and stand by. If you've run out of Warmth Pills, remember to ask the quartermaster for more."



Only after the Chief Judge said this did Alethea realize that she was severely cold. After breaking away from the battlefield, the sweat on her body mixed with the icy rain, almost freezing her entire body in the cold. The piercing cold wind blew in her face, making her shiver uncontrollably.



She took out the sheepskin pouch from her inner pocket and shook it into her palm, but only a sticky liquid flowed out. It seemed that she had accidentally crushed the pills during the fight. She sighed, looked up, and found a brown-red Warmth Pill being handed to her.



"Eat mine first," Talc Tor smiled at her. "You can return it to me later."

Alesia took the meatball without any courtesy, bit it, and swallowed it down. "Maybe we won't have another chance to eat this thing again."

"Yeah, that wouldn't be so bad," Talc actually nodded in agreement. "This thing is really disgusting."

As soon as the words left her mouth, a strong stench of fishiness rushed up from Alesia's stomach. Even the battlefield, strewn with corpses, would not emit such a nauseating odor. She felt that what she had swallowed was not a pill, but a lump of long-rotted flesh and blood. An unbearable sour and numb sensation surged from her abdomen throughout her body. The coldness suddenly receded, followed by a hot stream that flowed through her veins. Her body temperature gradually returned, and the sweat that had frozen began to slide down again. Wisps of white vapor rose from the top of her head, and her numb toes regained sensation.



"But not today," seeing her swallow the chill pill, the Chief Inquisitor waved his hand. "The God's Punishment Army is coming from the Cathedral, and the demonic beasts cannot pass the North Gate. Take your men to the rally point. Remember to check their pills. Don't end up like you, realizing they're gone when it's time to use them."

The God's Punishment Army, the most elite force in the hands of the Church! Alesia had heard of them for a long time but had never seen them with her own eyes. But even if the God's Punishment Army was as powerful as the rumors suggested, they were still human after all. No matter how they trained their bodies, they couldn't possibly easily defeat a large group of mixed demonic beasts.



But since the Chief Inquisitor had said so, she had no choice but to leave the North Gate with her eleven team members and move towards the assembly point to the west.

Hundreds of retreating Inquisitorial Army soldiers had already gathered here. They stood in the rain in groups of three or two, letting the rain run down their faces; some even sat directly on the ground, looking utterly listless. Only a small portion of them were still in neat rows, ready for any enemy that might appear at any moment.

If it had been a few days earlier, Alesia would have stood up and scolded them, but now, she was just as bewildered. To build this New Holy City, countless kinsmen had been buried here. It could be said that every brick and tile here was infused with the blood of the believers and the Inquisitorial Army. The Bishop often said that occupying Hermes meant possessing the divine kingdom on earth.



However, today, the Divine Kingdom seemed on the verge of falling into the claws of devils.

"The demonic beasts are coming!" someone shouted. "Prepare to meet the enemy!"

Ashes mustered her spirits, raised her greatsword, and gazed at the rapidly approaching shadow in the sky, calling out loudly, "For Hermes!"

"—For the New Holy City!"
