## New Drama
"Class is dismissed for today."

"Goodbye, Teacher." The little girls chorused.

Irene closed the textbook, watching as the children left the classroom—this place was originally a noble's residence, but after the Months of Demons, it was requisitioned by the lord and has now been converted into an academy. Both the upper and lower floors had their small rooms' partition walls knocked through, creating several larger rooms that could accommodate four to six batches of apprentices at a time, referred to as 'classes' according to the textbook. During the day, the classes were mostly filled with children, while at night, they were for adults.



She had thought that her application to become a teacher would take a long time to reach the City Hall, but to her surprise, after Philip reported the matter, she received approval the very next day. Then came the trip to the City Hall to register her identity, collect the textbooks, and receive a class schedule.



The students she was responsible for teaching were mostly the children of the townspeople. To get these little troublemakers to listen attentively, she had put in a lot of effort. There was even a chapter in the textbook specifically about how to maintain classroom discipline, and the strategies it outlined were eye-opening for her. Besides traditional verbal criticism and caning, there were methods like awarding honors, dividing into groups, appointing group leaders and class monitors, and having them manage themselves, among others.



The person who wrote this textbook must have been an elder who had studied teaching methods for many years to have considered everything so thoroughly, right?



Stepping out of the academy, Irene immediately spotted the knight waiting for her at the door, Philip Eltek.



He was no longer in shining armor, holding a shield emblazoned with a lion's crest and a long sword, but he was still as handsome as ever. Dressed in a simple leather outfit, it highlighted his tall figure, and with his well-defined features, even empty-handed, he was the Dawn Light she remembered.



After giving him a hug, Irene noticed that there was something off about Philip's expression.



"What's the matter?" she asked.

"..." He hesitated, "His Highness the Prince has invited us to enjoy tea at the palace this afternoon."

Irene was startled, "Us?" She immediately guessed what he was worried about, patted his back, and shook her head, "His Highness has never seen me, how could he possibly treat me the way the Duke did... Besides, aren't you with me?"

"Yes," Philip nodded, "This time, I will protect you."



In the afternoon, Irene dressed simply, choosing an appropriate long dress, and went with her husband to the lord's castle.



They were led into the drawing room by the guards, and before long, a grey-haired man appeared at the doorway. Without a doubt, he was the Western Region's Lord, Prince Roland Wimbledon. Accompanying him was a lady, probably over thirty years of age, whose demeanor was calm and capable, and from her charming features, it was clear she must have been a remarkable beauty in her youth. The couple quickly stood up and bowed.



"Welcome, Mr. and Mrs. Eltek," Roland took his seat at the head of the table, "All these are court delicacies. Please feel free to enjoy them without restraint."



"Thank you for your invitation. It is an honor to be here for tea," Philip replied with noble etiquette.



"This lady is called Scroll, and she is also the head of the education department in the City Hall. I believe you may have already met her."



"Indeed," he nodded toward the scroll as a sign of respect, "I have yet to thank you. Without your permission, Irene would not have become a teacher so quickly."

It turned out she had helped herself, Irene thought, casting a grateful smile at her.

After chatting casually for a while, Philip tentatively asked, "May I know why Your Highness has summoned us here?"

"It's about education," Roland paused for a moment, looking toward Irene, "I heard that you used to work at the Stronghold Theater, were you an actress?"

"Uh..." Irene hadn't expected the prince to ask her such a question, "I've only performed formally once."

"I see. I plan to put on a play every weekend in the town square," the prince said directly, "We have the script, playwright, and director all ready, the only thing missing is the cast. You don't have many classes, and you have experience in drama, so I'd like you to play the lead role in this play. Of course, there will be additional pay. Would you be willing?"

"..." Irene looked at the prince in disbelief, and after confirming that he was not joking, she nodded excitedly, "Your Highness, I would be honored!"

Performing on stage had always been her dream, and after leaving the Longsong Theater, she knew she might never have the chance to act in a play again. In front of Philip, she showed no regret, only hiding her wishes deep in her heart. She had not expected that she would have the opportunity to return to the stage one day.

"These plays are performed for the masses, so the requirements are not high, just clearly telling the story is enough. Do you have such friends at Longsong Stronghold—those who have a certain understanding of drama and would like to perform but have no opportunity? If so, you can write them a letter, telling them that in Border Town, there are performances every weekend with pay equal to that of the Stronghold Theater."



"Can they also participate? I know quite a few!" Irene said, overjoyed. "I'll write to them as soon as I get back. If they can get the chance to perform, I think they'll be very willing to make the trip to the town!"



"Very good," Roland passed over three booklets, "These are the scripts, with numbers on them. Your performances will start from the first story. They are all adapted from books and are very close to the life of the common people. You can take them back to read carefully. If there is anything you don't understand, just ask Scroll about it."



"Yes, Your Highness! Thank you!" Irene bowed.



...



"Is this really okay?" Scroll asked, "Those stories are all your own ideas."



"What does it matter? In their eyes, a prince could never write something so vulgar," Roland stretched lazily, "And without your final editing and polishing, the scripts would never be finished in such a short time."



"I don't think the stories are vulgar at all," she shook her head, "Although I don't know why you are so aware of these things, they are all events that happen around the people, touching and thought-provoking. The performance will definitely be very popular."



Of course, they will be popular, Roland thought. The first two scripts were adapted from 'Cinderella' and 'The Rooster Crows at Midnight', both time-tested by the masses. The former depicted a touching romance between the commoners and the royal family, while the latter was about the struggle of the lower class against the evil landlords. Of course, they had been locally adapted, like the witch in Cinderella turned into a witch, and the landlord in The Rooster Crows at Midnight turned into a fierce little noble. Roland planned to release the third work, 'The Diary of a Witch', after the first two plays had a profound impact, which was where his real intention lay.



This was a script entirely conceived by him, telling the story of three children who became witches but each took a completely different path. He didn't directly mention the Church, but instead focused on the fates of these three individuals: one child was abandoned by her parents, another was used as a tool, and the last one was fortunate enough that her parents still loved her deeply and gave their lives to protect her. In the end, by a twist of fate, the three of them came together, overcame the enemies who wanted them dead, and just like ordinary people, they found their own happiness.



Roland planned to produce "The Witch Diaries" as a series, to reshape the values of the outsiders. In the twists and heartfelt drama, he aimed to plant the notion that anyone's loved ones could become a witch, and that they were not evil beings.
