## New Drama
"Class is over for today," I announced.

"Goodbye, teacher," the little girls chorused in unison.

Closing the textbook, I watched the children leave the classroom—a residence that once belonged to a noble family but was requisitioned by the lord after the Evil Months, now transformed into an academy. By knocking down the dividing walls of the small rooms on both floors, several larger rooms were created, each able to accommodate four to six groups of apprentices. According to the textbooks, these were called 'classes.' During the day, the classes were filled with children, and at night, with adults.



I had thought it would take a long time for my application to become a teacher to reach the city hall, but to my surprise, after Phyllis reported the matter, I received permission the very next day. Then came registering my identity at city hall, receiving the textbooks, and getting a class schedule.



My charges were mainly the children of the townsfolk. To get these little troublemakers to listen attentively, I had to put in a lot of effort. There was even a chapter in the textbook specifically on how to maintain classroom discipline, with strategies that were eye-opening for me. Beyond the traditional verbal reprimands and cane punishment, there were also methods like awarding merits, forming groups, appointing group leaders and class monitors, and letting them manage each other.



The person who wrote this textbook must have been an elder who had studied teaching for many years to have considered all these aspects, right?



Stepping out of the academy, I immediately saw the knight waiting for me at the door, Phyllin Silt.

He was no longer in shining armor, holding a shield emblazoned with a lion crest and a longsword, but he remained exceedingly handsome. His simple leather attire accentuated his tall figure and, coupled with his distinct facial features, he was the same Dawnlight I remembered, even with empty hands.



After giving him a hug, I noticed something was off with Phyllin's expression.



"What's the matter?" she asked.

"..." He hesitated, "Prince His Highness has invited us to the royal palace for tea this afternoon."

Irene was taken aback, "Us?" She immediately guessed what he was worried about, patted his back, and shook her head, "The Prince His Highness has never seen me, how could he possibly treat me the way the duke did... Besides, aren't you with me?"

"Yes," Phyllis nodded, "This time, I will protect you."

In the afternoon, Irene dressed simply, choosing an appropriate long dress, and went to the lord's castle with her husband.

Led by the guards into the parlor, they did not wait long before a gray-haired man appeared at the doorway. Without a doubt, he was the lord of the Western Territory, Prince Roland Wimbledon. A lady accompanied him, seemingly over thirty, her demeanor steady and competent, and from her charming features, it was evident she must have been a remarkable beauty in her youth. The couple quickly rose to their feet and bowed.

"Welcome, Mr. and Mrs. Seilt," Roland seated himself at the head of the table, "Please enjoy the court delicacies on the table, there is no need to be reserved."

"Thank you for your invitation, it is my honor to be here for tea," Phyllis replied with noble etiquette.

"This lady is Scroll, also the head of the Municipal Hall's Education Department, I think you may have already met her."



"Indeed," he nodded toward the scrolls, paying them respect, "I have yet to thank you. Without your permission, Irene would not have become a teacher so quickly."

It turns out she had helped herself, Irene thought, sending a grateful smile her way.

After chatting idly for a while, Phyllis tentatively asked, "May I know why Your Highness has summoned us here?"

"It's about education," Roland paused, looking towards Irene, "I heard you used to work at the fortress theater. Were you an actress?"

"Uh..." Irene did not expect the prince to ask her such a question, "I've only performed formally once."

"I see. I plan to stage a play every weekend in the town square," the prince said directly, "We have the script, the playwright, and the director, but we're lacking performers. You don't have many classes, and you have experience with drama, so I'd like you to take the leading role in the play. Of course, there will be extra pay. Are you willing?"

"..." Irene looked at His Highness in disbelief, and after confirming he wasn't joking, she nodded excitedly, "Respected Your Highness, I am willing!"

Performing on stage had always been her wish. After leaving the Longsong Theater, she knew she might never have the chance to perform in a play again. Facing Phyllis, she showed no regret, just keeping her wishes in her heart. Unexpectedly, she would have the chance to return to the stage one day.

"These plays are for the public, so the requirements are not high; as long as the story is clearly told. Did you have such friends at the Longsong fortress—those with a certain understanding of drama, who wanted to be on stage but never had the opportunity? If so, you can write them a letter, telling them that in Border Town, there are performances every weekend, with pay the same as at the fortress theater."



"They can come too? I know quite a few!" Irene exclaimed with joy, "I'll write to them when I get back. If they can get the chance to perform, I think they'd be delighted to make the trip to the town!"



"Very well," Roland passed over three booklets, "Here are the scripts, numbered. Your performances will start with the first story. They are adapted from books and are very much in line with the lives of ordinary people. You can take them back and read them carefully. If there's anything you don't understand, ask Scroll about it."



"Yes, Your Highness! Thank you!" Irene bowed.



...



"Is this really okay?" Scroll asked, "Those stories are all your own creations."



"What does it matter? In their eyes, a prince couldn't possibly write something so vulgar," Roland stretched lazily, "Besides, without your final editing and polishing, the scripts couldn't be completed in such a short time."



"I don't think the stories are vulgar at all," she shook her head, "Although I don't know why you're so familiar with these matters, they are things happening around the people, touching and thought-provoking. The performances will definitely be very popular."



Of course they will be popular, Roland thought. The first two scripts were adapted from "Cinderella" and "The Cry at Midnight," both of which had been tested by the masses. The former depicted a touching love story between the commoners and the royal family, while the latter was about the lower class people's rebellion against the unscrupulous landlords. Of course, they had been localized: the witch in Cinderella became a witch, and the landlord in The Cry at Midnight turned into a vicious young noble. Roland planned to release the third piece, "The Witch Diaries," after the first two plays had made a deep impact—it was where his true intentions lay.



It was a script entirely of his own design, telling the story of three children who became witches, each taking a completely different path. He did not mention the Church directly, but instead focused on the fateful journey of these three: one child was abandoned by her parents, another was used as a tool, and the last, a fortunate one, was still deeply loved by her parents, who sacrificed their lives to protect her. In the end, by a twist of fate, the three came together, overcame the enemies who sought their deaths, and achieved happiness like ordinary people.



Roland planned to produce "The Witch Diaries" as a series to reshape the values of the outsiders. In the twists and turns of the touching drama, he intended to plant the idea that anyone's loved ones could become a witch, and that they were not evil beings.
