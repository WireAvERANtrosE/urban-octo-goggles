## Militia
"Is this the group you've brought?" Roland looked at the ragged commoners before him, the urge to turn around and leave rising in his heart.

"Your Highness, these were selected according to your requirements," Carter counted on his fingers, "male, non-criminals, aged eighteen or above, under forty, physically complete... I checked them carefully."

Well, he knew he couldn't have too many expectations. After all, the productivity of this world was so low, having enough to eat was a difficult task, let alone decent clothes. As a prince, he overlooked this fact, but once he left the castle, he could see scantily clad beggars everywhere. In fact, even in the capital, Greycastle, there would be professionals who collected corpses - their job was to incinerate the bodies of the starved that had collapsed on the streets.

So what was the combat mode of this world? Roland closed his eyes and carefully recalled, well... it was probably a bit more advanced than gang fights. Generally, when a lord decided to wage war (or a fight - Roland didn't think these battles could be associated with the word 'war'), he would summon the vassal nobles under his jurisdiction. These nobles would then gather even lower-ranking nobles within their territory, such as the duke summoning his earls, the earls summoning viscounts and barons, and so on.

Most of these nobles had a group of knights and mercenaries as their personal force. They were the main force in battles, typically fully armored with excellent weapons. At the same time, they would also conscript commoners and peasants to assist in the fight - who were actually used to transport supplies and serve as cannon fodder at the front lines. The most casualties in battle were these cannon fodders, and as long as nobles didn't die on the battlefield, they would generally be captured and treated well in exchange for ransom.

Roland naturally didn't expect the nobles of Border Town to help him in battle. In fact, they had nothing to do with Border Town, most of them were barons granted by the Lord of Longsong Stronghold, and their territories were also under the jurisdiction of the stronghold.

A force completely composed of commoners was a very imaginative thing in this era. They were ignorant, illiterate, couldn't understand commands, and hadn't undergone professional combat training. How could they compete with knights who had been practicing swordsmanship since they were ten?

Carter leaned closer to Roland, whispering, "Your Highness, this is simply unfeasible. Look at them, which one can even hold a sword? They would probably scatter at the sight of demonic beasts, which would destabilize our defense line. I suggest hiring professional mercenaries from Willow Town or other places to guard the city walls. These people can just do some miscellaneous tasks."

"No, I'll use them," Roland refused. He had no good impression of mercenaries who worked for money. Besides, building an army was not just to deal with demonic beasts. Throughout history, a strong and resilient team must come from the people, whether it's a feudal army, a modern army, or a contemporary army, this rule has been verified countless times.



"Alright, you're the boss," the knight shrugged, "Shall I begin training them in swordplay tomorrow? Though it might not be very useful..."

"Swordplay? No, start with them lining up and running—" Roland suddenly realized that the Chief Knight might not have experienced these training sessions himself, so he had to change his words, "Call over the hunter we found last time, and you can watch how I do it first."

...

Fana experienced more incredulity today than he had in the previous twenty years combined.

He had actually seen the fourth prince of the kingdom—Roland Wimbledon up close. The prince had walked past him and even smiled at him. Good heavens, was the prince drunk?

Three days ago, when the fourth prince gave a speech in the square, he knew that this winter would be different from the past. They would not go to the Longsong Fortress, but would spend the long winter here. He didn't understand much of what the prince said, but he wholeheartedly agreed with this decision. Fana's younger brother had died in the slums of the fortress two years ago. There was no food supply for a whole month. He shared some black bread with his brother, which he bought with a few copper coins he earned from unloading goods at the dock. But that winter was too cold. The shanty in the slum was drafty everywhere. They couldn't even keep warm with the little they had to eat. His brother never woke up after falling ill and fainting.

In Border Town, at least he had a mud-brick house and did not need to fear the heavy snow that fell for days on end. He also saw the docks filled with wheat that was being transported from elsewhere, which was being moved into the castle in batches. Therefore, as soon as Fana heard about the fourth prince recruiting militia, he rushed over immediately.

Of course, the reason that tempted him to give up his stone-breaking job and rush to enlist was the monthly salary of as high as ten Silver Royals. This was on par with a skilled bricklayer! He was not young anymore. By next spring, he planned to marry Cheryl, the tavern maid, as his wife. How could he not save more money now?

As for what the militia had to do, as mentioned in the announcement, he did not pay any attention. After all, they would either serve the noblemen or assist the patrolling soldiers, but they surely wouldn't be asked to climb the city walls and confront the frenzied demonic beasts.



The screening process was quite strict, and the gaze of the shiningly armored knight made Van'er somewhat fearful. Luckily, his relatively sturdy physique passed the inspection, while many frail fellows were picked out by the knight from the line. In the end, only about a hundred of the respondents remained.



What Van'er never expected was that their trainer would be the Prince himself!



Those who passed were taken to the meadow west of Border Town, with the under-construction city wall behind them and the endless Hidden Forest in front of them. 



The Prince ordered everyone to line up and then went off to rest on the side. It had just rained a few days ago, the ground was still damp mud, and water seeped into the soles of their feet through the cracks in their shoes, making Van'er feel uncomfortable all over. Not to mention the posture required by the Prince was unusual, hands had to be vertically attached to both sides of the thighs, and the spine had to be kept straight.



Van'er felt exhausted after just a quarter of an hour, this was even more tiring than breaking stones with a hammer. But he gritted his teeth and persevered. Because the Prince had said before, whoever moves would lose an egg at lunch. My God, he hasn't tasted an egg for a long time. Obviously, everyone around him thought the same, although they were shaky, most of them held on. 



Not until the Prince announced a break did Van'er realize that he was already sweating, and the entire standing time was not long, at most half an hour. Those who did not persist to the end regretted it, as if they saw a round egg drifting away from them.



But Van'er didn't quite understand, what use was this training? Could standing help carry more bags of dry food?



If it wasn't for the respected Prince training them, he would have complained long ago.



Unexpectedly, the second command announced by the Prince after a short break was even more bizarre. He required everyone to line up again, this time, if everyone remained still, an extra egg would be added to lunch. If anyone gave up, everyone would lose the chance to get the extra egg.



Van'er heard the sound of someone swallowing saliva. 

Damn it, was this some kind of trick popular among the noble class of the kingdom? Using a carrot on a stick to make fools of everyone, he was no dumb ass!

...But what if, just what if everyone could actually do it, wouldn't that mean there would be two eggs to eat later?

This was a temptation straight from the devil, Van'er wiped the saliva from the corner of his mouth. For the eggs, he would give it his all!
