## Militia
"Is this the group of people you've brought to me?" Roland looked at the ragged-dressed civilians before him, feeling an urge to turn around and leave.



"Your Highness, these are selected according to your requirements," Carter counted on his fingers, "male, non-criminals, over eighteen, under forty, physically intact... I've checked them thoroughly."



Well, he knew he shouldn't have held too many expectations. After all, in a world where productivity is so low, even getting enough to eat is difficult, so it's normal to be poorly dressed. His treatment as a prince made him overlook this fact; once he stepped out of the castle, he would see refugees everywhere, barely clothed, begging for a living. In fact, even in the capital, there was the occupation of corpse collectors—whose job was to drag away the bodies of those who starved to death on the streets every day and cremate them.



So, what exactly was the mode of combat in this world? Roland closed his eyes and carefully recalled it, hmm... probably just a notch above a gang fight. Generally speaking, when a lord decides to wage war (or a brawl—Roland didn't think such fighting deserved to be called a war), he would summon the vassal nobles within his territory, who would then summon their own lower-ranking vassal nobles, like dukes summoning their counts, counts summoning their viscounts and barons, and so on.



Most of these nobles had a group of knights and mercenaries as their personal forces; they were the main combatants, usually well-armored and well-armed. At the same time, they would also conscript civilians and peasants from their lands to fight alongside them—actually just to transport food and fodder, and to be the first to rush to the front lines when cannon fodder was needed to fill the gaps. The heaviest casualties in battle were always these cannon fodder; in feudal conflicts, as long as one didn't die on the battlefield, they would usually be captured and treated well in exchange for ransom.



Naturally, Roland didn't expect the few nobles in Border Town to help him fight. In fact, they had nothing to do with Border Town at all; most of them were barons granted fiefs by the lord of Longsong Stronghold, with their territories also within the stronghold's jurisdiction.



An army composed entirely of civilians was an extremely imaginative thing in this era. They were foolish and ignorant, unable to read documents, unable to understand orders, and had no professional combat training; how could they compare to knights who had been training with swords since the age of ten?



Carter approached Roland and whispered, "Your Highness, this is not feasible. Look at them, which one of them can even hold a sword? If they encounter demonic beasts, I'm afraid they will scatter at once, which might instead destabilize our defenses. I suggest hiring professional mercenaries from Willow Town or somewhere else to guard the walls, and leave these people to do some menial tasks."



"No, I'll use them," Roland refused. He had no good feelings for those mercenaries who worked only for money. Moreover, he wasn't building an army just to deal with demonic beasts—history has shown time and again that a strong and vibrant force must come from the people, whether it was a feudal army, a modern army, or a contemporary army.



"Alright, you call the shots," the knight shrugged his shoulders. "Then shall I start training them on how to grip a sword tomorrow? Even though it might not be very useful..."



"Swords? No, first you take them to form ranks and to run—" Roland suddenly realized that the chief knight might not have experienced these training contents himself, so he had to change his words, "Call over the hunter you found last time, you two watch how I do it first."



...



Today, Tanner experienced more incredibility than he had in the past twenty years combined.



He actually saw the kingdom's Fourth Prince—Prince Roland Wimbledon—up close. The prince walked past him and even smiled at him, my God, was the prince drunk?



Three days ago, when the Fourth Prince gave a speech in the square, Tanner knew that this winter would be different from before. They would not go to the Longsong Stronghold but would spend the long winter here instead. Tanner didn't understand most of the principles the prince talked about, but he agreed with this decision from the bottom of his heart. Tanner's younger brother died in the slums of the stronghold two years ago. For a whole month, there was no food supply, and he shared the few copper coins he earned from unloading goods at the dock to buy some black bread with his brother. But that winter was too cold, the shanties in the slums were drafty everywhere, and that little food couldn't even maintain body temperature. His brother fell ill and fell into a coma, never to wake up again.



In Border Town, he at least had a house built of adobe bricks, not fearing the heavy snow that fell for several days in a row. He also saw the docks filled with wheat brought from other places, being moved into the castle in batches. Therefore, when Tanner heard the news that the Fourth Prince was recruiting militia, he rushed over immediately.



Of course, the reason that tempted him to give up his stonemasonry work and come to enlist right away was the salary of 10 Silver Royals per month. That was already comparable to a skilled bricklayer! He was not young anymore, and by next spring, he planned to marry the tavern waitress Sheryl as his wife. How could he not save up some money now?



As for what the militia was supposed to do, as mentioned in the announcement, he paid no attention at all. Anyway, it wasn't carrying things for those noble lords or being a handyman for the patrol. They surely wouldn't make them climb the town walls to confront the crazed demonic beasts.



The selection process was quite strict, and the knight clad in shining armor watched over them with a gaze that made Tanner a bit afraid. Fortunately, his strong physique passed the inspection, while many of the skinny fellows were picked out of the line by the knight. In the end, only about a hundred of those who came to answer the call were left.



But Tanner had never imagined that the one to train them would be His Highness, the Prince himself!



Those who passed were taken to the grasslands west of Border Town, with the town wall under construction behind them and the endless Misty Forest stretching out before their eyes.



The Prince ordered everyone to line up and stand at attention, then went to rest on the side. It had rained a few days ago, and the ground was still muddy and wet. Water seeped into his shoes through the seams and made Tanner feel uncomfortable all over. Not to mention, the stance required by the Prince was far from ordinary; hands had to be placed vertically along the sides of the thighs, and the spine had to be kept straight as a rod.



Tanner had only stood for a quarter of an hour before feeling utterly exhausted, which seemed even more tiring than breaking stones with a heavy hammer. Yet he gritted his teeth and persevered. Because the Prince had said earlier, whoever moved would get one less egg for lunch. Good heavens, it had been so long since he had tasted the flavor of an egg. It was apparent that those around him felt the same, for despite swaying, most managed to hold out.



It was not until the Prince announced that they could rest in place that Tanner realized he was drenched in sweat, and they hadn't been standing for all that long, at most just half an hour. Those who hadn't persisted to the end were full of regret, as if they could see the round eggs rolling away from them.



Tanner just didn't understand what use there was in practicing this. Could standing still help one carry more bags of dry food?



Had it not been for their esteemed prince training them, he would have started complaining long ago.



Unexpectedly, after a short rest, the next command announced by His Highness was even more bizarre. He demanded that everyone line up and stand at attention again. This time, if no one moved, everyone would get an additional egg for lunch. However, if even one person gave up, everyone would lose the chance of getting the extra egg.



Tanner heard the sound of someone swallowing saliva.



Damn it, was this a trick popular among the kingdom's nobility? Dangling a carrot on a stick to make everyone dance to their tune—he was not a foolish donkey!



...But what if, what if everyone could achieve it? Wouldn't that mean there would be two eggs to eat later?



It was a devil's temptation. Tanner wiped the saliva dripping from the corner of his mouth. For the eggs, he was going all in!
