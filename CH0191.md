## New King's Fang
Peter sipped his tea and leaned back into the comfortable lord's chair, exhaling deeply.

It had been more than two months since he took over Longsong Stronghold, and he found himself growing fonder of this hall by the day. The tiered structure allowed him to look down from his seat at the standing officials and attendants below, a feeling of power that left him thoroughly satisfied.

In the first month, there were some minor nobles who openly challenged him or secretly plotted rebellions—of course, the figures spurring them on were almost certainly from the Elk or Wild Wolf families. Following his father's advice, Peter had all the troublemaking commoners or underground rats without titles sent to the gallows, and the minor nobles imprisoned until their families paid a ransom and were expelled from the Western Territory.

After these thunderous measures were put into place, the situation quickly calmed down. After all, apart from the Honeysuckle family, the knights of the other major families had been captured and taken to Border Town and could not openly resist Peter's policies. Later, he allocated a portion of the stronghold's benefits to compensate the major families for their losses during the captures, temporarily forming a relatively stable alliance of interests among the nobility.

Now, besides the thirty percent of the stronghold's income remitted to Border Town, of the remaining seventy percent, thirty percent was used to maintain city operations, twenty percent to appease the other major nobles, and the Helmann territory received the last twenty percent.

Today, the portrait hanging behind the lord's seat had been changed from Duke Lion to Prince Roland Wimbledon, and Peter Helmann looked forward to the day when his own portrait would be on display.

If he could fully own Longsong Stronghold, his earldom would be connected to the stronghold, becoming a duchy in its own right, and the fifty percent for tribute and pacification could be saved and invested into the stronghold's management and trade, thereby earning a more substantial return.

Of course, this all hinged on Roland successfully ascending the throne to become the king over all of Graycastle.

"My lord," a guard entered the lord's hall, presenting a letter, "It's a message from Border Town."



Upon hearing the word Border Town, Peter immediately sat up straight.

He took the envelope, smoothed out the thin papyrus, and could tell from the poor quality of the paper that the letter came from the spies he had planted among the serf troops.

The outcome of the battle more than two months ago was beyond belief, and although Peter did not go there personally, he had heard a bizarre story from his father. To clarify the cause of the Duke's failure, he arranged many of his confidants among the people sent to the town. Disguised as craftsmen, herdsmen, or serfs, they relayed back the information they saw to the stronghold.

He believed that other families would certainly do the same.

But so far, apart from the two disguised as serfs who were still sending new intelligence every month, there had been no word from those craftsmen and herdsmen, as if they had vanished into thin air.

Had they betrayed him, or had they all been discovered by the prince and eradicated?

He shook his head and focused on the secret letter.

The content of the letter was written with a charcoal pencil, the handwriting was crooked, and some parts even bore traces of water damage, suggesting it was written sneakily while working.

The first paragraph mentioned that on the banks of the Redwater River, an iron tower of unclear purpose was being constructed. A huge iron vat was stacked on top of the tower, and three had already been erected, each nearly as tall as the walls of the stronghold. It seemed that the blacksmiths completed the manufacture of the iron towers in the town and transported them to the riverbank as a whole. Then the First Army soldiers would erect barricades around the iron towers, and by the next day, they would miraculously stand tall.



"Construction"… Again this word, Peter thought, the last secret letter mentioned the same, just by looking at the intelligence, it seemed that the prince was continuously building the town, last time it was roads and bridges, this time it was an iron tower. Could it be that His Highness intends to spend all the Gold royals plundered from the Stronghold Castle before he is satisfied? Moreover, the purpose of the iron tower remains unclear… It should be noted that the spy hidden among the serfs is not a real serf, but a well-informed personal guard. If it were a watchtower or an arrow tower, he would definitely recognize it at a glance.



Perhaps it's hard to judge because the iron tower is not yet fully completed, Peter shook his head. Maybe there will be more detailed intelligence next month.



He shifted his gaze to the next paragraph.



The letter mentioned that a large merchant fleet stayed at the town's dock for a week before departing eastward, with unknown affiliation. During their stay, they unloaded large piles of ore ingots and saltpeter.



It was easy to understand the purchase of saltpeter, as the summer heat would become intense in the second month, and the castle would need to consume a lot of saltpeter for cooling, which could also be used to refrigerate wine and juice. As a member of the royal nobility, he certainly would not want to be sweating profusely all day, as disheveled as the peasants in the fields.



However, the purchase of ore ingots had taken Peter by surprise. Border Town was an ore-producing region. He remembered, before the Evil Months, when he went to the town as an envoy, Prince Roland had boasted about doubling the total amount of ore sold. And now, not only was there no export of ore, but there was also the import of ore ingots?



Linking this to the previous paragraph about the iron tower as tall as the walls of Stronghold, he found himself increasingly unable to understand what His Highness the prince was trying to do.



However, when Peter read the last section of the secret letter, he was momentarily stunned.



Border Town had hosted several open-air theater performances in the square in the past two weeks?



No admission fee, the name of the play was unheard of, and even serfs were encouraged to watch. What surprised him the most was that among the performers was the recently missing Star of the Western Region, Miss May!

What was going on?

May's disappearance was a big piece of news in the stronghold recently, with several plays that she was supposed to star in having to replace the leading lady, prompting the nobles to leave halfway in protest. The theater had no choice but to issue a notice, stating that May had left the theater without telling anyone and her whereabouts were currently unknown. As soon as the news came out, it immediately caused an uproar among the Western Region's nobility who were fond of drama.

And now she had run off to Border Town? There wasn't even a theater there! And to perform for commoners and serfs... Peter found it hard to imagine such a scene, as the Miss May he remembered was not an actress who was approachable and friendly.

After much consideration, he decided to write a letter to Prince Roland, to formally inquire about this matter. As a drama enthusiast, not only had he missed the splendid performances of the Star of the Western Region for a long time, but also the opportunities to invite Sheryl had become much less frequent. Since the play was publicly performed in the town square, it was not surprising that a merchant had seen it, and it just so happened that this merchant came from Longsong Stronghold, therefore the news reached his own ears—thinking this way, it should not expose the guards hidden among the serfs.

Just as Peter was preparing to have his attendant draft the letter, a knight strode quickly into the hall, saying urgently, "My lord, the guards on the eastern watchtower have spotted a troop of knights approaching the stronghold!"

"Knights? Can you tell where they are from?" He suddenly stood up.

"The other party is carrying the banner of the Twin Dragons of the High Tower, my lord," the knight replied, "If they are not impersonating, they should be the troops of the new king."
