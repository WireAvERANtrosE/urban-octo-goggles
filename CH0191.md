## Teeth of the New King
Petro sipped his red tea, leaned back into the soft lord's chair, and let out a long sigh.

Since taking over the Longsong Stronghold more than two months ago, he found himself growing fonder of this hall. The tiered structure allowed him to look down on the standing officials and servants from his main seat, a sensation of power that filled him with satisfaction.

In the first month, there were some minor nobles who openly questioned him, or secretly planned rebellions—of course, those stirring them up were mostly from the Elk, Swift Wolf and several other big families. Petro followed his father's advice, sending the title-less troublemaking civilians and underground rats straight to the gallows, and imprisoning the minor nobility until their families paid the ransom and they were expelled from the Western Territory.

After implementing these thunderous measures, the situation quickly calmed down. After all, aside from the Golden Flower family, the knights from the other families had been taken to Border Town and couldn't openly resist Petro's policies. Afterwards, he allocated a part of the stronghold's benefits to compensate the big families for their losses during the arrests, temporarily forming a relatively stable interest group among the nobility.

Nowadays, aside from the three-tenths of the stronghold's revenue sent to Border Town, of the remaining seven-tenths, three-tenths were used to maintain the city's operations, two-tenths to appease the other nobility, and the remaining two-tenths went to the Honeymar territory.

Today, the portrait hanging behind the lord's seat had been changed from Duke Ryan to the Fourth Prince, Roland Wimbledon. He looked forward to the day when his own portrait—Petro Honeymar—would be displayed.

If he could fully own Longsong Stronghold, his earldom would be connected to the stronghold, becoming a true ducal territory, and the five-tenths for tribute and appeasement could be saved and invested in the management and trade of the stronghold for a richer return.

Of course, this was all predicated on Roland successfully ascending to the throne to become the king of the entire Greycastle.

"My lord," a guard entered the lord's hall, handing over a letter, "It's a message from Border Town."



Upon hearing the word Border Town, Petro immediately sat upright.

He took the envelope, smoothed out the thin papyrus, and could tell from the poor quality of the paper that the letter was from a spy he had planted among the serf teams.

The results of the battle more than two months ago were astonishing, and although Petro had not gone in person, he had heard an incredible story from his father. In order to understand the reasons behind the Duke's failure, he had arranged many of his confidants among the people he sent to the small town. They disguised themselves as craftsmen, herdsmen, or serfs, and sent back to the fortress any intelligence they gathered.

He believed that other families would surely do the same.

But so far, apart from the two disguised as serfs who still sent back new intelligence every month, those craftsmen and herdsmen had disappeared without a trace, as if they had vanished into thin air.

Had they betrayed him, or had the prince discovered them and eradicated them all?

He shook his head and focused on the secret letter.

The content of the letter was written in charcoal, with crooked lines and some parts showing signs of water damage, suggesting it had been written in stealth while working.

The first paragraph mentioned that on the banks of the Redwater River, iron towers of unknown purpose were being constructed. A huge iron can was piled on top of each tower, and three had already been erected, each nearly as tall as the fortress walls. It seemed that the blacksmiths were completing the iron towers in the town and by the time they were transported to the riverbank, they were already whole. Then soldiers from the First Army would erect barriers around the iron towers, and by the next day, they would magically stand upright.



"Construction"... that word again, Piro thought, the last secret letter was the same. Just by looking at the intelligence, it felt like the prince was constantly building the town—last time it was roads and bridges, this time it was a metal tower. Could His Highness really be content only after spending all the Gold royals plundered from the fortress castle? And the use of the metal tower was still unclear... It should be known that the spies hidden among the serfs were not real serfs but well-informed personal guards. If it were a watchtower or an arrow tower, he would have recognized it at a glance.

Perhaps it was difficult to judge because the metal tower was not yet fully completed, Piro shook his head. Maybe there would be more detailed intelligence next month.

He moved his gaze to the next paragraph.

The letter mentioned that a large merchant fleet stayed at the town's dock for a week before departing eastward, with unclear affiliation. During their stay, they unloaded piles of ore ingots and saltpeter.

It was easy to understand the purchase of saltpeter. It would become extremely hot from the second month of summer; the castle needed a large amount of saltpeter for cooling, and it could also be used to refrigerate wine and juice. As a royal noble, he certainly wouldn't want to be sweating profusely all day, as disgracefully as the farmers in the fields.

However, the purchase of ore ingots was somewhat surprising to Piro. Border Town was already an ore-producing region. He remembered that before the Evil Months, when he went to the town as an envoy, Prince Roland had boasted about doubling the total amount of ore sold. And now, not only was there no export of ore, but they were importing ore ingots?

Linking this to the metal tower as tall as the fortress walls mentioned in the previous paragraph, he found himself becoming more and more confused about what Prince His Highness was trying to do.

But when Piro read the last section of the secret letter, he was stunned.

Border Town had held several open-air theater performances in the square over the past two weeks?



No entrance fee, an unheard-of play name, and even encouraging serfs to watch. What surprised him most was that the performance included Miss May, the recently missing Star of the Western Region!

What was going on?

May's disappearance was big news at the fortress recently, with several plays that were supposed to star her having to change their leading lady, prompting nobles to leave midway in protest. The theater had to issue a notice, claiming that Miss May had left without informing anyone and her whereabouts were currently unknown. The news shocked the nobility of the Western Region who were fond of plays.

And now she had run off to Border Town? There was no theater there! And she was performing for commoners and serfs... Petro found it difficult to imagine such a scene, as Miss May he knew was not an actress who was easy to approach.

After much consideration, he decided to write a letter to Prince Roland, formally asking about this matter. As a drama enthusiast, not only had he missed the brilliant performances of the Star of the Western Region for a long time, but also his opportunities to invite Sheryl had greatly diminished. Since the play was publicly performed in the town square, it was not surprising that a merchant had seen it. Coincidentally, this merchant came from Longsong Fortress, which was how the news reached him—it seemed unlikely that his guards hidden among the serfs would be exposed.

Just as Petro was about to have his servant draft the letter, a knight strode into the hall and said urgently, "My lord, the guards at the East Watchtower have spotted a cavalry troop approaching the fortress!"

"Knights? Can you tell where they're from?" he suddenly stood up.

"They're carrying the flag of the High Tower Twin Muskets, my lord," the knight replied. "If they're not impostors, they should be the troops of the new king."
