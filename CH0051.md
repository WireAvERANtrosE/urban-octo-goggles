## Her Majesty the Queen
Through the narrow, tall windows of the terrace, the afterglow of the sunset scattered across the floor, casting dark red stripes on the walls.



There are few places left in the kingdom where the sunset can still be seen, and Clearwater Harbor is one of them. According to the legend, the influence of the Evil Months, shrouded in heavy snow and cold winds, is negligible here. Except for the inability of the Black Sail Fleet to set sail, the entire city remains as busy as usual.



And the master of this harbor city, Grace Wimbledon, was sitting at the square table under the window, earnestly reading the letter in her hand. Her gray hair was tinged with a touch of gold by the sunset, and the contrasting light and shadow on her face further highlighted her distinct facial features, which were unique and full of heroic charm.



Farrina had been standing beside her for quite a while now.



Even though the time spent on this letter had exceeded her normal reading time, Farrina still chose to wait quietly—she was unwilling to interrupt this peace.



Eventually, Grace let out a soft sigh and put down the letter.



"My father has died."



Farrina was taken aback, "What?"



"My father, King Wimbledon of Greycastle, has died."



She rarely repeated what she had said, he thought, and if he asked her this on any other occasion, she would have ignored it. But she wasn't joking? The King is dead?



"..."Farrina opened her mouth, wanting to comfort her with a few words, but what came out was a question, "How did he die?"



Fortunately, Grace didn't mind—she was the third princess of the kingdom, the Lord of Clearwater Harbor, and the supreme commander of the Black Sail Fleet. She didn't need anyone's comfort, "The letter said that it was my brother Herman who killed our father, and then he was captured by the royal guards. He didn't commit suicide out of fear of his crime, so he was brought to a public trial by the King's hand and several other ministers, and has been sentenced to death by beheading."



"That's not normal," Farrina said subconsciously.



"Of course it's not normal," Grace said expressionlessly, "My brother might be a bit dumb, but he is not stupid enough to seek his own death. Without someone leading him, he wouldn't have done such a thing."



"Someone framed him?"



"Let me guess..." The third princess closed her eyes, "Someone probably laid out a detailed plan, tempting him by offering to help him ascend to the throne—getting people into the inner yard of the king's castle would require prior arrangements, including elimination, replacement, and bribery. But that's not Herman's strong suit, or rather, he's too lazy to bother with such trivial matters. The rest is simple. The person who made the plans won his trust but betrayed him in the end."



Farrina neither agreed nor disagreed; these were all speculations, and the process wasn't important—the outcome was. She believed that Princess Grace thought the same.



Indeed, Grace opened her eyes and continued, "Such people are a dime a dozen around the Crown Prince, all brawn and no brains, easily manipulated by others—that's normal. Only..." she said, her tone carrying a hint of anger, "my second brother's methods are too crude."



"Are you saying that it was done by Timothy Wimbledon?" 

"Who else knows Herman so well? After this incident, who else stands to benefit the most?" Grace's fingers tapped on the desk unconsciously, "Even a blind man can see it! Yet with Father's favoritism towards him, he didn't need to go this far at all!"



Her Highness is angry, Farien realized, it was rare to see the Third Princess display such an expression. It seemed that despite her constant complaints about King Wimbledon III's excessive favoritism, she never wished for her father to meet such an end.



Farien could somewhat understand this sentiment; within a large family, the feeling the head of the family gave to the younger generation was always the same—a towering mountain they wished to surpass, both revered and detested. If what she said was correct, and this was indeed the doing of the Second Prince, then his actions could truly be described as brutal.



"But why... why would he do such a thing?"



"Because he's afraid of me," Grace took a deep breath, seemingly trying to control her emotions, "he's afraid of the Black Sail."



Seeing that Farien did not respond, she continued to explain, "Timothy has spies in Clearwater Harbor, which isn't surprising, just as I have my own informants in both Valencia and the capital. After learning of the existence of the Black Sail Fleet, it was easy to guess what my next move would be—Valencia could not possibly raise an army capable of contending with the Black Sail. So, he used the most foolish method, using Herman as bait to get what he wanted."



"Are you saying that he wanted an army?"



"He wanted the throne," said Grace, "With Herman's death, he becomes the first in line to succeed. And with Father gone, he's probably on his way to the capital right now. As long as he can become Wimbledon IV, he can mobilize the vassals and armies without any territorial restrictions." She shook her head, "However, as I said, being the most beloved son of our father, he really didn't need to go to such lengths."



"Isn't that bad," said Farrina worriedly, "What if the Second Prince is crowned successfully, declares the Fight for the Throne ended, and orders you back to King's City?"



Grace sneered, "He's being too blunt with this move. Just because Father favors him doesn't mean all the ministers will support him, especially with the act of plotting against the King—although Timothy has pinned it on Herman, it might only fool the commoners of the kingdom. For him to completely seize control of Greycastle's power, it will probably take a long time. So..." She looked at Farrina, "I have to slightly change the plan."



Farrina immediately knelt on one knee, "I am at your command."



Grace stood up and walked to the window, turning her back to Farrina, "After his coronation, he will certainly try to deal with me first, but the only means he can use is probably ordering Duke Ryan—Joyce Cole of the Southern Territory to pressure me. And the latter will probably use the excuse that it's inappropriate to mobilize troops during the national mourning period for the new King's passing—that old fox has never liked to make a loss. At most, he will gather the vassals and make a show of force on the border of Clearwater Harbor," the Third Princess paused slightly, "However, these actions will cause us unnecessary trouble, so we set sail tomorrow."



"Sail? Your Highness, are you planning to..."



"Eagle City, being located in the heartland of the kingdom, is almost an undefended city. Through the tributaries of Redwater River, one can reach Clearwater Town, and from there, it only takes a day to get to Eagle City. After taking down Joyce, the entire Southern Territory will be under my control. It's an interesting temporal difference: when he sits on the throne and tries to instruct Duke Joyce, he will find that the entire Southern Territory has already become my domain. I wonder what his expression will be."



"But, as you said, King Wimbledon III has just passed away, so—"



"What, do I need to shed tears first?" Grace turned around, the setting sun sinking into the horizon draped her in a layer of purple-red gauze. Her face was shrouded in darkness, with only her eyes emitting a faint glow. Those eyes were firm as rock, and Farrina thought that even if there was anger or regret within, there would certainly be no sorrow.



Sorrow does not suit a sovereign.



"No, you don't need to," he said seriously.

Grace nodded in satisfaction, "Go, summon all the captains to me. Since Timothy is unwilling to wait for five years, I will not disappoint him. After taking Eagle City, the entire Southern Territory will be independent."

Whether it was Timothy's doing or not was irrelevant, he thought. She always managed to find her own path through the unpredictable circumstances, and once she made a decision, she would forge ahead with courage. That was her charm, and the reason he had followed her to this point.

"By your command, Your Highness... no," Farryn replied solemnly, "Your Majesty the Queen."
