## The Path of Pioneering
Roland took a sip of tea and continued, "Additionally, I plan to start basic education at Longsong Stronghold. This will also be a test to see if you can continue to manage Longsong Stronghold."



Upon hearing the word 'test', Petro's ears perked up. "Basic education?"



"That's right." He nodded with a smile. With the church destroyed and the High Priest killed, the church's influence here has been greatly weakened, presenting an excellent opportunity to vie for the ideological battleground. He didn't expect to turn all believers into potential qualified workers, but further diminishing the church's influence would suffice. If Holy City wished to meddle with Longsong Stronghold again, Roland had numerous ways to keep them out, and building a new church was out of the question.



"Basic education is for all residents under the age of forty at the fortress, regardless of gender, and it includes literacy, simple arithmetic, general knowledge of nature, and ideological education," Roland gestured with his hand to quell any objections. "Don't worry, the cost will be deducted from the taxes paid to Border Town. From this month, you only need to pay twenty percent of the taxes, and the remaining ten percent will be used as a special fund for educationâ€”you can recruit a few scholars from the capital or hire local knights and down-and-out nobles, but they won't cost much. Ten percent of the taxes should amount to nearly a thousand Gold Royals, so your responsibilities go far beyond this."



After thinking for a moment, Petro spoke, "Your Highness, do you mean to use this money to motivate the residents to accept education?"



Roland smiled at his quick understanding. "Exactly. Aside from children, most people have to work during the day, so their education should take place at night. After a whole day of work and finally time to rest, no one wants to listen to someone droning on, especially since learning to read requires mental effort."



"So, you can use some methods to entice them to learn, such as providing a meaty dinner, or monetary rewards for those who make quick progress, and of course, bright and spacious classrooms are essential." He paused for a moment. "In any case, you must find every way to popularize this work among all the residents of the stronghold. As I said, this is also part of your test: after one year, I expect more than half of the stronghold's population to be literate."



"But Your Highness..." Petro hesitated, "Whether it's scholars or nobles, they have no experience in teaching literacy, let alone spreading general knowledge of nature and ideological education," he struggled with the complicated terms, "In fact, I don't quite understand them myself. With these people, I'm afraid it won't achieve the effect you want."



"I've taken this into account as well," Roland reassured, "Don't worry, I will send a group of officials from the City Hall to assist you with this task, and the books needed for education will also be provided by Border Town. They are experienced and can first train the people you recruit before educating the residents. You will understand once you discuss with them in detail, and they will handle the specifics."



In this way, as long as he still wanted to control the fortress, he would inevitably have to make use of these people, the Prince thought. And by placing his trusted officials in the Department of Education, news from the Longsong Stronghold could be relayed back to Border Town at the first opportunity.



Seeing that Petrov did not object, Roland began to give his final order: "The third thing is, I plan to build a road between Longsong Stronghold and Border Town to shorten the travel time for pedestrians and caravans between the two places."



"Your Highness, there is already a road between the two places, isn't there?" Petrov asked in surprise.



A small mud path trampled by feet counts as a road? Less than two meters wide, it becomes full of mud whenever it rains, and the road is riddled with potholes; it's not suitable for carriages to travel at high speed at all. Roland shook his head, "The road I want to build will accommodate two carriages side by side, with a flat and straight surface that doesn't accumulate water when it rains, just like the streets of Border Town."



"Are you referring to a gravel road?" the acting lord appeared somewhat astonished, "Such roads aren't cheap to construct. It requires stonemasons to quarry and break the stones, selecting appropriately sized stones to be used together. Building a gravel road from the stronghold to Border Town would cost at least five thousand Gold royals. Your Highness, forgive my bluntness, but without raising taxes, Longsong Stronghold likely can't afford such an expense."



"The stronghold only needs to provide labor," the Prince stated directly, "You are to issue a recruitment notice to all the territories in the Western Region, not just Longsong Stronghold, but also including the territories of the major families. The pay will be six Silver royals per month, for a duration of one year. I believe there will be quite a few people who will answer the call."



"For a laborer, six Silver royals is quite a high salary," Petrov nodded, "May I ask how many people you are planning to recruit?"



"At least two thousand," Roland replied.



Just the cost of hiring laborers would be a considerable amount each month, and adding the stonemasons and stone workers, it was definitely considered a high expense in the eyes of others, a fact evident from their expressions. However, now that Border Town was able to sell steam engines, its income and expenditures could basically maintain a balance. Roland never intended to keep all the Gold royals stored in a warehouse. The saying goes, 'to get rich, build roads first.' Investing surplus funds into infrastructure was undoubtedly the best choice.



Building a high-quality road connecting the fortress and Border Town is of great significance. It not only facilitates future trade and contact between the two places but is also a prerequisite for the rapid deployment of troops. If transportation is inconvenient, even if we receive news of the fortress being attacked, by the time we rush over after three days, I'm afraid the enemy's flag would already be flying above the city walls.



"I understand," said Petro in acknowledgment.



"That's all you need to do for now, I will soon return to Border Town. Work hard, 'Ambassador' Mister, do not let me down again."



As Petro took his leave, something suddenly occurred to him, and he stopped to ask, "Your Highness, what should we do with those imprisoned in the jail?"



For the first time, Roland did not answer so readily. He remained silent for a moment before speaking, "Keep them alive for now, they won't live much longer anyway."



...



Boarding the Little Town, the prince set off on his return journey.



"You seem to be in a bad mood?" Nightingale appeared and tilted her head to ask, "Is it because of those civilians?"



"They were all forced by Timothy," Roland sighed, "If it weren't for the pills they swallowed, being manipulated by others, they would not have become the enemy's pawns, dying on this unfamiliar land."



"It's not your fault," Nightingale reached out and took hold of his arm.

"Of course not," Roland said without hesitation, "If I can't stop them, the town would become a victim of Timothy's lust for power. Naturally, the church that makes the pills is also one of the main culprits."

"So you're going to destroy the church, put an end to the strife, and make sure people no longer have to kill each other over such senseless reasons, right?" Nightingale asked with a smile, "Whether they are commoners or witches, they can all live happily under your rule."

"..." Roland looked into her shining eyes and nodded gently, "Yes, I promise."
