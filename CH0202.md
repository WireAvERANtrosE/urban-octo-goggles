## Path of Pioneering
Roland took a sip of tea and continued, "Additionally, I plan to initiate basic education in Longsong Stronghold, and this will also be an assessment of whether you can continue to manage Longsong Stronghold."



Upon hearing the word 'assessment,' Peter's ears perked up. "Basic education?"



"Exactly," he said with a smile. Now that the church has been destroyed and the Archpriest killed, the church's influence here has been greatly weakened. It's an opportune time to compete for the ideological battleground. He didn't expect to turn all the believers into potential qualified workers; just further diminishing the church's influence would suffice. If the Holy City sought to interfere with Longsong Stronghold again, Roland had numerous ways to keep them at bay, and the idea of building new churches was out of the question.



"Basic education is for all residents of the stronghold under forty, regardless of gender. The curriculum includes reading and writing, basic arithmetic, general knowledge of nature, and ideological education." Roland waved his hand to forestall any questions, "Don't worry, the expenses will be deducted from the taxes paid to Border Town. Starting this month, you only need to pay twenty percent of the taxes, and the remaining ten percent will be allocated as special funds for educationâ€”you can recruit some scholars from the capital, or hire local knights and destitute nobles, but they won't cost much. Ten percent of the taxes should amount to at least nearly a thousand gold royals, so you'll have much more to do."



Peter thought for a moment and said, "Your Highness, do you mean to use this money to encourage residents to receive education?"



This guy was indeed sharp. Roland smiled and said, "Correct. Besides children, most people have to earn a living during the day, so their education should take place in the evening. After a busy day, when they finally have time to rest, nobody wants to listen to someone else prattle on, not to mention that learning to read and write requires thinking."



"Therefore, you can use some methods to entice them to learn, such as providing dinners with meat, or offering monetary rewards for those who make swift progress in their learning. Of course, bright and spacious classrooms are also essential." He paused, "In any case, you must do everything possible to popularize this work among all residents of the stronghold. As I said, this is also an assessment for you: in one year, I expect over fifty percent of the stronghold's population to be literate."



"But Your Highness..." Peter hesitated, "Whether it's scholars or nobles, they have no experience in teaching literacy, let alone general knowledge of nature and ideological education," he enunciated the cumbersome terms, "In fact, I don't quite understand it myself. With these people, I'm afraid we won't achieve the effect you desire."



"I've taken that into account as well," Roland reassured, "Don't worry, I will send a group of municipal officials from Border Town to assist you with this matter, and the books needed for education will also be provided by Border Town. They are experienced and can first conduct training sessions for the staff you recruit before educating the residents. Once you talk to them in detail, you'll understand, and they can handle the specifics."



In this way, as long as he still wanted to continue managing the stronghold, he would inevitably have to employ these people. The prince thought that by placing trusted officials from the Ministry of Education, news from Longsong Stronghold could be relayed back to Border Town at the first instance.



Seeing that Peter raised no objections, Roland began to give his final order: "The third matter, I plan to build a road between Longsong Stronghold and Border Town to reduce the travel time for pedestrians and merchant caravans between the two places."



"Your Highness, there is already a road between the two places, isn't there?" Peter asked in surprise.



A muddy path trampled by feet counts as a road? It's less than two meters wide, filled with mud when it rains, and full of potholes everywhere, not at all suitable for carriages to travel at high speed. Roland shook his head, "The road I want to build will be able to accommodate two carriages traveling side by side, with a flat and straight surface that does not accumulate water when it rains, just like the streets of Border Town."



"Do you mean a gravel road?" The acting lord looked somewhat surprised, "Such roads are not cheap to construct. They require stonemasons to quarry and break the stone, selecting stones of appropriate size to fit together before it can be used. Building a gravel road from the stronghold to Border Town would cost at least five thousand Gold royals. Your Highness, forgive my bluntness, but without raising taxes, Longsong Stronghold may not be able to afford such an expense."



"The stronghold only needs to provide manpower." The prince stated directly, "Issue a recruitment notice to all the territories in the Western Region, not just Longsong Stronghold, but also including the territories of the major families. The wage will be six Silver royals per month, for a period of one year. I believe there will be quite a few people who will respond."



"For a laborer, six Silver royals is a relatively high wage," Peter nodded, "May I ask how many people you intend to recruit?"



"At least two thousand," Roland replied.



Just the cost of hiring laborers alone amounted to a considerable sum each month, not to mention stonemasons and stonebreakers. In the eyes of others, this would definitely be considered a high expense, and few lords would be willing to spend their money on something that seems to have no return, which could be seen from the other person's expression. However, Border Town was now able to sell steam engines, and its income and expenditure could basically maintain a balance. Roland never intended to store all the Gold royals in the warehouse. As the saying goes, to get rich one must first build roads, so investing surplus funds into infrastructure was undoubtedly the best choice.



Constructing a high-quality road that connects Stronghold and Border Town is of significant importance. It will not only facilitate future commerce and communication between the two places but is also a prerequisite for the rapid deployment of the army. If transportation is inconvenient, even if we receive news of Stronghold being attacked, by the time we arrive three days later, I fear the enemy's flag might already be flying over the city walls.



"I understand," Peter responded, accepting the order.



"That's all you need to do for now. I will be returning to Border Town shortly. Do your job well, Mr. 'Ambassador,' and don't disappoint me again."



As Peter was leaving, he suddenly remembered something, stopped in his tracks, and asked, "Your Highness, what about those people imprisoned in the jail?"



Roland's answer was not as forthcoming as the first time; he fell silent for a moment before speaking, "Keep them alive for now; they won't live much longer anyway."



...



Boarding the "Littletown," the prince embarked on his return journey.



"You seem to be in a poor mood?" Nightingale materialized and asked, tilting her head, "Is it because of those civilians?"



"They were forced by Timothy," Roland sighed. "If they hadn't been drugged and controlled by others, they wouldn't have become pawns for the other side, dying on this unfamiliar land."



"This is not your fault." Nightingale reached out and took hold of his arm.

"Of course not," Roland said without hesitation, "If I can't stop them, the town will become a victim of Timothy's thirst for power. Certainly, the church that manufactures the pills is also one of the main culprits."

"So, you will destroy the church, put an end to the strife, and make it so that people no longer have to kill each other over such senseless reasons, right?" Nightingale asked with a smile, "Whether they are commoners or witches, they will be able to live happily under your rule."

"..." Roland looked into her shining eyes and nodded gently, "Yes, I promise."
