## Light industry
Roland sat in front of his desk, looking with interest at the Chief Knight who had come to report on the current situation of the First Army.

Compared to his meticulous demeanor a few months ago, Carter's icy facade now bore a mix of different emotions. The sense of calm had somewhat faded, replaced by anticipation and impatience.

It probably has something to do with the Star of the Western Region, he thought.

Roland had also heard a bit about Carter's recent closeness with May. After all, as one of the First Army's senior leaders and his own representative in the military, people paid attention to his every move, especially when May, such a conspicuous woman, was involved.

When they first appeared side by side on the streets of the town, his personal guards had already passed the news to him.

Roland didn't mind such matters. Carter was probably two or three years older than himself, and it was indeed strange that he was still unmarried. If he could find his other half in the Western Region, that would be nice, as long as it didn't affect his work.

According to the Chief Knight's report, the First Army had about two hundred revolving rifles issued, with about ten more being added every day—in fact, if there were enough raw materials, Anna's production capacity could increase several times over. However, since she was also responsible for smelting iron and manufacturing steam engines, the pace had slowed down.

This pace was acceptable, though, since the First Army only had six hundred men; they would be fully equipped in another month and a half. And until the new wave of population expansion arrived, the size of the army could not be further increased.

Another point was the formation of the Second Army.



To facilitate training and maintain secrecy, the civilians recruited from Longsong Stronghold passed the review and were all assigned by Roland to the Second Army. They are currently undergoing disciplinary training, which is the set of military drills. In the evening, they have ideological education classes, striving to instill in these people the belief that they are the guardians of the Western Region, and the safety of their loved ones depends on their protection.



"The training progress of the Second Army personnel is going well. It is expected that in another week, they will be able to move on to shooting training. By then, the number of flintlock guns eliminated will be enough for one per person," Carter summarized.



This is also the advantage of firearms; training a cold weapon soldier takes at least one year, while training a knight takes about five or six years. In contrast, a musketeer only needs one month to be battle-ready. The longer a battle lasts, the greater the advantage of musketeers—after all, pulling a trigger is much less exhausting than swinging a sword in combat.



"Make sure to manage the firearms well during live-fire practice; the number issued must be the same number returned. The same goes for gunpowder; distribute it on-site during practice and have veterans from the First Army oversee it."



"Yes," he nodded in response.



"Good," Roland waved his hand, "With that settled, you can go back to your duties."



"Uh, Your Highness..." Carter hesitated before asking, "You said last time that the perfume mixed into the soap is made from sugarcane, is that true?"



"Yes," the prince leaned back in his chair, "Why do you ask?"



"Is sugarcane very expensive?"



"No... just ordinary crops."

"I heard that in the King's City, a bottle of perfume the size of a thumb can sell for five Gold Royals," Carter scratched his head, "If that's true, wouldn't making perfume from sugarcane bring a substantial income to the town?"

"Five Gold Royals?" Roland was taken aback; he hadn't considered this. Recalling his time in the palace, the Fourth Prince never cared about the price of daily necessities, and even less so for something like perfume which he seldom came into contact with—it was only women who favored such fragrances that made them smell delightful.

His initial motive for making perfume was just to have scented soap. Otherwise, having running water without soap in the bathroom always seemed lacking; it was the romance of the bathroom to have bubbles covering one's body.

If a small bottle of perfume could indeed sell for several Gold Royals, that would indeed be a good business. Unlike coated mirrors, the raw materials of sugarcane and flowers were much cheaper than crystal glass.

With that thought, Roland smiled and said, "That's not a bad idea, I'll consider it."

"Your Highness, then... may I take a stick of sugarcane out of the castle?" The Chief Knight asked with anticipation.

"No problem," hearing the tone, he guessed what the other party wanted to do—the plants of the Fjords were quite rare in the Western Region, unlike Clearwater Port, and using it as a gift to please a lady was a good choice, "It's on the back wall of the backyard, help yourself."

"Thank you, Your Highness!" Carter bowed and excused himself.



Subsequently, Roland summoned Barov—referring to him as the Assistant Minister was no longer quite appropriate. As the top official of the City Hall, he could be considered the chief administrator of Border Town.



After Barov was seated, Roland briefly mentioned the matter of perfume, "What do you think of this business? Can it earn a large sum of Gold Royals?"



He did not answer immediately but instead widened his eyes and asked in return, "Your Highness, are you really certain that perfume is made from that kind of sweet crop?"



"Isn't the soap also distributed for your use? The reason it is fragrant is that perfume is mixed into it," Roland explained with a shrug, "Its ingredients are indeed these worthless things. I am just not sure whether the perfume in the capital is as expensive as Carter said."



"Far more than that, Your Highness!" Barov said excitedly, "Perfume is the alchemy association's highly confidential product in the capital, with only about a thousand bottles produced each year, and only a small part of them is sold in the capital. If sold to other cities in Greycastle, the price can increase by twenty to thirty percent, and if sold to the Fjords and other kingdoms, the price can nearly double. To prevent merchants from profiting from the price difference, the association not only tightly controls the perfume prices in other places but also personally appoints the merchants. If you can produce perfume, even if you only sell it to Redwater City and Dragon Cliffs City, you can reap a substantial return."



"I see." As someone who had served as the Finance assistant minister for twenty years, Roland thought, Barov was indeed very knowledgeable about product pricing and trade conditions. With this information, he also formed a preliminary plan in his mind.



There were many methods to produce perfume; the simplest was to crush petals or herbs with a unique fragrance into alcohol, allowing the alcohol to dissolve the aromatic oils in the plants, and then filtering out the residue and adding water to dilute it for use.



The alcohol came from the fermentation of sugarcane juice; the raw materials for the aromatic oils could be roses, or more commonly, rosemary and verveine. However, since mass production was the goal, cultivating a batch of genetically modified plants that could directly secrete aromatic oils was the best choice.



Aside from perfume, this industry could also produce sugar and liquor, which were also in high demand as consumables. Although the profits were not as high as for perfume, selling them at a low price to the townspeople to enrich their diet would also be a significant improvement for the people's livelihood.



Roland has been slow to develop light industry due to the reason that with insufficient manpower, small-scale production of daily necessities is unlikely to yield high profits. It is much more cost-effective to allocate the limited population to the production of heavy industry.



Since the production of perfume is profitable, perhaps he could take this opportunity to fill in this missing link.
