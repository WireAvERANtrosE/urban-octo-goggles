## Light Industry
Roland sat in front of his desk, eyeing with interest the Chief Knight who had come to report on the current situation of the First Army.

Compared to his meticulous demeanor a few months ago, Carter's stoic face now bore a mix of different emotions; the sense of calm had somewhat faded, replaced by anticipation and impatience.

It probably has something to do with the Star of the Western Region, he thought.

Roland had also heard a bit about Carter's recent closeness with May. After all, as one of the top brass of the First Army and his own representative in the military, people paid attention to his every move, especially when accompanied by a woman as noticeable as May.

The news had already reached him when they first appeared side by side on the streets of the town.

Roland didn't mind such matters. Carter was probably two or three years older than himself, and it was indeed strange that he was still unmarried. If he could find his better half in the Western Region, it would be good, as long as it didn't affect his work.

According to the Chief Knight's report, the First Army now had about two hundred revolving rifles in service, with about ten more being added every day—in fact, if there were enough raw materials, Anna's production capacity could increase manifold, but since she was also responsible for iron smelting and steam engine manufacturing, the rate of production had slowed.

Nevertheless, this pace was acceptable. After all, the First Army only had six hundred men, and it would be possible to complete the rearmament in another month and a half. Until the next wave of population expansion arrived, it was impossible to further increase the size of the army.

Another point was the formation of the Second Army.



For the sake of convenience in training and the need for secrecy, the civilians conscripted from Longsong Stronghold, after passing the screening, were all incorporated into the Second Army by Roland. They are currently undergoing discipline training, which is the set of military drills. In the evening, they have ideological education classes, striving to instill in these people the belief that they are the guardians of the Western Territory and that the safety of their loved ones depends on their protection.



"The training progress of the Second Army personnel is good. It is expected that in another week, they will be able to move on to shooting training. By that time, there will be enough flintlock guns eliminated for everyone to have one," Carter concluded.



This is also the advantage of firearms. Training a cold weapon soldier takes at least a year, while training a knight takes about five to six years. However, a musketeer only needs one month to be combat-ready. The longer a battle lasts, the greater the advantage of the musketeer—after all, pulling a trigger is much less strenuous than wielding a sword in combat.



"Be sure to manage the firearms well during live ammunition practice. Account for every gun that is issued and make sure the same amount is returned. The same goes for gunpowder; it should be distributed on the spot during practice, with veterans from the First Army responsible for supervision."



"Yes," he nodded in response.



"Very good," Roland waved his hand, "In that case, you may go on with your duties."



"Uh, Your Highness..." Carter hesitated before saying, "You mentioned last time that the perfume mixed into the soap is made from sugarcane, is that true?"



"Yes," the prince leaned back in his chair, "What about it?"



"Is sugarcane very expensive?"



"No... just ordinary crops."

"I heard that in the capital, a tiny bottle of perfume the size of a thumb can sell for five Gold royals," Carter scratched his head, "If that's true, wouldn't making perfume from sugarcane bring in a hefty income for the town?"

"Five Gold royals?" Roland was taken aback, as he had not considered this. Recalling his time in the palace, the Fourth Prince never cared about the price of daily necessities, and he had even less contact with something like perfume—it was only women who favored these fragrant items.

His initial motive for making perfume was simply to obtain scented soap. Otherwise, having only running water and no soap in the bathroom always felt lacking; it's the bubbles that add romance to a bath.

If a small bottle of perfume could also sell for several Gold royals, that would indeed be a good business. Unlike coated mirrors, sugarcane and flowers as raw materials were much cheaper than crystal glass.

With that in mind, Roland smiled and said, "That's a good idea, I'll consider it."

"Your Highness, then... may I take a sugarcane stalk out of the castle?" the Chief Knight asked with anticipation.

"Go ahead," hearing his tone, Roland guessed what the other person wanted to do—after all, the West is not like Clearwater Harbor, where bay plants are quite rare, and using it as a gift to please a lady was a good choice, "It's on the wall in the backyard, just go and pick it yourself."

"Thank you, Your Highness!" Carter bowed and took his leave.



Afterwards, Roland summoned Barov — it was no longer quite appropriate to call him the assistant minister. As the head of the City Hall, he could be considered the chief administrator of Border Town.



Once Barov was seated, Roland briefly explained the matter of the perfume, "What do you think of this business? Can it earn a large amount of Gold Royals?"



He did not answer immediately, but widened his eyes and asked in return, "Your Highness, are you really sure that the perfume is made from that kind of sweet crop?"



"Haven't you also been given soap to use? The reason it has a fragrance is because perfume has been mixed into it," Roland spread his hands, "Its raw materials are indeed these worthless things. I just don't know if the perfumes in the capital are really as expensive as Carter said."



"Far more than that, Your Highness!" Barov said excitedly, "Perfume is a top secret product of the Alchemists' Association in the capital, with only about a thousand bottles produced each year, and only a small part of them are sold in the capital. Reselling to other cities in Greycastle can increase the price by twenty to thirty percent, and if sold to the Fjords and other kingdoms, the price can almost double. To prevent merchants from profiting from the price difference, the association not only tightly controls the price of perfumes elsewhere, but also personally appoints the merchants. If you can produce perfume, even if you only sell it to Redwater City and Fallen Dragon Ridge, you can reap substantial returns."



"I see." Roland thought, deserving of someone who had been an assistant to the finance minister for twenty years, Barov was indeed very knowledgeable about the prices of goods and trade situations. With this information, he also formed a preliminary plan in his mind.



There are many ways to make perfume, the simplest is to crush petals or herbs with unique fragrances into alcohol, allowing the alcohol to dissolve the aromatic oils in the plants, then filtering out the residue, and diluting with water before use.



The alcohol comes from fermented sugarcane juice; the raw materials for the aromatic oils could be roses or more common herbs like rosemary and fragrant grass. However, since mass production was the goal, cultivating a batch of magic-modified plants that could directly secrete aromatic oils was the best choice.



In addition to perfume, this industry could also produce white sugar and spirits, which are also consumables with a high demand. Although the profit was not as high as perfume, if it could be sold to the townspeople at a low price, enriching their recipes, it would also be a great improvement for the people's livelihood.



The reason why Roland has been slow to develop light industry is that, with a shortage of manpower, small-scale production of daily necessities is unlikely to generate high profits. It is most cost-effective to invest the limited population in heavy industry production.

Since producing perfume is profitable, perhaps he could take this opportunity to fill this missing link.
