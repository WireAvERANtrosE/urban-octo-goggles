## Early Warning
Since the end of the Evil Months, the Western Territory had seen only two rainfalls, and the rest of the time was blessed with bright sunshine, as if to compensate for what the entire winter owed. The office was also free from the previous musty smell, the air became fresh and natural, and opening the window, one could occasionally catch a whiff of a light fragrance drifting in from the garden.



By now, the road between the town and Longsong Stronghold had basically been restored to its original state, and Roland had become particularly attentive to the movements of the stronghold.



Based on the situation last year, once the road traffic was restored, merchants would soon travel to Border Town to sell daily goods, but so far, he had not seen a single merchant from Longsong Stronghold. Lightning conducted two reconnaissance missions daily to ensure that the town was well-prepared before the enemy arrived.



In the past week, the First Army had entered the comprehensive drill phase, which included two parts: defensive line engagement and field pursuit. The former mainly relied on Lightning to report the enemy's distance from the air, with artillery and gun squads shooting as instructed—this part was relatively easy, as both the instructions and corresponding actions were clear and straightforward. For example, solid shot cannon fire at eight hundred meters and five hundred meters, grapeshot cannon fire after closing to three hundred meters, and musket fire within fifty meters, etc. As long as the commanders saw the flag raised by Lightning, they would notify their troops on how to attack.



The key was the field pursuit phase. According to Roland's plan, after the enemy was defeated, they would retreat back to the stronghold and, just like on the way there, it would take three days. Even if they abandoned the militia and mercenaries and returned alone, it would take no less than two days, so the enemy would definitely have to camp in the wilderness. This gave the First Army the opportunity to pursue. With Lightning maintaining constant surveillance, the First Army would follow within a safe area undetected by scouts, while cannons and ammunition were transported by the "Littletown." When the enemy set up camp for the night, the troops would complete the encirclement and then launch a pincer attack at dawn to annihilate the enemy.



The plan looked straightforward, but without wireless communication, splitting the troops and then coordinating a combined attack was almost impossible. Roland could only rely on witches to fill in for the communication gap in this segment. He was not sure about the final outcome.



Another issue was the dwindling supply of gunpowder, which meant that live-fire shooting was not carried out during the comprehensive drill phase. Instead, the main focus was on the coordination between the gun squads and artillery teams, as well as cooperation between the First Army and the witches. He had already sent people to Dragon Cliffs City and Redwater City, hoping to find more sources of saltpeter there. If gunpowder could not be replenished in time, after two battles, the muskets in the hands of the First Army would only serve as pikes.



Roland wrote down some new procurement plans on paper, including saltpeter, food, seeds, and other materials, intending to send another apprentice dispatched by Barov to try their luck in the capital of Greycastle. The goods there were plentiful, especially saltpeter—as summer approached, the capital's saltpeter production sites would definitely be operating at full capacity. As a city with a large number of nobles and wealthy merchants, the consumption of saltpeter would be astonishing once the weather turned hot. He hoped to find a stable supplier to provide Border Town with a steady supply of gunpowder ingredients.



Before that, he had already sent out two bodyguards to implement the "Witch Recruitment" and "Seeking Fruit" plans. The former usually disguised themselves as travelers or merchants, spreading rumors in streets and alleys, taverns, and black markets that Border Town was sheltering witches. Of course, the shelter was not provided by the Fourth Prince Roland but by the Mutual Aid Society, which had finally found the Holy Mountain and hoped that witches would settle there. The latter went directly to Clearwater Port to purchase exotic crop seeds from across the fjords. Of course, if any rare agricultural crops were found in the cities they passed through, their seeds would be brought back as well.



After finishing the purchase order, he handed it to Scroll and asked her to take it to the City Hall and hand it over to Barov. After Scroll left in response, Roland stretched lazily, wanting to take a sip of water, only to find that his cup was already empty.

Just as he was about to get up to get the kettle, Nightingale had already brought it over to his desk. Not only that, she smiled as she filled his cup and then took the kettle back.

Roland slowly took a sip, utterly baffled. Recently, Nightingale's attitude had been somewhat off, always smiling at him and even taking the initiative to pour him tea and water—was she angling for a raise? In the past, she would just plop down on the sofa with a basin of dried fish and munch away the entire afternoon.

Although Roland had asked her about it, she only responded with a smile, so he simply let it be.

Could it be that the Quint card game could indeed fill one with joy? If he were to also introduce poker and mahjong and open a casino, he could just sit back and rake in the money... Hold on, Roland shook his head, pushing these stray thoughts to the back of his mind. It was not the time to indulge in pleasures; he had to consider the matters after taking down the stronghold.

To relocate the administrative center to Longsong Stronghold? Roland pondered this for a long time. Moving to a more prosperous place seemed tempting, but in reality, it was not a good choice. The stronghold, unlike Border Town, had been established for over a century, with deeply entangled powers and nobles aplenty. Territories were managed by a feudal system, and even the lord of the stronghold would find it difficult to meddle in other territories. To fully transform it into his own domain without sparking a revolution was nearly impossible. Not to mention the security risks in such a chaotic place; he had no desire to be taken out by an arrow from some radical noble while walking the streets.

Border Town, on the other hand, was different. He had absolute authority over the territory, surrounded by vast lands with no urgent need for expansion. Its people were mostly miners and hunters, a homogenous composition, and after successfully defending against the Evil Months, his reputation in the area had soared. More importantly, through the ideological propaganda of the First Army, which was entirely composed of common people, most of the citizens had accepted the existence of witches. Compared to the citizens of Longsong Stronghold or other districts under the deep influence of the Church, the town could easily develop into a sanctuary for witches. Therefore, Roland still decided to make the town his core area.

As for the stronghold, he could support someone else to manage it on his behalf, as long as it could continuously provide him with a labor force and tax revenue. What he was most in need of right now were people and money.

Roland's initial idea was to use the money from Longsong Stronghold to hire the people of Longsong Stronghold to contribute to the development of Border Town. These Gold royals scavenged from the defeated nobles would return to the hands of the people, then be collected through taxes to the stronghold, and after being handed over to him, he would spend it again. Besides, he could retain some individuals with special skills in the town for the long term through certain favorable policies.



However, these were still only a rough framework. For example, decisions about who to support as the acting manager and the specific tax policies would have to be considered after the battle was over.



Just at that moment, a yellow figure flew in through the window and landed steadily in front of the prince's desk—it was Lightning.



"You've worked hard, have some water," Roland offered her a cup. She took it but was too preoccupied to drink, exclaiming loudly, "Your Highness, they're here!"
