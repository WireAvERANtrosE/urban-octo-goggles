## Early Warning
Since the end of the Evil Months, there had only been two rains in the Western Region, the rest of the time was sunny, as if making up for what the entire winter owed. The musty smell in the office was also swept away, and the air became fresh and natural. Opening the window, one could occasionally smell a faint fragrance drifting in from the garden.

By now, the land route between the town and Longsong Stronghold had basically been restored to its original state, and Roland had become particularly attentive to the movements of the Stronghold.

Based on the previous year's situation, after the restoration of the land traffic, merchants would soon travel to Border Town to sell daily goods, but so far, he had not seen a single merchant from Longsong Stronghold. Lightning was conducting two reconnaissance missions every day to ensure that the town was well-prepared before the enemy arrived.

In the past week, the First Army had entered the comprehensive drill phase, which included defensive line engagement and field pursuit. The former mainly relied on Lightning to report the distance of the enemy from the air, and the artillery and gun squads would fire according to orders—this part was relatively easy, as both the commands and corresponding actions were clear and straightforward. For instance, solid shell artillery fire when the enemy entered 800 meters and 500 meters, grapeshot artillery fire after closing into 300 meters, and musket fire after entering 50 meters. As long as the group leaders saw the flags raised by Lightning, they would inform their troops on which method of attack to use.

The key was the field pursuit stage. According to Roland's plan, after the enemy was defeated and retreated, it would take the same three days to return to the Stronghold as it did to come. Even if they abandoned the militia and mercenaries to ride back alone, it would not take less than two days, so the enemy would definitely have to camp in the wild. This gave the First Army the opportunity to pursue. Lightning would maintain full surveillance, while the First Army followed in a safe area not detected by scouts, with the artillery and ammunition transported by the Border Town ship. When the enemy set up camp overnight, the troops would complete the encirclement and then launch a pincer attack at dawn to annihilate the opponent.

The plan seemed straightforward, but without wireless communication, splitting the troops and coordinating a combined attack was almost impossible. Roland could only invest witches in this link to make up for the lack of communication. He was unsure about the final outcome.

Another point was that the gunpowder reserves were running low, so live firing was not conducted during the comprehensive drill phase. The main training focused on the cooperation between the musket squads and artillery teams, as well as coordination between the First Army and the witches. He had sent people to the more distant Dragon Ridge and Redwater City in hopes of finding more saltpeter sources. If the gunpowder could not be replenished in time, after two battles, the First Army's muskets might only be useful as spears.

Roland wrote some new procurement plans on paper, including saltpeter, food, seeds, and other materials, intending to have Barov send another apprentice to the capital of Greycastle to try their luck. The goods there were very plentiful, especially saltpeter—as summer approached, the capital's saltpeter plants must have been in full operation. As a city with a large number of nobles and rich merchants, the consumption of saltpeter would be astonishing once the weather got hot. He hoped to find a stable supplier to provide Border Town with a continuous supply of gunpowder materials.

Before that, he had already dispatched two personal guards to implement the "Witch Recruitment" and "Fruit Search" plans. The former usually disguised themselves as travelers or merchants, spreading rumors in streets and alleys, taverns, and black markets about Border Town's shelter for witches. Of course, the shelter provider was not the fourth prince, Roland, but the Mutual Aid Society, which had finally found the Holy Mountain and hoped that the witches would settle there. The latter went directly to Clearwater Harbor to purchase seeds of exotic crops from across the bay. Of course, if there were any rare agricultural crops in the cities along the way, their seeds were also brought back.

After finishing the purchase order, he handed it to Scroll and asked her to take it to the City Hall to transfer to Barov. After Scroll left in response, Roland stretched and wanted to drink water, but found that his cup was already empty.
Just as he was about to get up to fetch the kettle, Nightingale had already brought it over to his desk. Not only that, she also smiled as she filled his cup and then took the kettle back.
Roland slowly sipped, unable to fathom the reason. Nightingale's attitude had been a bit off lately, always smiling at him and taking the initiative to serve tea and water. Was she hinting at a raise? In the past, she would just plop down on the sofa, clutching a basin of dried fish and gnawing away the afternoon.
Although Roland had asked about the reason, she only smiled and did not answer, so he simply let it be.
Could it be that the Gwent card game really brought such pleasure? If he later introduced poker and mahjong and opened a casino, it would simply be a matter of sitting back and collecting money... Stop, Roland shook his head, throwing the distractions out of his mind. Now was not the time to indulge in pleasures; he had to consider the matters after taking down the Stronghold.
Moving the administrative center to Longsong Stronghold? Roland pondered this for a long time, and relocating to a more prosperous area seemed tempting but was actually not a good choice. The Stronghold, unlike Border Town, had been established for over a hundred years, with intricate powers and plenty of nobles. The territory was managed by a feudal system, and even the lord of the Stronghold would find it difficult to intervene in other territories. To completely transform it into his own domain, a revolution would be nearly impossible to avoid. Not to mention in such a complex place, his own safety could not be guaranteed. He did not wish to be taken out by an arrow from some radical noble while walking on the streets.
Border Town was different. The territory was entirely under his control, surrounded by vast lands, with no urgent need for expansion. The people were mostly miners and hunters, a homogenous group, and after successfully resisting the Evil Months, his reputation in the area had soared. More importantly, after the ideological propaganda by the First Army, which was entirely made up of the people, most of the residents had accepted the existence of witches. In comparison to the deeply church-influenced Longsong Stronghold or other urban districts, the town was much easier to develop into a haven for witches. Therefore, Roland still decided to make the town his core area.
As for the Stronghold, he could support others to manage it on his behalf, as long as they could provide a steady supply of labor and taxes. What he lacked most now were people and money.
Roland's preliminary idea was to use the money from Longsong Stronghold to hire people from there to build up Border Town. These Gold royals, plundered from the defeated nobles, would return to the hands of the people, then be collected through taxes from the Stronghold, which would be turned over to him and then spent by him. Besides, through some preferential policies, some people with special skills could be encouraged to stay for the long term.

However, these are still just a rough framework. For example, who to support as the acting manager and the specific tax policies will have to wait until after the battle is over.
At that moment, a yellow figure flew in through the window and landed steadily on the table in front of the prince—it was Lightning.
"Good work, have some water," Roland offered her a cup, but she took it without drinking, and exclaimed loudly, "Your Highness, they're here!"
