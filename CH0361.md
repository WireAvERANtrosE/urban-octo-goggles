## Expansion
According to the records of street literature, the most important part of mass-producing nitroglycerin is temperature control. The exothermic reaction can easily cause the sensitive explosive to detonate. As long as the temperature of the large reaction vessel can be kept constant, nitroglycerin can be safely produced in batches.



In the laboratory, ice can be used to cool the mixture, but this becomes impractical in large-scale production — the endothermic effect of an ice-water mixture is limited. It is slow to cool in the face of a large amount of heat, quickly depleting itself, and is also very troublesome to produce. However, Agatha's Ice Coffin can easily generate temperatures close to minus one hundred degrees, which is undoubtedly an excellent guarantee for cooling the container.



Roland didn't know how reliable this information was, but it didn't stop him from trying one by one. In case of an accident, there was still Nana as the last line of defense.



Returning to his office, he wrote a letter of introduction and handed it to the guards, asking them to accompany Agatha to the chemical laboratory and deliver the letter to Kajen Sichi.



In the letter, he not only introduced Agatha's abilities but also fabricated a noble identity for her — a noblewoman from an upper-class family who had fallen on hard times — to encourage the alchemist to curb his temper and treat this witch, who could greatly aid the chemical experiments, with respect. After the guards left with their orders, Roland still felt somewhat uneasy. Kajen was straightforward, and Agatha was a proud ancient witch; he just hoped they wouldn't end up in an irreconcilable dispute.



As he was considering whether to visit the laboratory himself later, Scroll walked in through the door.



"Your Highness, the results of the second batch of general education assessments are out," she said with a smile in her eyes, "This time there are seven hundred and sixty-two qualified individuals, half of them are adults."



"That many?" Roland was delighted. Compared to the first batch of more than fifty children from Karl Academy, the fact that half of the graduates were adults this time meant that the night school training had shown results and also validated the various teaching plans developed by the Ministry of Education to address disparities in progress and different learning times.



"Yes, Your Highness, you have been promoting general education for almost half a year now, and this batch of students is generally under the age of twenty-five, so mastering basic literacy is not too difficult a task."



It probably has something to do with the text itself, Roland thought. If it were in Chinese, it definitely wouldn't be this fast, although he always felt that this worm-like script was as awkward as it could be.

When he began implementing universal education, he had no idea to what extent it would succeed—after all, this was the first time such a thing was attempted in Greycastle, without any precedent to follow. Following principles of encouragement and subsidy, he had lengthy discussions with the book merchants and formulated an educational program that offered classes for minors during the day and for workers at night, complemented by a series of incentives to entice workers to come and learn. So far, the results seemed surprisingly good.



Of course, all of this would not be possible without the dedicated management of Scroll.

"You've worked hard," Roland nodded.

"It's my honor to serve you, Your Highness," she bowed slightly.



As the oldest witch in the Witch Union, Roland found it difficult to discuss Scroll in the same breath as young girls like Anna and Lightning—Scroll always gave him the impression of being unhurried and methodical. In discussions, she could quietly listen to his thoughts and also bluntly point out his mistakes. Sometimes, he even felt like a junior in her presence.

Perhaps... she was born to be a teacher.



Roland shook his head with a smile, casting aside these thoughts.

In any case, with the addition of new forces, some long-planned factories were finally ready to start operating.



"Please call Barov over for me," he said enthusiastically.

...

The Chief Officer of the City Hall arrived at the castle promptly. Since he started working on the city construction, his workload had been increasing day by day. Not only was the bald area on his forehead expanding, but his wrinkles had also multiplied. However, there was no sign of fatigue or hardship on his face; his spirit seemed to be ever improving.



"Your Highness, are you looking for me regarding the recruitment for work?" he asked proactively, probably already aware of the news that a new group of personnel had graduated from the town.



"Yes," Roland nodded, "Taking advantage of this year's early Evil Months and Timothy's inability to harass the Western Territory, I want to expand the military size of Border Town to prepare for next year's war, and at the same time increase the number of workers in the existing factories."



"And the City Hall," he quickly added, "After the city is built, your territory will be five to six times its current size, and the City Hall staff must also be expanded to the corresponding scale to manage such vast lands."



"Don't worry," the prince smiled, "I won't forget about you." He pulled out a piece of paper and began writing as he spoke, "Out of the more than seven hundred new graduates, the City Hall will provide twenty percent of the positions, the Acid Making Factory will take forty percent, and the remaining will be absorbed by the Steam Engine Factory and the Bicycle Factory, with the latter needing at least one hundred people. The salary will be set according to the previous standards, with the Acid Making Factory getting a slight increase. Fill the required numbers as soon as possible."



As for the Soap Factory and the Perfume Factory, their main work was done by witches, and ordinary people only needed to repeat a few simple operations. They did not need to be literate to be competent, so they were not included in the list.



Roland believed that education could not only improve a person's knowledge and horizons but also enhance their sense of responsibility and sociability. The meaning of enlightenment lies in this. This is also why advanced factories need a large number of people with elementary education—a worker who has opened their social attributes understands the importance of cooperation, altruism, and self-discipline better than an illiterate ignoramus. This is crucial for precision work that involves complex processes and numerous steps.



"Yes, Your Highness," Barov replied. "How many more people does the army need to expand by?"



"At least a thousand, open recruitment to the newly promoted commoners and refugees from the Eastern Region," Roland instructed. "As usual, the City Hall will put out the announcement, and the First Army will be responsible for the review and hiring."



"A... thousand people?" Barov was taken aback. "That's equivalent to the current total number of the First Army, Your Highness. If they are all to be equipped with supplies and weapons up to the standards of the First Army, the expenses will be substantial."



"I have considered all these, just proceed with it."



Now that the crisis of the devil's invasion was imminent, he naturally could not proceed slowly as before. In addition to bringing the entire Western Region under his rule, the first thing to do come spring was to completely crush Timothy. As long as this opposing regime was eliminated, even without occupying other territories, the new city in the Western Region would become the true "King's City." Then, whether it was expanding the population or promoting trade, he could act freely without the limitations he faced now.



However, these plans did not need to be revealed to Barov for the time being; he only needed to arrange the financial allocation and material distribution.



After the City Hall manager left, a personal guard brought in new news.



Margaret's caravan had arrived.
