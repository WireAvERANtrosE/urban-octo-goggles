## Hydrogen Balloon Delivery
Three days into autumn, the Margrave Trading Company arrived at the docks of Border Town as scheduled.

This time, the caravan had returned to its usual size, with ten sailboats lined up in a column, steadily moored alongside the wharf.

"Your Highness, it is a pleasure to see you again," the Crescent Moon Bay merchant Gamor bowed and said, "Ms. Margrave mentioned that the first steamship has been transformed?"

"Indeed," Roland smiled, "However, to ensure the quality of the goods, it still needs to go through three to four days of trial sailing to test the reliability of the power system."

"I am looking forward to it," Malan clapped his hands, "It will take about as many days for the fleet to unload the cargo, so we can wait here. May I ask, Your Highness, if I could board the steamship for a visit during the trial?"

"Of course, it is after all a brand new ship, completely different from the sailboats of the past, and I will have to introduce you to how to operate it. But according to the schedule, all this is for tomorrow." Roland gestured for them to follow, "Right now, what's most important is to relax your weary bodies. You haven't had lunch yet, have you? I have prepared a lavish banquet in the castle's reception hall."

"Every time we come here, there is a delicious meal to enjoy," Margrave covered her mouth with a laugh, "I am indeed so hungry that my stomach is growling—those biscuits and jerkies are so hard they are like stones, utterly hard to swallow."

In this era, there was no reliable preservation technology, so dry food was indeed very dry and hard, which made Roland think of canned food. Once light industry developed, manufacturing all kinds of delicious and convenient canned food would definitely be the best choice for long-distance travelers and seafaring merchants.

...



After the banquet ended, Hogg patted his belly contentedly and said, "This bowl of mushroom soup almost made me swallow my tongue. It's as if I tasted the delicacies of the sea, stewed chicken, and pork bones all at once. Your court chef is truly skilled."



"I prefer the dessert that was served after the meal, the one called ice cream... right?" Margaret said. "I guess it's made with milk and honey, and then frozen into crystals using saltpeter."



"You have to add some butter and egg whites, otherwise it can't be made so soft and chewy," Roland added. "How's the supply of saltpeter this time?"



"Still just one ship," the female merchant shook her head, "The Alchemists Association is still buying up saltpeter in large quantities, and the Prime Minister has even sent out patrols to assist them in scouring the saltpeter fields for goods. A bunch of people who bear the name of sages are no different from robbers when it comes to forced buying. This shipment of saltpeter still comes from Redwater City."



"So most of the goods brought in this month are cleaning stones?"



"That's right," Hogg drained the white wine in his cup and refilled it, "Although there might be a bit too much, you personally said last time to try to get as much as possible, and I kept that in mind. Besides cleaning stones, there are also high-quality iron and lead ingots. Recently, apart from here, very few towns need these things," he sighed, "The mining business is getting harder and harder."



This is the impact of the civil war, Roland thought to himself, the purchasing power around the country is gradually declining. If this continues for another two or three years, the situation will likely be that of rising grain prices and widespread famine.



"By the way, has anything happened in the Western Territory recently?" Margaret suddenly asked.



"What's the matter?"



"The fleet on the way to the town encountered a large pile of... um," she paused for a moment, as if considering her words, "a large pile of floating corpses. They were dressed in tattered clothes, just floating on both sides of the river. Apart from the bodies, there were some broken planks and ropes on the water surface, as if some ships had wrecked. However, there are no reefs in the inland river, so I think..."



"Hmph, that was Timothy's fleet invading the Western Territory," Roland put on an indignant expression and briefly recounted the battle from a week ago, "They have received the punishment they deserved."



In order to prevent the clogging of the shipping lanes and the spread of disease, after cleaning up the battlefield, he called Anna and Lily from the town, one responsible for burning the damaged ships and the other for purifying the river water. The floating corpses that Margaret saw were probably those who had died in battle and had drifted away with the river before the fight ended.



"I see," the female merchant smiled. "It seems that Timothy is hitting a wall on both sides."



"Both sides?"



"And there's Grace of Clearwater Harbor—I've received the latest news that the unidentified marauders who attacked the cities of the Eastern Territory were Grace's subordinates. After plundering Seawindshire and Golden Wheat City, the Black Sail Fleet did not return to the harbor but continued northward along the coast, and no one knows where they ultimately went."



"Northward..." Roland said in surprise, "She left Greycastle?"



"It seems so for the moment. Timothy's men drew a blank at Clearwater Harbor, which is now a ghost town," Margaret stated. "Since he brought a lot of rats with him, this isn't really a secret in the underworld. Nevertheless, now the thorn in his side is only you, and future invasions of the Western Territory might become more frequent."



"If you also wish to leave Greycastle, Crescent Moon Bay is always welcoming you," Marlan interjected.



"Indeed," Garmor patted his chest, "The island there is big enough to fit ten Border Towns, and we are willing to offer it to you and your people at no cost."

But in exchange for the steam engine and the paddle steamer technology, right? Roland thought with an inward eye roll. Even if Greycastle became unbearable, the first choice for asylum should be Tilly Wimbledon. However, he only smiled on the surface and said, "Is that so? If such a day comes, I will consider it."

"By the way," he then turned to Margaret, "I've successfully made two of the scouting balloons you ordered last time."

"So soon?" she exclaimed in surprise, "Can you take me to see them?"

"Of course, follow me," said Roland as he got up.

...

In the extended backyard of the castle, there was a hydrogen balloon that had been fully inflated.

Its envelope was teardrop-shaped, wider at the top and narrower at the bottom, with a diameter of five meters at the top, made to the exact size of the prototype, capable of carrying an adult male into the sky. Both the envelope and the ropes were painted in sky camouflage, and paired with the observer's camouflage clothing, it could minimize recognition to the greatest extent.

"It seems different from the balloon we rode last time?" Margaret examined the new product closely.



"Because it can be used without witches," Roland cleared his throat and began to introduce how to use the scouting balloon to everyone, "The tail of the airbag has a movable valve, which can be filled with and release gas—It is precisely because it is filled with this alchemical gas that it can fly. The method of inflation is very simple, just connect the matching hose to the gas storage tank, and then turn the valves on both ends." After saying that, he demonstrated the process of deflating and inflating in front of everyone.



"How many gas cylinders are needed to fill a scouting balloon?" Margaret quickly grasped the key point.



"Five or six bottles..." This question made Roland slightly embarrassed, "It won't exceed seven at most." The main reason was that it was difficult to control the concentration of the dilute sulfuric acid used to generate hydrogen in the bottles. Distilling the sulfuric acid to purify it to 98% and then diluting it with water was too wasteful of the precious manpower in the laboratory, so they had to make do.



"This alchemical gas must be very expensive, right?"



"Indeed it is. It is difficult to preserve and full of danger... I mean, if handled carelessly," Roland coughed twice, "so the gas cylinders can only be stored for one year, and they must not be knocked, dismantled, or burned, otherwise there might be unforeseeable serious consequences." He paused, "The price is indeed a bit expensive, but rest assured, when purchasing the scouting balloon for the first time, the first batch of gas cylinders will be provided free of charge by Border Town, and you will also receive an additional piece of sky camouflage scouting clothing."
