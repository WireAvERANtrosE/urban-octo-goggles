## Hydrogen Balloon Delivery
On the third day of autumn, the Margrave Commerce Guild arrived at Border Town's docks as promised.

This time, the caravan had returned to its usual size, with ten sailboats lined up in a column, steadily moored at the jetty.

"Respected Prince, we meet again," the Crescent Bay merchant Gamor bowed and said, "I heard from Lady Margrave that the first steamship has been refurbished?"

"Indeed," Roland smiled, "However, to ensure the quality of the goods, it still needs to go through three to four days of trial sailing to test the reliability of the power system."

"That's really something to look forward to," Marlan clapped his hands, "It will take about the same amount of time for the fleet to unload their goods, so we can wait here. May I ask, Your Highness, if I could board the steamship for a visit during its trial?"

"Of course, it is after all a brand-new ship, completely different from the sailboats of the past, and I will have to introduce you to how to operate it. However, according to the plan, all of these are scheduled for tomorrow." Roland made a 'follow me' gesture, "The most important thing now is to properly relax your weary bodies. You haven't had lunch yet, have you? I have prepared a lavish banquet in the castle's reception hall."

"Every time I come here, there is a delicious meal to enjoy," Margrave covered her mouth with a laugh, "I am indeed very hungry now—those biscuits and jerky are as hard as rocks, and quite difficult to swallow."

In this era, there were no reliable preservation techniques, so the rations were indeed very dry and hard, which made Roland think of canned food. Once the light industry developed, producing various delicious and convenient canned foods would definitely be the best choice for long-distance travelers and maritime merchants.

...



After the banquet ended, Hogg patted his belly contentedly. "This bowl of mushroom soup almost made me swallow my tongue. It's as if I tasted the flavors of sea delicacies, stewed chicken, and pork bones all at once. Your court chef is truly skilled."



"I preferred the dessert served after the meal, the one called ice cream... right?" Margaret said. "I guess it's made with milk and honey, and then frozen into crystals with saltpeter."



"You also need to add some butter and egg whites, otherwise, it can't be made so soft and sticky," Roland added. "How's the saltpeter shipment this time?"



"Still just one ship," the female merchant shook her head. "The Alchemist Association is still buying up saltpeter aggressively, and the Prime Minister even sent patrol teams to assist them in scavenging the saltpeter fields. A bunch of people known as wise men are no different from robbers when it comes to buying forcefully. This shipment of saltpeter still comes from Redwater City."



"So, most of the goods brought in this month are lye stones?"



"That's right," Hogg drained the white wine from his cup and poured himself another full glass. "Although there might be a bit too much, but as you said yourself last time, to bring in as much as possible, I've kept it in mind. Besides lye stones, there are also top-quality iron ingots and lead ingots. Recently, aside from here, there are very few towns that need these things," he sighed, "the mining business is getting harder and harder."



This is the impact of the civil war, Roland thought to himself. Purchasing power is gradually declining everywhere, and if this continues for another two or three years, it will lead to a pattern of rising grain prices and widespread famine.



"By the way, has anything happened in the Western Territory lately?" Margaret suddenly asked.



"What's up?"



The fleet encountered a heap of...um," she paused for a moment, seemingly considering her words, "a heap of floating corpses on the way to the town. They were dressed in tattered clothes, just floating on both sides of the river channel. Besides the bodies, there were some broken planks and ropes on the water, as if some ships had hit a reef and sunk. However, there are no reefs in the inland river, so I think..."



"Hmph, those were Timothy's fleets invading the Western Territory," Roland feigned an indignant look and briefly recounted the battle that took place a week ago, "They have received the punishment they deserved."



To avoid clogging the channels and the spread of disease, after cleaning up the battlefield, he called Anna and Lily from the town, one responsible for burning the damaged ships, the other for purifying the river water. The floating corpses that Margaret saw must have been the war dead who drifted away with the river water before the end of the battle.



"I see," the female merchant smiled. "It seems that Timothy has hit a wall on both sides."



"Both sides?"



"And Clearwater Harbor's Grace—I've received the latest news that the unidentified raiders who attacked the cities in the Eastern Territory were Grace's men. After the Black Sail Fleet plundered Sea Breeze County and Valencia City, they didn't return to the harbor but continued north along the coast, and no one knows where she finally went."



"Going north..." Roland said in surprise, "She left Greycastle?"



"It seems so for now. Timothy's men drew a blank at Clearwater Harbor, which is now a deserted city," Margaret stated, "Since he brought a lot of rats with him, this matter is hardly a secret in the underworld. Anyway, now that you're the only thorn left in his side, his invasions of the Western Territory might become more frequent."



"If you also wish to leave Greycastle, Crescent Moon Bay welcomes you at any time," Marwayne spoke up.



"Exactly," Garmor patted his chest, "The island there is big enough to fit ten Border Towns, and we are willing to offer it to you and your people at no cost."



But in exchange for the steam engine and paddle steamer technology, right? Roland thought to himself with an inward eye roll. Even if Greycastle became uninhabitable, the first person he would seek asylum with should be Tilly Wimbledon. However, he just smiled on the surface and said, "Is that so, if there really comes such a day, I will consider it."



"By the way," he then looked towards Margaret, "the reconnaissance balloons you ordered last time, I have successfully made two of them."



"That quickly?" she exclaimed in surprise, "Can you take me to see them?"



"Of course, follow me," Roland said as he got up.

...

In the expanded backyard of the castle, a fully inflated hydrogen balloon was placed.



Its gasbag was teardrop-shaped, wider at the top and narrower at the bottom, with a diameter of five meters at the top, made entirely according to the dimensions of the prototype, capable of carrying an adult male into the sky. Both the gasbag and the ropes had been painted with sky camouflage, and together with the observer's camouflage clothing, it could minimize recognition to the greatest extent.



"It seems to be different from the balloon we rode last time?" Margaret examined the new product closely.



"Because it can be used without a witch," Roland cleared his throat and began to introduce to everyone how to use the scout balloon, "The tail of the balloon is equipped with a movable valve, which can be used to fill and release gas—it's precisely because of this kind of alchemical gas filled inside that it can fly. The method of inflation is very simple, just connect the matching hose to the gas storage tank, and then twist open the valves at both ends." After saying this, he publicly demonstrated the process of deflating and inflating.



"How many tanks of gas are needed to fill one scout balloon?" Margaret quickly grasped the key point.



"Five or six tanks..." This question made Roland somewhat embarrassed, "It won't exceed seven tanks at most." The main reason was that it was difficult to control the concentration of the dilute sulfuric acid used to generate hydrogen gas. Distilling and purifying sulfuric acid to 98% and then diluting it with water was too wasteful of the precious manpower of the laboratory, so they had to make do.



"This kind of alchemical gas is very expensive, isn't it?"



"Indeed. It's difficult to preserve and full of dangers... I mean, if not handled carefully," Roland coughed twice, "the gas tank can only be stored for one year, and it must not be knocked, disassembled, or burned, otherwise unpredictable serious consequences may occur." He paused, "Although the price is somewhat expensive, rest assured, when purchasing the scout balloon for the first time, the first batch of gas storage tanks will be provided for free by Border Town, and you'll also receive an extra piece of sky camouflage scout clothing."
