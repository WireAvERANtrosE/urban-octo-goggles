## Informant
In the grand cathedral hall, Priest Feryl looked down upon a farmer kneeling at his feet.



The man's originally robust figure was now hunched over, his hands trembling slightly, his skin showing an abnormal cyanosis. It wouldn't take half a day before these patches would turn into black spots, eventually spreading over his entire body—having only been infected today, he was considered quite strong.



"I recognize you, you live in the eastern district of Shishan, often bringing fresh wheat grains to the church," the priest said.



"You... remember me! That's wonderful, Your Eminence," he repeatedly kowtowed, "My entire family has been infected with the demonic plague, I, I need the Holy Spirit Elixir, I beg of you—"



"But what have you brought for the church this time? The holy medicine is not something to be given lightly," Feryl said unhurriedly, "It requires the exchange of a devoted heart."



"I, I was swindled out of my money by rats while trying to buy the medicine," Shishan trembled as he spoke, "Please forgive my insincere heart, I should not have sought shortcuts through the black market. Now I only have, have one last egg left, please accept it." He took out a round egg from his bosom, holding it above his head.



"Putting your hope in a black market full of deceit and injustice naturally leads to punishment, but the gods always extend a helping hand to the lost lamb who finds their way back. Only those who realize their mistakes will walk further on the pilgrimage," Feryl accepted the egg with a smile, "Stand up, God has forgiven you."



"Really?" Shishan asked incredulously.



"God's messenger never lies." Feryl gestured, and another believer immediately came forward with a box of elixir. He picked out four bottles and handed them to the man. "If I remember correctly, there are four people in your family, right?"



"Yes, my lord," he swallowed, holding the Holy Spirit Potion in his hands, bowing down to kiss the priest's shoes, "Thank you, thank you! I will dedicate my life to the Church, to the true God from now on!"

The onlooking believers were also moved by this scene, cheering happily for the addition of a devout member to the Church family.

When the cheers subsided a little, Father Felry pressed his hand down to signal everyone to quiet down, then loudly said, "Next."

...

The dispensation of the potions continued until dusk.

With the ringing of the hour bell from the King's City, Father Felry announced the end of today's ceremony and that it would continue the following morning, leaving the grand hall amidst the pleas and entreaties of the crowd.

Although he was somewhat tired, his spirit was still buoyant. Standing in the grand hall, listening to the people's earnest pleas and prayers, watching their eager attempts to please him, he couldn't help but feel as if he himself were a deity.

No, it was the Church itself that was like a deity, Father Felry thought. After developing the plague and the medicine, they could easily control the life and death of others, a power no different from that of the true God. He couldn't help but reflect that the best decision he had ever made in his life was to give up his family business and devote himself to the Church.

In the face of such power, no one could stand in their way. Wealthy merchants with their family fortunes? Nobles with high ranks and great power? In the face of death, they would all be willing to give up everything for a chance to live.



Back in the resting area of the rear hall, a priest hurried up to him and whispered in his ear, "My lord, a rat has reported a situation."

"About what?"

"Refugees from the Eastern Region, he insists on speaking with you in person before he'll divulge the specifics," the priest replied.



According to the Church's previous instructions, Farry should make full use of the demonic plague and the antidote to convert as many believers for Hermes as possible, so attracting refugees was also part of his plan. However, compared to the citizens of the capital, they weren't as high a priority. He had intended to wait another two or three days until half of these homeless wanderers had perished from illness before going out of the city to provide aid, at the same time allowing them to fill the vacancies in the capital. In this way, a grand royal city would have ninety percent of its population as believers of the Church. With such an achievement, coupled with his previous efforts in the Battle of Succession, he might well be able to take a step further and ascend to the position of bishop.



At least in terms of rewarding meritorious service, the Church was very fair, never considering the bloodline or status of those who had contributed. As long as one performed outstandingly, promotion was assured.



Could there be some problem among the refugees?



Suppressing the doubts in his heart, he said without changing his expression, "Take him to the secret chamber. I will be there shortly."

"Yes, my lord."



Farry took off his priestly robe and took out a piece of soft armor from the wardrobe to put on, then draped a loose coat over it. After a brief tidying up in front of the silver mirror, he made his way to the secret chamber.



In the small room located in the basement, the priest saw the "informer"—hair disheveled, complexion sallow, and the shape of the bones could be seen with one glance at the thin arms. However, what was strange was that there were no symptoms of black spots on him.



"Your Excellency, my name is Pinhole," the other party immediately knelt down upon seeing the priest, "I have important intelligence to report to you."



"Go ahead."



"But..." He lifted his head, glanced at the other two people in the secret chamber, and hesitated.



"There's no need to worry, this is Priest Shatas, my trusted aide," Feryl said, "The other is Granny Brown Tooth, who is responsible for managing this secret chamber and hardly ever leaves this place."



"Then I will speak, but you once promised—"



"The potion is here," he said impatiently, taking out a small blue bottle and shaking it, "As long as your information is valuable, I will naturally cure your demonic plague."



"Your Excellency, I guarantee that this information is absolutely shocking," Pinhole raised his head and said, "Someone is continuously transporting refugees, there are empty ships all over the canal, this is what I have seen with my own eyes. I fear that in a few days, they will be able to take all the refugees away."



"Take away those with the black spot disease?" Feryl frowned, "Are you sure you saw correctly?"



He had previously received news that a fleet had taken in refugees from the Eastern Region, but this was normal—nobles from various regions liked to take advantage of disasters or misfortunes in other territories to recruit labor at very low costs. After all, once the demonic plague struck, those fools would naturally be punished by the gods. But now... why would someone knowingly take in refugees during an outbreak of the demonic plague?



"No, they have a way to cure the demonic plague! Those mercenaries gave the sick a bag of strange water to drink, and their black spots quickly faded. Some people even claimed that they came from the Western Region, and as long as the refugees followed the fleet, they would receive food, shelter, and remuneration." Pin said, pausing for a moment, "The most incredible thing is, there are witches among these people!"



"What did you say?"



"It's absolutely true, my lord!" he exclaimed, "I mingled with the refugee group and went aboard the ship. At first, I didn't notice anything until someone jumped off the ship to escape. The mercenaries onshore quickly gave chase, and that's when I noticed the circling dark shadow in the sky was not a bird, but a flying witch. I was so scared I didn't dare to move, not until the sailboat had traveled several miles away and I could no longer see the witch, did I find the chance to jump into the water and escape. It took me almost a day to return." Pin rubbed his hands together, "My lord, do you think this information is worth trading for a bottle of God's Punishment Potion?"



"Wait, you said they have a way to treat the demonic plague, and you also drank the potion, meaning you're not sick right now?" asked Duke Fariel.



"Uh... yes, that's correct, but didn't you say that any valuable information could—" Pin said awkwardly, his smile revealing a mouthful of uneven yellow teeth.



So that's it, he thought of selling this God's Punishment Potion, which he no longer needed, on the black market, Duke Fariel pondered for a moment, "How many people do they have? Are you sure they are all mercenaries hired by the caravan?"



"That's right, they don't have armor or horses, and their weapons are wooden pole spears. As for the number..." Pin scratched his head, "No more than a hundred people!"



"And the ships? Which family do they belong to?"



"...I'm not sure about that, most ships didn't have flags, and even if they did, I wouldn't be able to recognize them. Anyway, the mercenary said in person that the fleet would head to the Western Region. Ah... right, he also mentioned that this is a recruitment by the Lord of Border Town," he racked his brains to recall, "It seems to be for the reclamation of land, the lord needs to shelter a large number of people. That's all I can remember."



"Very well, that is indeed very important intelligence," the priest took a deep breath after listening, and pulled out the bottle of blue potion from his bosom, tossing it towards the informant, "Take it, it's yours now."



"Th-thank you, my lord!" The latter fumbled to catch the bottle, suddenly trembling all over, his eyes wide open. A slender short sword had pierced through his neck, its tip emitting a faint cold light, and standing behind him was the aged and decrepit manager of the secret chamber.
