## Informant
In the grand cathedral hall, Priest Feryl looked down at a farmer kneeling at his feet.

Once a robust figure, the farmer was now hunched over, his hands trembling slightly, his skin showing unnatural shades of blue and purple. It wouldn't take half a day for these patches to coalesce into black spots and eventually spread throughout his body—being infected only today, he was considered quite strong.

"I recognize you, living in the East district by the rocky hills, often bringing fresh wheat grains to the church," the priest spoke.

"You... remember me! That's wonderful, Your Eminence," he said, bowing repeatedly, "My whole family has been infected with the demonic plague, I... I need the Holy Spirit Elixir, please—"

"But what have you brought for the church this time? The sacred medicine is not something to be given out at will," Feryl said slowly, "It requires you to exchange with a sincere heart."

"I... I've been swindled out of my money by rats trying to buy the medicine," Stone Mountain said, trembling, "Please forgive my insincere heart, I should not have sought a shortcut through the black market. Now all I have left... left is this last egg, please accept it." He took out a round egg from his bosom and held it above his head.

"Placing hope in a black market full of deceit and injustice naturally leads to punishment, but the gods always extend a helping hand to the lost sheep who find their way back. Only those who realize their mistakes will walk ever further on the pilgrimage," Feryl took the egg and smiled, "Rise, God has forgiven you."

"Really?" Stone Mountain said in disbelief.

"The messenger of God never lies." Feryl gestured, and another believer immediately stepped forward with a box of potion. He picked out four bottles and handed them over. "If I remember correctly, there are four people in your family, right?"



"Yes, my lord," he swallowed, holding the Holy Potion in his hands, and bowed to kiss the priest's shoes, "Thank you, thank you! I will dedicate my life to the Church, to the true God from now on!"

The onlooking believers were also moved by this scene, and they cheered, happy for the Church family to gain a new devout member.

When the cheering abated, Father Felry gestured with his hand for silence and then announced loudly, "Next."

...

This medicine distribution ceremony continued until dusk.

With the tolling of the city bells marking the hour, Priest Felry declared the end of today's ceremony, saying it would continue tomorrow morning, and, amid the pleas and entreaties of the crowd, he left the great hall.

Though his body was somewhat weary, his spirits were still high. Standing in the great hall, listening to the earnest pleas and prayers of the people, watching them eagerly trying to please him, he couldn't help but feel as if he himself were divine.

No, it was the Church itself that was like a deity, Felry thought. Having developed the plague and the medicine, the Church could easily control the life and death of others, a power indistinguishable from that of a true God. He couldn't help but reflect that the best decision he had ever made in his life was to give up his family business and devote himself to the Church.

In the face of such power, no one could stand in the way. Wealthy merchants with their fortunes? Nobles with power and influence? Faced with death, they would all be willing to give up everything for a chance to live.



Returning to the resting area in the back hall, a priest hurried over and whispered in his ear, "My lord, a rat has reported a situation."

"Regarding what?"

"Eastern Region refugees. He wants to see you before he'll disclose the details," the priest replied.

According to the church's previous instructions, Farry should make full use of the demonic plague and the antidote, converting as many believers for Hermes as possible. Thus, drawing in refugees was also part of his plan, though they were not as important as the citizens of the capital. He had intended to wait another two or three days until half of these homeless wanderers had died of disease before going out of the city to provide relief, at the same time having them fill the vacancies in the capital. In this way, nine-tenths of the population of the grand royal city would become believers of the church. With such an achievement, coupled with the earlier battle for the throne, it might be enough for him to take a step further and ascend to the position of bishop.

At least in terms of rewarding merit, the church was very fair, never considering the lineage or status of those who contributed. As long as one performed outstandingly, a promotion could be obtained.

Could there be some problem with the refugees?

He suppressed the doubts in his heart and said calmly, "Take him to the secret chamber. I will be there shortly."

"Yes, my lord."

Farry took off his priestly robe, took a piece of soft armor out of the wardrobe to put on, and then covered it with a loose coat. After a brief adjustment in front of the silver mirror, he headed to the secret chamber.



In the small room located in the basement, the priest saw the "informant"—with disheveled hair, a sallow complexion, and skinny arms where the shape of bones could be easily discerned. However, strangely, there were no signs of black spots symptomatic of the disease on him.



"Sir, my name is Pinhole," the man immediately knelt down upon seeing the priest, "I have important information to tell you."



"Speak."



"But..." He lifted his head, glanced at the other two people in the secret chamber, and hesitated.



"There's no need to worry. This is Officer of the Sacred Leaf, my trusted aide," Phyllis said, "The other is Old Brown Tooth, who is responsible for managing this secret chamber and hardly ever leaves this place."



"Then I'll speak, but you promised—"



"The potion is here," he said impatiently, taking out a small blue bottle and shaking it, "As long as your information is valuable, I will naturally cure your demonic plague."



"Sir, I assure you this information is absolutely astonishing," Pinhole raised his head and said, "Someone is continuously transporting refugees. There are empty boats everywhere on the canal, which I have seen with my own eyes. I'm afraid it won't take many days for them to take all the refugees away."



"Take away those afflicted with the black spot disease?" Phyllis frowned, "Are you sure you saw that correctly?"



He had also received news before that a fleet was taking in refugees from the Eastern Region, but this was normal—nobles from all over liked to take advantage of disasters or calamities in other territories to collect labor at a very low cost. In any case, when the demonic plague struck, those fools would naturally be punished by the gods. But now... who would take in refugees knowing that the demonic plague was rampant?

"No, they have a way to cure the demonic plague! Those mercenaries gave the sick a bag of strange water to drink, and the black spots quickly faded. Some even claimed that they came from the Western Region, and as long as the refugees followed the fleet, they would receive food, shelter, and a salary," Pinpoint paused, "The most incredible thing is, there are witches among these people!"

"What did you say?"

"It's absolutely true, my lord!" he shouted, "I mingled with the refugees and got on the ship. At first, I didn't notice anything until someone jumped off the ship and fled. The mercenaries on the shore quickly gave chase, and that's when I noticed that the circling shadow in the sky wasn't a bird, but a flying witch. I was so scared I didn't dare to move until the sailboat was several miles out, and I couldn't see the witch anymore. That's when I found the chance to jump into the water and escape, and it took me almost a day to return." Pinpoint rubbed his hands together, "My lord, do you think this information is worth trading for a bottle of Holy Medicine?"

"Hold on, you said they have a way to cure the demonic plague, and you also drank the potion, which means you're not sick right now?" Ferlin asked.

"Uh... That's right, but didn't you say that as long as I found out valuable information, I could—" Pinpoint gave an awkward grin, revealing a mouthful of uneven yellow teeth.

So that was it, he wanted to take this bottle of Holy Spirit Potion, which he no longer needed, and sell it on the black market. Ferlin pondered for a moment, "How many people do they have? Are you sure they are all mercenaries hired by the caravan?"

"Indeed, they have no armor, no horses, their weapons are wooden pole spears, and as for the number..." Pinpoint scratched his head, "No more than a hundred people!"

"And the ships? Whose are they?"



"This... I don't know, most of the ships did not hoist flags, and even if they did, I couldn't recognize them. Anyway, the mercenary said that the fleet was headed for the Western Territory. Ah... Right, he also mentioned that it was a recruitment by the Lord of Border Town." He racked his brains to recall, "It seems that for the purpose of land reclamation, the lord needs to accommodate a large number of people. That's all I can remember."



"Alright, that is indeed very important information," the priest took a deep breath after listening, and pulled out the blue potion from his bosom, tossing it towards the needle's eye, "Take it, it is yours now."



"Th-thank you, my lord!" The latter fumbled to catch the bottle, his body suddenly trembling, eyes wide open. A slender short sword had pierced through his neck, its tip glinting with a cold light, and standing behind him was that aged and decrepit chamberlain.
