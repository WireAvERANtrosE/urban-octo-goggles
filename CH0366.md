## White Paper
After the heavy snowfalls of the Evil Months, the Redwater River became the only passable route throughout the Western Territory. 

Compared to the small sailboat I took before, the "Lionheart" was much more spacious and could accommodate a simple kitchen, allowing for hot food even while on the move. 

My bedroom was naturally the private chamber that the Duke once occupied, located at the stern of the ship, similar to the sterncastle of a sea vessel, through which one could see the flowing river and the occasional drifting ice floes through the window. 

"My lord, here is the egg soup you requested," the knight brought a clay pot and a porcelain bowl to my room. 

"Thank you," said Petro, nodding, "Take a seat and have a bowl yourself to warm up." 

Ever since His Highness the Prince sent all the knights from the other four major houses to Border Town and informed them that no ransom would be accepted, the first thing those nobles did was to send over the knights' families as well, freeing up land either to attract new knights or simply to take it for themselves. 

Only the Golden Flower family did not suffer much loss in this war and instead quickly grew in strength by acting as the agent for the Longsong Stronghold. Now they have firmly surpassed the four major houses and possess a fairly complete knight squad. The knight Seth by my side was a member of that squad, and although he was not as well-known as Dawnenlight, he was still considered quite outstanding among the young knights. 

"Yes," he smiled, lifting the lid of the clay pot and pouring soup for Petro, "But... are you sure this is a good idea, my lord?" 

"Are you referring to the witch?"



"Mmm, even though the church was burned down, it isn't difficult to build another one, and the church will one day return to the Western Region. You only need to push all the blame onto the Fourth Prince, and they won't have much to say. But you saved a witch in front of the people and arrested the church's followers..." The knight hesitated, "This is tantamount to openly opposing the church."



"If it's not difficult to build another one, why is that place still in ruins?" Petro blew on the fragrant egg soup, "The church will not return to the Western Region."



Seth blinked, seemingly not quite convinced by this conclusion.



As the steam from the egg soup subsided, he took a small sip, and with satisfaction, exhaled a puff of white breath, "As a regent, the most important thing is to understand the true intentions of the ruler. His Highness is promoting education in the fortress, employing new recruits trained in Border Town, and staging plays with obvious implications. Clearly, he wants to minimize the church's influence. Since I became the manager of the fortress for His Highness's sake, of course, I must follow his intentions in governing the fortress. If I can't even see this, I'm afraid he would immediately replace me with someone else." Petro shrugged, "Preventing the church from being rebuilt is just a matter of lifting a finger—the masons and carpenters must have received warnings, and even if there are believers who want to build it themselves, the rats will ensure these people can't start working."



"But the church—"



"Since the prince has done so, it means he is not afraid of the church's retaliation, or he is confident in keeping the church out. If they can set foot in the Western Region again, it would only mean that His Highness has failed. And if he fails, I certainly won't be able to sit in the main seat of the fortress castle any longer. You should be able to understand this logic."



"Do you think the Fourth Prince can defeat the church's army?" Seth asked in surprise.



"Who knows," Petro smiled and shook his head, "A year ago, I’m sure no one thought he could withstand Duke Ryan's knights." He stood up and picked up the earthenware pot, "I'm going to see how that little girl is doing, she might be hungry too."



The girl's name was Paper.

Without a doubt, only an orphan would use such a random name.

Ever since she boarded the ship, she had stayed silent in the cabin below deck. Even with her fingers turning red from the cold and her body shivering, she did not utter a sound. To be on the safe side, Petro had even put the God's Punishment Chains on her. After all, no matter how much His Highness preached that witches were no different from ordinary people, he couldn't fully trust someone with incredible powers to be just like everyone else—a careless act could potentially harm him.

"Why don't you get into the blankets?" Petro pointed at the hammock hanging in a corner of the cabin—space was limited on the ship, so the sailors usually slept in suspended hammocks wrapped in coarse hemp blankets. They weren't exactly comfortable, but at least they provided warmth.

"It will get dirty," she said softly.

"Sailors won't be any cleaner than you," he found a relatively dry spot to sit down, "The journey will take three days. Do you plan to just sit here the entire time? I'm afraid you'll die on the way before we even reach Border Town."

"Border Town?" Paper looked puzzled.

"Haven't I told you? We're going to a place suitable for witches to live." Petro opened the clay pot, "Come, finish the hot soup, and then get into the hammock."

This time the girl did not refuse. It was evident that she was really hungry; she hugged the clay pot and started drinking directly from it, not fearing burning her tongue.



Petro shook his head. Her body was as thin as a monkey's, her hair matted with dirt, and her clothes, likely picked up from somewhere, had several holes in them—judging by her appearance, she wasn't much different from the many other street children in the fortress.

"Who is that boy who protects you?" he asked. "A street child friend of yours?"

"Snake Tooth, he... often brings us... something to eat," Paper spoke with her tongue out after swallowing soup, her words muffled and unclear, "As long as I go with you, you... won't catch him anymore, right? He's not... a witch."

"Of course," Petro said expressionlessly, "he is of no importance." The phrase "often brings something to eat" surprised him a little; it was rare to find such a person in the slums, where the lack of food often led to conflicts over stealing—when one could hardly survive, there was little concern for others. And the name Snake Tooth... it sounded rather like the style of a rat.

With that thought, he couldn't help but ask another question, "When you said 'us' just now—besides you, are there other witches?"

"No," Paper shook her head, "everyone else is an orphan from around here."

This gave Petro some relief. "And what's this about using your power to remove snow that the old priest talked about? It's the first time I've seen a witch dare to use her powers in front of others."

"Snake Tooth suggested it," she explained. "He said I could help the residents quickly clear the snow off their roofs in exchange for some food, which would keep everyone from going hungry. The theater is always telling stories about witches, and now people are no longer afraid of witches. As long as I'm willing to work, he will negotiate with the adults."

So that's how it is, Petro couldn't help but curl his lips in amusement. This guy was quite interesting, knowing how to make good use of the resources at hand, but he seemed to be underestimating the influence of the Church a bit too much, "So did you get food in exchange?"



"Um..." Paper lowered her head, "I swept three rooftops, one family chased me away, another two gave me half a loaf of bread and a pancake. But when I got to the fourth one..."

She encountered that resentful old woman, Petro patted her head, "Once you’ve finished drinking, you should rest well. When it's time for dinner, I’ll have someone notify you."

Three days later, the Lionheart arrived at the Border Town docks.
