## New Visitor
Roland received his first procurement order for the steam engine since its manufacture, and the transaction amount was also the largest to date.

The price of a "bare engine" was 500 Gold Royals, with two units to be delivered in the first month, followed by an increase of one unit per month, totaling ten units. Additional Gold Royals would be required for future technical support, parts replacement, and equipment upgrades for the steam engine. As for high-quality after-sales service and three guarantees promise, Roland stated that he had never heard of them before.

Barov was the most excited about this transaction, in his view, any action that could increase the income of the City Hall—be it trade or plunder—was worthy of high praise. There were also dissenters, Carter, Scroll, and Nightingale, all raised questions about this, believing that it was too early to sell these immensely powerful machines to outsiders, as Border Town itself did not have enough for its own use yet.

Roland did not explain much about this, because he made this decision not just from the perspective of a lord, but from the position of an industrialization promoter.

It was almost an impossible task to push forward the industrialization of society by himself, even with knowledge that surpassed the times. The town's capacity to absorb was extremely limited, and if no one bought the industrial products that were manufactured, they were no different from scrap metal. It was necessary to get more people involved in this transformation in order to raise a new tide of power application.

What could he gain by selling steam engines?

Sufficient currency, a large number of job opportunities, and a batch of skilled workers—the latter being the most important of all.

This was also the reason why Roland kept production low.

After Anna's abilities evolved, her production efficiency was incomparable to before. As long as there were enough raw materials, she could now carve out a dozen steam engines in a day.



Selling such products is simply "selling" the machines themselves.

To drive this industry, it is necessary to form a specialized team responsible for production, assembly, and maintenance. In Roland's plan, he only needs to open a factory, prepare the production tools such as boring machines, planers, milling machines, etc., and entrust the production of the steam engines entirely to the workers. It can be anticipated that the factory's production efficiency will be low at the beginning, and the product qualification rate will be abysmal, but gradually, everything will get on the right track. With the master models personally crafted by Anna, as long as the operation is familiarized, the output will inevitably climb steadily.

Next, it is to use the profits from selling the machines to expand production scale and train more technicians. Experienced old workers will enable the town to produce higher-grade products, such as steam trains, steamships, and so on. Without a doubt, this is a virtuous cycle. And those sold steam engines will also indirectly create benefits for Roland—used in mining, they can reduce the price of ores; used in shipping, they can promote trade; used in textiles, they can make up for one's own shortcomings.

Roland couldn't wait for steam power to be rapidly popularized throughout the country—as long as all these machines were produced in Border Town. Once he unified Greycastle, he would save a lot of effort.

He also considered the possibility of the buyers replicating the steam engine, but the new steam engines would use round cylinders drilled with boring machines, along with some deliberately designed complex parts. Relying on the current level of craftsmanship, it would be difficult for them to produce qualified machines in a short time, even with high-temperature type witches.

Being able to talk about such a big order and finding a channel to sell industrial products should have made Roland overjoyed, yet he found himself not feeling the slightest bit of pleasure.

"The weather has already cleared up outside, why are you still frowning?" Nightingale propped up her long legs and sat on the desk, holding a plate of dried fish slices in her hand, "Are you still troubled by the news from the Church?"

When the books were not around, Nightingale's behavior became particularly casual, and the corner of the desk and the chaise longue by the wall were her usual spots. For other lords, such actions would obviously be an offense, but Roland knew he didn't mind, and she was equally aware of it.

"I've been wondering why the Church is supporting both me and Garcia in the fight for the throne, and now I think I've figured it out. If my guess is correct, Timothy must have also received an invitation from the Church," he said with a frown.



Besides the order, Margaret also brought him a lot of intelligence from the king's city, of which one thing greatly surprised Roland. That was the church's attack and takeover of the Kingdom of Everwinter, and according to the female merchant, it seemed they intended to go even further and launch an attack on the Kingdom of Wolfheart. This news was like a bolt from the blue, linking all the ominous signs that had been lingering in his mind.



"Supporting all three of you in the battle for the throne at the same time?"



"Not support, but to wear down," Roland shook his head. "The church does not care if war spreads throughout the country, or rather, they would be pleased to see Greycastle mired in internal strife. As for the church and its believers getting caught up in the war, that is not within their scope of concern. Greycastle is not as weak as Everwinter, with its vast territory and large population; if they were to launch a strong attack, the Judgement Army would lose much of its force. Only by waiting for us to finish off each other can they take Greycastle with the least cost. After that, they could have as many followers as they want and build churches however they like. Those pills... are nothing but traps they have meticulously prepared."



The decree of the battle for the throne issued by King Wimbledon III was essentially giving the church the opportunity to manipulate the situation. If Greycastle, Wolfheart, and Everwinter were to fall in succession, the sole remaining Dawn Kingdom would not be able to stand alone. The church's real goal is probably to unify the four major kingdoms. Considering the slow spread of news and the public's indifference to the political situation, it's very likely that by the time the enemy is at the door, everyone will finally come to their senses.



This was also the reason for Roland's anxiety.



In this era, there was no basis for establishing a united front, and expecting the nobles of Greycastle to come to each other's aid across borders was nothing but a pipe dream. When the church's army arrived at the gates of the city, the last force he could rely on would probably be the small number of troops from the Western Region.



"But you also have new weapons. The Judgement Army is not much stronger than ordinary knights, I think they won't be able to defeat you."



Roland remembered that in the past, Nightingale only felt fear when mentioning the church, this colossal entity. Now, to have such great confidence in himself was slightly beyond his expectations.



He forced a smile, but sighed in his heart. Producing the revolving rifles with Anna was not difficult, and the prototype revolving rifle and two revolving pistols that were manufactured performed exceptionally well, whether it was the trigger reset or the automatic cylinder. However, without solving the problem of bullet ignition, the new weapons would have no practical value. In the absence of having developed mercury fulminate, he had to use some substitute materials as primers.



Roland hoped that the guards heading to Redwater City would bring good news.



Just then, Lightning, who had regained her usual vigor and was undergoing daily training, flew into the office. She brought unexpected news—the flag on a mound in the forest east of Border Town had been changed to blue.



According to the secret rumors spread by Roland, a blue flag meant that a new witch had arrived.
