## New Visitor
Roland received his first procurement order for the manufacture of the steam engine, and the transaction amount was the largest to date.
The price for a "bare machine" was five hundred Gold Royals, with two units to be delivered in the first month, followed by an increase of one unit each month, totaling ten units. Additional Gold Royals would be required for future technical support, parts replacement, and equipment improvement for the steam engines. As for high-quality after-sales service and a three-package commitment, Roland indicated that he had never heard of them.
Barov was the most excited about this deal; in his view, any action that could increase the revenue for the City Hall—be it trade or plunder—was worthy of high praise. There were dissenters, however; Carter, Scroll, and Nightingale all raised doubts about the matter, believing that it was too early to sell these powerful machines to outsiders, as Border Town itself still did not have enough of them.
Roland did not explain too much in this regard, because his decision was not made solely from the perspective of a lord, but rather from the position of an industrialization promoter.
It was nearly an impossible task to promote the process of industrialization in society by oneself, even with knowledge surpassing that of the era. The town's capacity to absorb was extremely limited; without buyers for the industrial products manufactured, they were no different from scrap iron. It was necessary to involve more people in this revolution to set off a new wave of power application.
What could he gain through the sale of steam engines?
Ample currency, a large number of job positions, and a group of skilled workers—the latter always being the most important.
This was also the reason why Roland limited production.
After Anna's abilities evolved, her production efficiency was incomparable to before; provided there were enough raw materials, she could now carve out a dozen steam engines in a single day.

Selling such products is merely the act of "selling" the machines themselves.
To drive this industry, a dedicated team must be established to handle production, assembly, and maintenance. In Roland's plan, he only needs to open a factory, prepare the production tools, such as boring machines, planers, milling machines, and so on, and hand over the entire production of the steam engine to the workers. It can be anticipated that the initial production efficiency of the factory will be low and the product qualification rate will be appalling. However, gradually, everything will get on the right track. With the master models crafted by Anna's own hands, as long as the operation is familiarized, the output is bound to climb steadily.
Next, the profits from selling the machines will be used to expand production scale and cultivate more skilled workers. Experienced old workers will enable the town to produce higher-grade products, such as steam trains and steamships. Without a doubt, this is a virtuous cycle. And those steam engines that are sold will also indirectly create benefits for oneself—their use in mining can reduce the price of ores; in shipping, can promote trade; in textiles, can make up for one's own shortcomings.
Roland would be delighted if steam power could be rapidly popularized throughout the country—as long as these machines are produced in Border Town. Once he unifies Greycastle, he could save a lot of effort.
He also considered the possibility of buyers copying the steam engine. However, the new steam engines would use round cylinders drilled with boring machines, along with some intentionally designed complex components. Given the current level of technology, they would likely have difficulty producing qualified machines in a short time, even with the help of witches capable of withstanding high temperatures.
Securing such a large order and finding a channel to sell industrial products should have filled him with joy, but Roland found himself without a trace of happiness.
"It's already sunny outside, why are you still frowning?" Nightingale perched on the edge of the desk, legs crossed, holding a plate of dried fish slices. "Still worried about the news from the Church?"
When there are no scrolls around, Nightingale's behavior becomes particularly casual, with the corner of the desk and the chaise longue by the wall being her usual haunts. To other lords, such actions would clearly be offensive, but Roland knew he didn't mind, and she was well aware of that fact.
"I've always wondered why the Church would support both me and Grace in the fight for the throne, and now I think I've figured it out. If I'm not mistaken, Timothy must have also received an invitation from the Church," he said, frowning.

Besides the order, Margaret also brought him quite a bit of intelligence from the King's City, among which one thing greatly surprised Roland—it was the church attacking and taking over the Kingdom of Everwinter, and according to the female merchant, they seemed to plan to go even further, launching an attack on the Kingdom of Wolfheart. This news was like a bolt from the blue, linking all the ominous signs that had been lingering in his mind.

"Support all three of you in the fight for the throne at the same time?"

"It's not about support; it's about depletion," Roland shook his head. "The Church does not care if the flames of war spread throughout the country. On the contrary, they are pleased to see Greycastle embroiled in internal strife. As for the churches and believers being caught up in the war, that's not within their scope of concern at all. Greycastle is not as weak as Everwinter; it's vast in territory, with numerous people. If they launched a strong attack, the Judgement Army would lose a great deal. They can only occupy Greycastle at the least cost after we have fought each other to the last. After that, they can have as many believers as they want, and build churches however they like. Those pills... are nothing but well-prepared traps."

The decree of King Wimbledon III to fight for the throne was tantamount to giving the Church the opportunity to manipulate the situation. If Greycastle, Wolfheart, and Everwinter were to fall one after another, the only remaining Kingdom of Dawn would not be able to survive alone. The Church's real goal is probably to unify the four major kingdoms. Considering the slow transmission of information and the public's indifference to the political situation, it is very likely that by the time the enemy is at the gates, people would finally realize the gravity of the situation.

This was the reason for Roland's anxiety.

There was no basis for establishing a united front in this era, and it was a pipe dream to expect the nobles of Greycastle to come to each other's aid across borders. When the Church's army was at the gates, the only thing he could rely on in the end was probably just the small force from the Western Region.

"But you have new weapons now, and the Judgement Army isn't much stronger than ordinary knights. I think they can't beat you."

Roland remembered that Nightingale used to only feel fear when mentioning the huge entity of the Church. Now, to have such great confidence in him was somewhat beyond his expectations.

He forced a smile but sighed inwardly. It was not difficult to get Anna to produce the revolver rifle. The prototype revolver rifle and two revolver pistols performed exceptionally well, whether it was the trigger reset or the automatic cylinder. However, without solving the problem of the bullet firing, the new weapon had no practical value. Without having developed mercury fulminate, he had to use some alternative materials as a primer.

Roland hoped that the guards heading to Redwater City would bring good news. Just then, Lightning, who had regained her usual vigor and was engaged in her daily training, flew into the office. She brought unexpected news: the flag on a mound in the forest to the east of Border Town had been changed to blue.

According to the secret rumors Roland had spread, a blue flag signified the arrival of a new witch.
