## Flame Wall
"Are you feeling any better?"

Anna patted Nana's back. She felt something churning in her own stomach, but she managed to hold it in.



When the injured man was carried in, he was still conscious, repeatedly begging, "Save me, save me..." The despair and pleading in his eyes were heart-wrenching. Seeing the piece of intestine hanging out of his belly, Nana couldn't help but vomit.



Even so, she insisted on completing the treatment. After Brian helped put the intestines back into the patient's abdomen, Nana reached out her hand and healed the wound with her eyes closed.



"Umm..." The little girl looked somewhat listless as she leaned against Anna and whispered softly, "Today was the first time I heard the horn sounded. Has His Highness run into trouble?"



"I don't know." Anna shook her head. She really wanted to go over to the city walls to have a look but was afraid of causing Roland more trouble. She was now somewhat envious of Nightingale's ability to move silently and without a trace, which was very convenient.



Just then, a muffled sound came from the direction of the city walls, and everyone felt a slight tremor.



Brian stood up, pacing back and forth in the room with a restless look on his face.



"Relax, young man," Baron Pine said as he wiped his long sword, "Losing your cool before even entering the battlefield will only make a bad situation worse. Besides, we're far from the worst of it yet."



"Sorry, Your Excellency," Brian replied, "I just can't help thinking about the people fighting desperately on the city walls while I'm here wasting time. It's my duty to defend this town."



"Perhaps," Pine shrugged, "but defending the town isn't your responsibility alone. I've heard that His Highness intends to confer knighthood upon you after winter. Then you should understand more than ever that the foremost principle of a knight is loyalty. Since he needs you to protect Anna, you must fulfill that duty."



"You... are right," Brian hesitated for a moment before sitting back down.



However, soon they heard the second sounding of the horn—more urgent than the first, rolling like thunder over everyone's hearts.



Pine frowned.



"Anna!" Nana exclaimed.



He turned his head, only to see the witch walking straight towards the door, with Brian quickly catching up to block her path.



"Didn't you say you wanted to go defend the city walls? Now is the time," Anna said calmly, "As long as you come with me, it won't be considered a breach of His Highness's orders."



Brian was indeed stunned; he looked up, seeking Pine's gaze.



What a formidable girl, the baron thought, at least there was nothing wrong with that statement. Since His Highness the Prince had not specified that she must stay in the medical center. Moreover, Nana had mentioned that she could summon flames. If the situation was truly dire, the addition of a witch might well turn the tide.



With that thought, he nodded, "Protect her well."



"Yes!" Brian's spirits immediately lifted, and he answered loudly.



Seeing the two leave, Nana asked, "Father, aren't you going?"



"My battlefield is right here, my dear daughter," the baron smiled, "Whether it be demonic beasts or devils, I will not let them harm you."



Not far from the medical center was the city wall. Anna and Brian ran along the stone-paved path by the wall towards the east. When they arrived at the central watchtower, they realized the situation had taken a grave turn.



A huge breach had been made in the wall, and Roland's personal guards were holding up their shields at the front, but several had been knocked to the ground. Especially a demonic beast with tusks like a wild boar seemed unstoppable when it charged, sending the guards at the front flying, shields and all.



"Hey, it's dangerous here, get away quickly!" someone shouted upon seeing Anna dressed in her strange attire.



Anna turned a deaf ear and walked straight towards the breach. After the demonic beast broke through the crowd, it turned direction and charged directly at Anna. Brian, who was acting as her guard, quickly stepped forward to take a side position, lowered his body, and swung his sword in a horizontal strike—the frenzied demonic beast had no intention of dodging. Its foreleg struck the blade, instantly knocking the sword away, and the force of the body also broke the leg bone that had been slashed.



It screamed as it tumbled to the ground, flailing like a fish out of water, and for a moment, no one dared to approach. Anna walked up to the demonic beast, placed her hands on the ground, and flames immediately burst forth from beneath the creature, quickly charring it into a lump of carbon.



Roland also noticed the sudden rise of the flames, and when he realized that Anna had taken to the field herself, he broke out in a cold sweat.



This was not part of his plan!



He had intended to have Nana improve the militia's opinion of witches, and only after most people had accepted them would he reveal Anna's existence.



But now it was too late for any of that, and he immediately turned around and said, "Never mind me, go protect her!"



Anna absolutely must not be harmed; as a critical figure in replacing key industrial technologies, any injury to her would result in immeasurable losses.



"I understand," Nightingale said, "Please also be careful."



Anna walked up to the gap in the city wall, and Roland's personal guards, many of whom had seen this strangely dressed girl before, stepped aside to make room for her. She stood amidst the shield wall, extending her arms to either side. The flames, like vines, poured from the palms of her hands, climbing up along the face of the broken wall.



All who witnessed this spectacle gaped in amazement. They could hardly believe their eyes as a wall of flame slowly rose, filling the gap in the city wall. This was no illusion; the heat from the flames forced the guards at the breach to fall back, and the surrounding snow quickly melted, forming rising plumes of white steam.



The demonic beasts also felt the scorch of the firewall, scrambling to flee to both sides. Occasionally, one or two would stubbornly charge into the flames, but they would not run two steps before being buried in the fiery sea.



"All hands, to the walls!" Roland took the opportunity to shout, "Pike Team, reform ranks! Hunters, fire at will!"



Having said that, he snatched Carter's matchlock gun, ascended the battlements, and personally shot at the demonic beasts with nowhere to run.



The prince's actions immediately inspired everyone present. It must be said that in this era, it was rare for nobles or royalty to lead the charge. As the fourth prince of the kingdom, Roland's willingness to fight alongside a militia picked from the commoners brought a tremendous boost to morale.



Everyone shouted the slogan, "Defend Border Town! Fight for His Highness the Prince," maintaining the defensive formation as it was before the walls were breached.



The battle continued until dusk, and finally, there were no more living demonic beasts in front of the city walls.



As the light of the flames gradually faded, Anna wiped the sweat beads from her forehead and walked out of the breach.



Then, Roland saw an incredible scene.



The guards clenched their fists to their chests and bowed to her. Following that, the militia, as if infected, did not shout words like 'demon' or 'witch.' Instead, they silently watched her, and a brief tranquility emerged on the post-battle frontier.



A power that had never been seen before was indeed terrifying, but when this power stood by one's side, fighting against evil enemies together, fear would gradually dissipate, replaced by trust and gratitude.



Roland suppressed the excitement in his heart and walked over to Anna, only to find her complexion pale, her steps faltering, and her body swaying as if about to fall.



"Are you okay?" he asked with concern, gripping the young girl's shoulders. She gave the prince a weak smile, then collapsed into his arms.
