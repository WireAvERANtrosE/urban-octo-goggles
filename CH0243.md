## Establishment of the Intelligence Organization
After the moon had risen overhead, the scorching air gradually turned cool. Tassa sat in the garden, where he could see the twinkling lights from the windows of taverns, brothels, and gambling houses in the distance. Like the stars in the sky, they showcased the prosperity of the city.



Such a sight could only be seen in the inner city of the royal capital—even after the demonic plague had ended, with nearly a third of the commoners in the outer city dead, it did not affect the mood of the nobles in the inner city to drink and make merry. If one listened carefully, they could also hear the faint cries carried by the evening breeze.



The residence with a garden and a pool, which he had bought for one hundred and fifty Gold royals, was located on a hillside near the edge of the inner city, where few people loitered even during the day. Aside from meeting with informants and exchanging intelligence, he did not usually live here, opting instead to stay overnight in random inns or spend a few days in the Underground Hand.



"My lord, everyone has arrived," said a man holding a lantern, stepping out from the room. It was Hill Fawkes, who had been lurking within the Skeleton Fingers.



"Light the candles," Tassa nodded and walked into the house.



In the dim candlelight, Hill and five others were seated around a round wooden table. They rose and bowed their heads in greeting when they saw the personal guard appear. Tassa surveyed them expressionlessly, hoping to discern their reliability from their expressions and small movements. Regrettably, Miss Nightingale had already returned to Border Town with the fleet. If she were here, she could have made the most accurate judgments immediately.



They were Hill's companions, members of the "Dove and Top Hat" acrobatic troupe, and avengers filled with resentment towards the new king. It was precisely because someone hidden in the Dream Water had sent a message that Tassa had learned of the Rats' night raid plans a week ago at the docks. Now that the demonic plague incident was gradually subsiding, he decided to meet with this group in the royal capital. If they were truly as Hill had described, they would be good candidates for intelligence personnel.



"Other than Mr. Fawkes, let the rest of you briefly introduce yourselves," Tassa said.



"My name is Ironhill, sir," said the most robust man with a resonant voice. He was nearly six feet tall, and the muscles on his arms bulged with power. "I played the role of a strongman in the circus, and I have now joined the Bloodfang."



"I'm the Clown," said the short man sitting next to Ironhill, pointing at his own nose. He seemed to be the youngest of them all, around eighteen or nineteen years old. "Naturally, I'm the clown in the circus, but I haven't mixed in with the rats. Instead, I perform small tricks in various taverns."



"Joe and Neil," the next two were brothers, who looked no different from the typical commoners of the Outer City from their appearance to their attire. They had donated all their possessions to the Fertility Priests and were now "devout believers" in the church. Tassa couldn't help but wonder if both men had a fondness for Hill's wife. He suppressed his doubts and turned his gaze to the last person.



"They all call me the Magician, sir," the other man saluted again. "I originally pretended to be a disheartened person immersing myself in the Dream Water. Unfortunately, most of them are either dead or have fled, and even 'Ferocious Fang' Tanis was killed by the church's Judgement Army. Everyone is busy looking for a new master."



"Killed by the Judgement Army?" Tassa raised an eyebrow. "Aren't they the church's covertly supported force?"



"I heard it from others too," he spread his hands. "After failing to besiege the docks, Tanis was ambushed by the Skeleton Fingers on his way back to the Eastern District. In the end, he was left with only a few dozen men. That night he angrily took his men who stayed at the lair to find the church, and only two or three confidants returned the next day. According to them, he argued with the Fertility Priests, and then the Judgement Army ran him through with a spear... In any case, the Dream Water is finished."



So that's how it is, Tassa thought. Probably because the strength he had built up with difficulty was nearly lost, the leader of the Ferocious Fang was in a precarious position. He sought help from the church but was rejected, leading to the dispute and his death. However, these were all irrelevant details. He only needed to know that the Dream Water was now virtually defunct. This was undoubtedly good news, and he might take this opportunity to attract a group of rats with nowhere to go, expanding his sources of information.



"I suppose you have already learned my name from Hill," Tassa tapped on the table and said in a deep voice, "I am a personal guard of His Highness Roland Wimbledon, responsible for collecting intelligence from all over the kingdom. Since you have come here, you have in a way shown your intentions. But to make it official, I still need to ask one more time, are you willing to serve His Highness?"



"We are willing!" the five men said in unison.



"As long as I can get justice from Timothy Wimbledon, I am willing to do anything," Hill said, word by word.

"Good. From now on, we will meet here at the same time every week. If there is any urgent information, you can report to me in advance—just place a pot of purple flowers at the entrance of the residence," Tassa instructed. "When I notice it, I will wait for you in the room that evening. Remember to knock with the secret code of three long and two short knocks, understood?"

Seeing them all respond in unison, Tassa nodded in satisfaction. "A qualified intelligence officer will not easily expose themselves. The first thing you need to do is to hide your identity well. Whether you are gathering information on your own or developing subordinates to collect suspicious information, always keep this in mind. If you need money, you can apply to me... Remember, do not act rashly. Timothy will not sit on the throne forever, this is a promise from Prince Roland himself." He paused, "So, do you have anything else to say?"

"My lord, Timothy has returned from the Eastern Region today," Hill said. "You should have received this news as well."

The new king's knights had entered the city in the afternoon, with flags held high from the Eastern District gate, and many residents had witnessed this scene. Tassa did not respond, knowing that there must be more to come.

"However, just at dusk, I heard from Black Hammer that Timothy seems to be planning to recruit a group of rats to join the army, offering them the chance to become free people. Several leaders of the Skeleton Finger have already gone to the palace, and it doesn't sound like a fabrication."

Recruit rats? Tassa maintained his composure on the surface, but his heart sank. Clearly, these rats could not serve as formal soldiers in combat, so it was very likely another tactic of using drugged-up expendables in surprise assaults, just like the last attack on Longsong Stronghold. But this time, what was the target?

"This is indeed an interesting piece of news," he said gravely. "Remember to keep an eye on the movements of the rats and report to me immediately with any news."

Tassa hoped inwardly that Timothy Wimbledon wasn't heading for the Western Region.
