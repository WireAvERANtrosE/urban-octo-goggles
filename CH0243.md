## Establishment of the Intelligence Organization
After the moon rose to its zenith, the scorching air gradually turned cooler. Theo sat in the garden, where he could see the flickering lights shining through the windows of distant taverns, brothels, and gambling dens. In the night, they were like stars in the sky, displaying the prosperity of the city.



Such a scene could only be seen in the inner city of the King's City—where, even after the demonic plague ended and nearly one-third of the commoners in the outer city had perished, it did not affect the nobles in the inner city indulging in their wine and merriment. If one listened carefully, they could also hear the faint cries carried by the evening breeze.



This residence, complete with a garden and a pond, cost him one hundred and fifty Gold Royals and was located on a hillside near the edge of the inner city. Even during the day, there were few people loitering nearby. Aside from meeting with informants and exchanging intelligence, he did not usually live here, instead opting to spend the night in a random inn or stay underground at the Horn underground for a few days.



"My lord, they have all arrived."



A man holding a lamp walked out of the room—it was Hill Fawkes, who was lurking within the Skeleton Finger.



"Light the candles," Theo nodded and walked into the house.



Under the dim candlelight, Hill and five others were seated around a round wooden table. Seeing their guard appear, they all stood up and bowed their heads in salute. Theo looked at them expressionlessly, hoping to discern from their expressions and small movements whether they could be trusted. Unfortunately, Miss Nightingale had already returned to Border Town with the fleet. If she were here, she could have made the most accurate judgment immediately.



They were Hill's companions, members of the "Pigeons and Top Hats" acrobatic troupe, and avengers filled with resentment towards the new king. It was precisely because someone lurking in the Dream water had informed him that Theo had learned in advance of the rats' night raid plan during the dock siege a week ago. Now that the demonic plague incident was gradually subsiding, he decided to meet this group of people in the King’s City. If they were truly as Hill described, they could be promising intelligence recruits.



"Other than Mr. Fawkes, everyone else please introduce yourselves briefly," Theo said.



"I am Ironhead, my lord," the most sturdy man spoke first with a deep and resonant voice. He was nearly six feet tall, and the muscles bulging on his arms showed great strength. "I played the role of a strongman in the acrobatic troupe and have now joined the Blood Sail."

"I'm the Jester," the small man sitting next to Ironhead pointed at his nose. He seemed to be the youngest of them all, around eighteen or nineteen years old, "Of course, I'm a jester in the troupe, but I haven't mixed in with the rats. Instead, I perform some tricks in various taverns."

"Johm and Neil," the next two were a pair of brothers who, in both appearance and dress, were indistinguishable from the typical commoners of the Outer City. They had given all their possessions to the Fertility Priest and were now "devout believers" in the church. Theo couldn't help but wonder if both men were fond of Hill's wife at the same time. He suppressed his doubts and turned his gaze to the last person.

"They all call me the Magician, my lord," the other party bowed again, "I originally pretended to be a disheartened person and immersed myself in the Dream Water, but unfortunately, most of them either died or fled. Even 'Ferocious Fang' Tanis was killed by the church's Judgement Army, and everyone is busy looking for a new shelter."

"Killed by the Judgement Army?" Theo raised his eyebrows, "Aren't they secretly supported by the church?"

"I heard it from others," he spread his hands, "After Tanis failed to encircle the docks, he was ambushed by the Skeleton Finger on his way back to the East District, and in the end, he was left with only a few dozen men. That very night, he angrily took the men who were guarding the lair to find the church, but only two or three confidants returned the next day. According to them, he had an argument with the Fertility Priest and was then stabbed through the chest by the Judgement Army... In any case, the Dream Water is finished."

So that's how it is, Theo thought, probably because the power that had been so hard to accumulate was almost completely lost, the leader of Ferocious Fang's position was in jeopardy, and he sought assistance from the church but was refused, leading to the dispute. However, these were all insignificant details. All he needed to know was that the Dream Water was now practically defunct. This was undoubtedly good news, and he might take this opportunity to recruit a group of homeless rats to expand his own sources of information.

"You must have already learned my name from Hill," Theo tapped the table and said solemnly, "I am a personal guard for His Highness Roland Wimbledon, responsible for collecting information from all over the kingdom for him. Since you are willing to come here, in a sense, you have already shown your intentions. However, to be formal, I still need to ask one more time, are you willing to serve His Highness?"

"We are willing!" all five said in unison.



"As long as I can get justice from Timothy Wimbledon, I am willing to do anything," Hill stated, emphasizing each word.



"Very good. From now on, we will meet here at the same time every week. If there is any urgent information, you can report to me in advance—just place a pot of purple flowers at the entrance of the residence," Theo instructed. "Once I notice it, I will wait for you in the room that evening. Remember to knock with a long-short-short-long-short pattern when you arrive. Understood?"



Seeing them all respond in unison, Theo nodded in satisfaction, "A qualified intelligence officer will not expose themselves easily. The first thing you have to do is to hide your identity. Whether you are gathering intelligence on your own or developing subordinates to collect suspicious information, always keep this in mind. If you need money, you can apply to me... Remember, never act rashly. Timothy will not sit on the throne forever, this is a personal guarantee from Prince Roland." He paused for a moment, "So, do you have anything else to say?"



"Sir, Timothy has returned from the Eastern Region today," Hill said, "You should have received this news as well."



The new king's knight troop entered the city through the East District gate with their banners raised high in the afternoon, and many residents witnessed this scene. Theo did not respond, knowing that the other party must have more to say.



"However, just at dusk, I heard from Black Hammer that Timothy seems to be planning to conscript a bunch of rats into the army, offering them the chance to become free citizens in exchange. Several leaders of the Skeleton Finger have already gone to the palace, and it doesn't sound like a fabrication."



Conscripting rats? Theo maintained his composure on the surface, but his heart sank. Clearly, these rats couldn't act as formal soldiers in combat, so it was very likely another tactic using drug-enhanced expendables for a surprise attack, just like the last assault on the Longsong Stronghold. But this time, what was the target?



"This is indeed an interesting piece of news," he said gravely, "Remember to keep an eye on the movements of the rats, and report to me immediately if there is any news."



Theo hoped that Timothy Wimbledon was not heading for the Western Territory.
