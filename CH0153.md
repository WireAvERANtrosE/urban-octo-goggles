## Alchemy (Part 1)
Kyle Sichi walked into the Alchemy Workshop.

"Master Chief Alchemist." The apprentices bowed their heads in greeting upon seeing Kyle.

He waved his hand, "Carry on."

The apprentices crouched back down, busy with the tasks in their hands.

The outermost part of the workshop was the sorting room, where materials from all over Greycastle were cleaned, sorted, screened, and ground. The design of the sorting room was also quite ingenious, with stone flooring laid over a stream, the middle used for passage, and the murmuring stream flowing parallel to the stone path on both sides. Crossing over an arm's width of the stream, the outermost side was the cleaning area.

At a glance, the narrow sorting room seemed to be divided longitudinally into three sections by two streams. Light entered from the holes in the walls on both sides, reflecting on the stone floor and the water, forming long stripes of light that spanned the room. Light and shadow overlapped each other, resembling the pattern of a snake's scales.

Nearly a hundred apprentices leaned against the wall, processing the materials assigned to them. The debris that was lighter than water could be thrown directly into the stream, while heavier items were to be placed in baskets, taken out of the sorting room, and discarded. Cleaning with running water was also much more effective than using stagnant water in wooden barrels.

They would learn here for three to five years, until they mastered the sorting and cleaning of various materials, only then would they have the opportunity to be selected by an instructor as disciples and move on to the next room.

Kyle stepped on the interlaced patches of light and dark, entering the core area of the Alchemy Workshop—the Refining Room.



Pushing open the door, the view suddenly became clear, with twelve giant trees from the Misty Forest serving as pillars, supporting this extremely spacious room. Windows were cut into the stone walls on all sides, and even the roof was fitted with skylights and shades, making the room exceptionally well-lit. In the center of the refining room, there were six wide wooden tables, piled high with all sorts of alchemical apparatus: round-bottomed flasks, glass cups, balances, mortars, stoves, crucibles... Each alchemist was responsible for managing and using one table, and as the Chief Alchemist of Redwater City, he naturally used the longest table with the most apparatus on it.

The place was always filled with clutter and disorder, just like alchemy itself, mixing various ingredients together, heating, distilling, filtering, burning. The results were always unpredictable and fascinating.

If one could find a clear direction from these chaotic changes and put it into writing, it would be an extremely rare alchemical formula. Those who could create their own alchemical formulas could be called alchemists. So far, he had summarized more than a dozen alchemical formulas, each one as if whispers from the gods—Kyle believed that once alchemy developed to a certain extent, it could not only separate the essence but even combine all things.

"Chamis, how is your imitation of the snow powder coming along?" he asked.

A young man in his twenties came over, shaking his head, "Those damned Royal City alchemists must have added other materials to it; the powder is ground so fine, I really can't separate anything useful from it."

He was the youngest alchemist in the alchemy workshop—generally speaking, without long-term accumulation and trial, it was impossible to create an alchemical formula, and sometimes it even required a bit of luck. Many in the workshop had been disciples all their lives and struggled to advance further until death. Chamis, however, had an extraordinary talent for alchemy, and two years ago, he had devised a method to distill green vitriol to obtain acid, which earned unanimous approval from five alchemists, and since then, there was one more long table in the refining room.

"Don't worry, take your time," he said with a smile, patting the other's shoulder to comfort him. Having served eight years as the Chief, Kyle naturally understood the difficulty of finding truth amidst disorder and chaos, "But I did come up with something good last night, something to show those arrogant folks. Come with me."

He went to his table and had two disciples bring over a storage box—the box was about half a person tall, made entirely of wrought iron, not easily stolen, and difficult to damage. He took out the key and opened the first compartment, where a small piece of transparent crystal lay in the center.

"Cut crystal?" Chamis carefully held it in his hand, looking through it towards the sunlight coming through the window, "No, this is... crystal glass! My goodness! You've done it!"



"That's right," Kyle said with a proud smile, "I really want to see the look on their faces when those guys see their most prized alchemical product successfully replicated by me."



Chambers couldn't help but let out an exclamation of admiration that disturbed the other alchemists, who put down their work and crowded around.



"Is this the result of you staying up late last night? It's amazing."



"It's so beautiful, just like crystal."



"Congratulations. With this, our Alchemy Workshop's status in the Duke's heart will rise significantly."



"How did you make it? Can you tell us?"



Kyle nodded and said, "We all know that glass and river sand have very similar components. The reason glass from different places has different colors is because of the impurities they contain. The solution is either to remove the impurities or to find purer sand. Everyone has been trying in this direction, and so have I. The success of this alchemy is largely due to a stroke of luck. I chose the fine white sand from Willow Town and the sandstone from Dragon Cliffs City..."



The crowd listened quietly around him until he had finished speaking, and then the alchemists let out a sigh together, "So that's how it is, you've really thought this through."



Crystal is a rare and expensive gem, and colorless transparent crystal is even rarer. Only the cleanest and most transparent glass can be called crystal glass, and the capital's Alchemy Association relies on this product to firmly surpass the alchemy shops of Redwater City, earning an amount of Gold royals each year that makes the Duke of Redwater City envious.



Now, this situation was about to change soon. If Chemist could figure out the composition of the snow powder, coupled with the double-stone acid-making method, they would completely surpass the Alchemist Association of the King's City. By then, those fellows who only looked down on people with their chins would probably have to lower their heads, which were as proud as roosters. Thinking of this, Kyle Sichi's mood became even more elated.



Just as he was preparing to select the raw materials for the second batch of crystal glass, a disciple hurried over to him, "Chief Alchemist, there is a messenger from the Western Border Town who wishes to see you. He has brought a letter from Fourth Prince Roland Wimbledon."



"Fourth Prince?" Kyle frowned and thought for a moment. It seemed that there was indeed such a person in the royal family of Greycastle. He knew very little about the affairs of the nobility; in his impression, these people were both foolish and ignorant, only fighting over power and wealth until they were battered and bloody. "What does he want with me?"



"I do not know. The messenger said that as long as you read the letter, you will naturally understand His Highness's intentions."



"..." The Chief Alchemist showed a look of extreme impatience. The content of the letter was probably either a recruitment with a hefty sum of money or a reprimand for alchemy being a demonic trick. However, since the other party was a prince, basic etiquette still had to be maintained, "Take me to him, and after I get the letter, let him roll out!"



"Yes, Chief Alchemist."
