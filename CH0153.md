## Alchemy (Part 1)
Kam Surl walked into the Alchemy Workshop.

"Lord Chief Alchemist," the apprentices greeted him with their heads bowed as they saw Kam.

He waved his hand, "Carry on."

The apprentices bent down again and busied themselves with their tasks.

The outermost part of the workshop was the cleaning and sorting room, where materials from all over Greycastle were washed, classified, filtered, and ground. The design of the cleaning and sorting room was also quite ingenious, with stone floors laid over a stream, the middle used for passage, and the murmuring water flowing parallel to the stone path on either side. Across an arm's width of the stream was the cleaning area.

At a glance, the narrow cleaning and sorting room seemed to be divided into three sections longitudinally by the two streams. Light entered through the holes in the walls on both sides, reflecting on the stone floor and the water, forming long strips of light that stretched across the room. Light and shadow overlapped each other, resembling the pattern of a snake.

Nearly a hundred apprentices were lined up against the wall, processing the materials assigned to them. If the debris they picked out was lighter than water, it could be directly thrown into the stream; if heavier, it had to be put into baskets and taken out of the cleaning and sorting room to be disposed of. Using running water for cleaning was also much more effective than using stagnant water from a barrel.

They would study here for three to five years, until they thoroughly mastered the sorting and cleaning of all kinds of materials, and only then would they have the chance to be selected by a tutor as a disciple and move to the next room.

Kam stepped through the interplay of light and shadow and entered the core area of the Alchemy Workshop—the Refining Room.



Pushing open the door, the view suddenly became clear. Twelve giant logs brought from the Hidden Forest served as pillars, supporting the extremely spacious room. Windows were set into each of the four stone walls, and even the roof had skylights and coverings, making the room very well-lit. In the center of the refining room, six wide wooden tables were placed, piled with all sorts of alchemical equipment: round-bottom flasks, glass beakers, balances, mortars, stoves, crucibles... Each instructor was responsible for managing and using one table, and as the chief alchemist of Redwater City, the one he used was naturally the longest and had the most equipment on it.

This place was always filled with chaos and disorder, just like alchemy itself, mixing various ingredients together, heating, dry distillation, passing through water, burning. The results were always varied and fascinating.

If one could find a clear direction from these disorderly changes and write it down, it would be a rare alchemical formula. Those who could create alchemical formulas on their own could be called alchemists. So far, he had summarized more than a dozen alchemical formulas, each one seemingly a whisper from the gods—Kemo believed that, with the development of alchemy to a certain extent, it could not only separate the essence but even combine all things.

"Chames, how is your imitation of the snow powder coming along?" he asked.

A young man in his twenties came over, shaking his head, "Those damned alchemists from the capital must have added other ingredients to it. The powder is ground very fine; it's really impossible to separate anything useful out."

He was the youngest alchemist in the alchemical workshop—generally speaking, to create an alchemical formula, it was impossible without a long time of accumulation and experimentation, and sometimes it even required a bit of luck. Many people in the workshop had been apprentices for a lifetime and found it difficult to advance further. But Chames had an extraordinary talent for alchemy. Two years ago, he summarized the method of obtaining acid by dry distillation of green vitriol, winning unanimous approval from five alchemists, and since then, there was one more long table in the refining room.

"Don't worry, take it slow," he said with a smile and patted the other's shoulder to comfort him. Having been the chief for eight years, Kemo naturally understood the difficulty of finding truth in disorder and chaos, "But I did come up with something good last night. I can give those arrogant guys a taste of their own medicine. Come with me."

He walked to his own table and had two apprentices bring over the storage box—a box about half the height of a person, made entirely of wrought iron, not easy to be stolen, and also very difficult to damage. He took out a key to open the first layer of the compartment, in the center of which lay a small transparent crystal.

"Cut crystal?" Chames carefully pinched it in his hand, looking towards the sunlight outside the window, "No, this is... crystal glass! My God! You did it!"



"Exactly," Chemode said with a proud smile, "I'm eager to see the expression on those guys' faces when they see that I've successfully replicated their most prized alchemical product."



Chamis couldn't help but exclaim in admiration, drawing the attention of the other alchemists, who left their work and gathered around.



"Is this the result of your work late into last night? It's amazing."



"It's so beautiful, just like crystal."



"Congratulations, this will greatly enhance our position in the eyes of the Duke."



"How did you manage to make it? Can you share with us?"



Chemode nodded, "We all know that the composition of glass is very similar to that of river sand. The color of glass produced from different sands varies because of the impurities they contain. One can either find a way to remove these impurities or find purer sand. Everyone has been trying in this direction, and I did the same. The success of this alchemy owes much to a chance discovery. I chose the fine white sand from Willow Town and the sandstone from Dragonfall Ridge..."



Everyone listened quietly until he finished explaining, then the alchemists let out a collective breath, "So that's how it is, you've been very thorough."



Crystal is a rare and expensive gem, and colorless transparent crystal is even rarer. Only the cleanest and most translucent glass can be called crystal glass, and it is with this product that the capital's Alchemy Association firmly outstrips the alchemy workshops of Redwater City, earning more Gold royals each year than the Duke of Redwater City can envy.



The situation was soon to change. If Chemist could decipher the composition of the snow powder, coupled with the method of making acid with saltpeter, they would completely surpass the Alchemist Association of the capital. By then, those who only looked down on others with their chins would probably have to lower their heads, much like roosters. Thinking of this, Kymo Shtirl felt even more pleased.



As he was preparing to select the second batch of raw materials for crystal glass, a disciple hurried over to him and said, "Chief Alchemist, there's a messenger from Border Town in the Western Region who wants to see you. He has brought a letter from Fourth Prince Roland Wimbledon."



"Fourth Prince?" Kymo frowned and thought for a moment. There indeed seemed to be such a person in the Greycastle royal family. He knew little about the affairs of the nobility; in his impression, these people were both foolish and ignorant, fighting viciously for power and wealth. "What does he want with me?"



"I don't know. The messenger said that once you read the letter, you will naturally understand His Highness's intentions."



The Chief Alchemist showed an extremely impatient expression. The content of the letter was probably either a high-paying recruitment offer or a rebuke, accusing alchemy of being witchcraft. But since the visitor was a prince, basic etiquette still had to be maintained. "Take me to him, and after I get the letter, let him leave!"



"Yes, Chief Alchemist."
