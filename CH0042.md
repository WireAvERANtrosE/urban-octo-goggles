## Industrial Accident
"What happens if you get bitten by a demonic beast?" Roland asked, "Will you become like them?" 
He hoped it wasn't some kind of otherworldly version of a biohazard crisis, as their current technology couldn't extract virus antigens.
"Of course not," Iron Axe replied with an expression that read 'how could you ask such a question', "If you get bitten, you'll just become a corpse."
"What about their meat, can it be eaten?"
Carter exclaimed, "Your Highness! How could you eat such a tainted creature, they are all contaminated by the breath of hell!"
Roland looked at Iron Axe, who nodded, "Your knight is correct, I once cut off the flesh of a demonic beast to feed hunting dogs, but the dogs died shortly after eating it."
"Is that so? What a pity." Roland sighed. Food sources were very scarce in this era. If demonic beasts could be eaten, winter would be a bountiful month. Imagine, all the animals in the forest madly running towards Border Town, even saving them the effort of hunting.
After inspecting the city wall, he decided to pay a visit to Nana.
Now, the nearest noble residence to the city wall had been requisitioned by Roland for use as a field hospital, or rather, publicly declared as a medical clinic. To be on the safe side, this place had become the most heavily guarded area in the town, other than the city wall itself.

The owner of this place had taken away all the movable wealth when he returned to Longsong Stronghold, and since Border Town was a place that could be abandoned at any moment, this large house was devoid of any decorations, such as murals, carpets, or ceramics. If it weren't for the fact that it was somewhat clean, it would have looked like an abandoned, ownerless place. 

Roland had knocked down all the wooden partitions on the first floor, leaving only the corridors and entrance hall, thereby making all the other rooms into one whole. After setting up ten beds, a simple hospital was formed. There were no nurses, no doctors, and it was even less likely that all ten beds would be used - Nana's treatment didn't require bed rest, but had immediate effects. 

During the day, she would be on standby on the second floor of the hospital, and Anna would come to accompany her when she was free. Titus Pine and Brian were responsible for guarding the first floor, and two personal guards were arranged to watch the door, ensuring absolute security.

What Roland hadn't expected was that the first injured person to be admitted to the field hospital was not a militiaman defending the city wall, but a worker from the North Slope Mine.

...
Nail felt his hands shaking. 

Hearing the hoarse screams from Ironhead behind him, he quickened his pace again, wishing he could fly. 

It was all because of his negligence, he thought, cursing himself for forgetting Sir Knight's admonition. 

He regretted taking on the task of operating the big machine!

Ever since the installation of this big, pitch-black contraption at the entrance of the mine, the job of the miners has become much easier. The hardest part of their work used to be hauling the mined ore out of the cave. When the mining basket was filled with stones, it took three to four people to move it. Two would push from behind while the rest pulled from the front. The uneven ground of the mine, worn smooth by years of mining, made the task difficult. The iron sheet at the bottom of the mining basket also needed frequent replacement.

A week ago, the Chief Knight ordered Ironhead and his men to haul a pile of strangely-shaped metal parts up the mountain. After days of assembly, they formed a furnace. To Nail's surprise, once this furnace was lit, it started to move on its own. Not only could it move, but its strength was also vast. The knight stated it was an invention of His Highness, the Prince, called a steam engine.

By tying the hemp rope tightly to the mining basket and igniting the furnace, the big contraption would start to hum, turning the winch and rapidly hauling the mining basket out of the mine. It was truly incredible!

After demonstrating a few times, the Chief Knight asked Ironhead to select someone to operate the steam engine. When Nail was chosen, he was overjoyed. Just imagine; by guarding this machine, he no longer had to go down into the mines to dig rocks or push baskets. The last accidental collapse had given him quite a scare.

So, Nail remembered every bit of advice from the Chief Knight. It was not difficult: when the machine needed to work, one only had to raise the green lever and then push down the red one. The knight said that the green lever was connected to the intake valve, and the red one to the exhaust valve. This way, the steam would flow through the pipes into the cylinder. After the mining basket was pulled up, to stop the machine one simply had to operate in reverse: lift the red lever and push down the green one. The steam would then be released from a pipe at the side of the boiler. Water needed to be replenished in the furnace after every cycle. Although Nail did not understand what valves and cylinders meant, he agreed to every instruction.

However, the knight emphasized two things that must be noted. First, the order must not be wrong; the machine must be started with green first, followed by red, and shut down in the opposite order. If the order is wrong, the machine may be damaged. The second is that when exhausting, the miners around must be cleared first, and warnings must be shouted continuously until the red lever is fully lifted.

Nails had memorized the first point perfectly, and he wouldn't make a mistake even with his eyes closed. But the problem lay in the second point.

Today, as usual, when he shut down the machine, there was no one around. He thought that shouting warnings alone would make him look like a fool, so he went ahead to pull the red lever. The lever was a bit tight, and he gritted his teeth, using a lot of effort before he could pull it.

Unexpectedly, in the moment he pulled the lever, Ironhead appeared in front of the furnace - Nails swore that he didn't see where the miner had come from, and the loud rumbling of the machine covered his footsteps. White steam hissed out of the exhaust, hitting Ironhead right in the face!

Nails was startled on the spot, only to see Ironhead fall to the ground, clutching his face, rolling around, and letting out a shrill scream - a sound that made his hair stand on end.

Soon, other miners gathered around, holding down the rolling Ironhead, forcibly prying open his hands. His face was already a blur, blood seeping out from the cooked rotten flesh, his eyes turned into white beads. Everyone present realized that Ironhead was beyond saving.

Nails, regaining his senses, let the tears roll down his cheeks. Ironhead had always taken good care of him, assigned him less work because of his young age, but never shortchanged him on his wages. And now, his negligence had caused this accident.

In his grief and panic, Nails suddenly remembered what the knight had said, that if someone in the mining area was injured, they could be taken to the medical clinic near the city wall.

Even though he knew in his heart that such a serious injury could not be healed, the wound was too large, and herbs would not work, it would only continue to rot, then the whole body would have a high fever, and soon fall into a coma. But he still carried Ironhead on his back, ignoring the surprised looks of those around him, gritted his teeth, and ran towards the foot of the mountain.

If he did nothing and just watched Tielhead die, he would probably never be able to forgive himself for the rest of his life.
