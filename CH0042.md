## work-related injury accident
"What happens if you get bitten by a demonic beast?" Roland asked. "Will you become like them?"



He hoped it wasn't some otherworldly version of a biohazard crisis. With the current level of technology, there was no way to extract the virus antigen.



"Of course not," Iron Axe replied with a look that said, 'why would you ask such a question,' "If you get bitten, you'll just become a corpse."



"And their meat, is it edible?"



Carter exclaimed in shock, "Your Highness! How can you eat such evil creatures, they have all been contaminated by the breath of hell!"



Roland looked towards Iron Axe, who nodded, "Your knight is correct. I've tried feeding the flesh of demonic beasts to hunting dogs before, and the dogs died quickly after eating it."



"Is that so? That's a pity." Roland sighed. In this era, food sources were extremely scarce. If demonic beast meat were edible, winter would be a month of plenty. Just imagine, all the animals in the forest running madly towards Border Town, even saving the trouble of hunting.



After inspecting the city walls, he decided to visit Nana.



Now, the noble residence closest to the city wall had been requisitioned by Roland as a field hospital, or rather, it was publicly declared as a medical center. To be on the safe side, this place had become the most heavily guarded location in town, second only to the walls.



The homeowner here took away all the valuables that could be taken when returning to Longsong Stronghold, plus Border Town itself was a place that could be abandoned at any time, so although this residence was large, there was not a single decoration such as wall paintings, carpets, or porcelain. If it weren’t for the fact that it was fairly clean, it would look like a long-abandoned ownerless property.



Roland knocked down all the wooden partitions on the first floor, except for the corridors and the entrance hall, turning all the other rooms into one whole. Then he set up ten beds, and a simple hospital was formed. There were no nurses, no doctors, and it was even unlikely that all ten beds would be used—Nana's treatment did not require bed rest for recovery, but was effective immediately.



During the day, she would be on standby on the second floor of this hospital, and Anna would also come to accompany her when she was free. Titus Pine and Brian were responsible for guarding the first floor, and two personal guards were arranged to watch outside the door, making it foolproof.



However, what Roland did not expect was that the first patient to be received by the field hospital was not from the militia defending the walls, but a worker from the northern slope mine.

...

Nail felt his hands trembling.



Hearing the increasingly hoarse screams of Iron Head behind him, he quickened his pace again, even wishing he could fly.



It was all because of his own negligence, he thought, damn it, how could he have forgotten the knight’s admonition.



If he had known, he would never have taken on the job of operating the big guy!



Ever since this pitch-black behemoth was installed at the entrance of the mine, the miners' work has become much easier.

The most exhausting task used to be hauling the mined ore out of the mine. When the mining basket was filled with stones, it required three to four people to drag it. Typically, two pushed from behind while the rest pulled from the front. The uneven ground of the tunnels, worn smooth by years of mining and the constant dragging of baskets, required frequent replacement of the iron skids on the bottom of the baskets.



One week ago, the Chief Knight commanded Ironhead and his men to transport a pile of peculiarly shaped metal parts up the mountain, and after several days of effort, they assembled them into a furnace. Nails could never have imagined that once this furnace was lit, it would start moving on its own—not only that, but it also possessed incredible strength.



The knight said that this was an invention of His Royal Highness the Prince, apparently called a steam engine.



As long as the hemp rope is securely tied to the mining basket and the furnace is lit, this behemoth will start wailing and turn the winch, rapidly hauling the mining basket out of the mine.



It was simply unbelievable!



After the knight had demonstrated it a few times, he asked Ironhead to select someone to take charge of operating the steam engine. Nails was overjoyed when he was chosen. Just think, as long as he stayed by this machine, he would never have to go down into the mine to dig or push baskets again. He had been quite frightened by the last accident and the subsequent collapse.



So he committed to memory all the instructions given by the knight.



As it turned out, it wasn't difficult: when the behemoth needed to work, you simply had to lift the green-painted lever and then press down on the red lever. The knight explained that the green lever was connected to the intake valve, and the red lever to the exhaust valve, which allowed steam to flow through the pipes into the cylinder. After the mining basket was hauled up, to stop the machine you did the opposite: lift the red lever and press down on the green lever, and steam would be released through this pipe on the side of the boiler. After each cycle, the water in the furnace had to be topped up—although Nails did not understand what valves or cylinders meant, he agreed to all of it.



However, the knight emphasized two points that must be attended to. The first is that the sequence cannot be wrong; when starting the machine, the green lever must be pulled before the red, and when shutting it down, the red must be pulled before the green. A mistake could result in the machine's destruction. The second is that when venting, one must first clear away the miners in the vicinity and continue to shout warnings until the red lever is fully raised.



Nails had the first point down pat—he could do it with his eyes closed and wouldn't mess it up. But the trouble was with the second point.



Today, as usual, when shutting down the machine, there was no one else around. He felt that shouting warnings alone looked a bit foolish, so he went ahead and pulled the red lever without saying anything. The lever was a bit stuck, and it took him quite a bit of effort to finally pull it.



Unexpectedly, at the moment he pulled it, Ironhead appeared in front of the furnace—Nails swore he hadn't seen where the mine boss had come from, and the machine's loud roar had covered the sound of his footsteps. White steam screeched out from the exhaust, shooting straight into Ironhead's face!



Nails was shocked on the spot, as he saw Ironhead immediately fall backward to the ground, rolling around with his face covered, emitting a piercing scream—the sound sent shivers down his spine.



Soon other miners gathered around, holding down the writhing Ironhead, forcing his hands away. They saw that his face was a blurry mess, with blood oozing from the cooked rotten flesh, his eyes turned into white beads. Everyone present realized that Ironhead was beyond saving.



Nails, coming back to his senses, teared up. Ironhead had always taken good care of him, seeing that he was young, always assigning him less work than the others, but never shorting him on his wages. And now, it was his negligence that had led to this accident.



Amidst the grief and anxiety, Nails suddenly remembered what the knight had said—if someone in the mining area was accidentally injured, they could be taken near the city walls, where a new hospital had been established.



Even though he knew in his heart that such severe injuries were incurable, the wound area was too large, and herbs would be of no use, only continuing to rot away, followed by a high fever throughout the body, soon leading to unconsciousness. But still, he carried Ironhead on his back, disregarding the astonishment of those around him, clenched his teeth, and ran towards the foot of the mountain.



If he did nothing and simply watched on as Ironhead died, he feared he would never be able to forgive himself for the rest of his life.
