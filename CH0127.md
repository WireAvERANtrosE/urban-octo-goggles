## Wendy
After Roland had fallen asleep, Nightingale emerged from the Mist, quietly tidied up his blanket, covering the arm that was exposed outside, then stood by the bed and silently watched him for a moment before she soundlessly passed through the floorboards and returned to her own room.



"You haven't slept yet?" Nightingale was slightly surprised to see Wendy still sitting on the bed, reading a book.



"I'm afraid you'll do something wrong!" Wendy glared at her. "His Highness is not a toddler, is it necessary to watch over him until he falls asleep?"



"His Highness has already sent people to spread the news of a witch organization in other towns. What if a witch who hears this news comes with ill intentions towards His Highness? It's just a precaution," Nightingale replied as she picked up a wet towel, casually wiped her face, and then began to remove her red sash, wrist guards, and fastening straps, finally slipping out of her white attire—a new creation by the prince. Despite the pure white hooded cloak being strikingly eye-catching, he thought it was quite suitable for an assassin.



Nightingale carefully hung up the clothes, smoothing out every wrinkle. Her well-proportioned figure was enveloped in a layer of light gauze, and not a single ounce of excess fat could be seen on her tight abdomen and thighs.



"There won't be any accidents," Wendy put down the book she was holding. "The castle is inhabited by the sisters, and there are guards patrolling outside. Besides, haven't you already stuffed the stone under his pillow? You never used to touch those things before."



"Alright, I'm also doing it to ensure his safety," she said, sitting down beside the bed and taking off her long boots, then stretching her long legs and flipping over next to Wendy.



"Did you even listen to what I said last time?" Wendy sighed. "Veronica, we are witches."



"I know, Wendy," Nightingale nodded. "We are 'witches'."



His Highness the Prince will marry a witch—this he said himself, and... he wasn't lying.



Of course, this piece of intelligence wouldn't be disclosed by Nightingale unless absolutely necessary. She silently apologized to Wendy in her heart and changed the subject: "Do you have any other impressions of the Church?"



"Why do you suddenly ask?" Wendy was taken aback.



"Prince Roland was visited by the Archbishop of the church during his stay at the Stronghold Castle, who expressed his willingness to support him in seizing the throne."



"How did he respond?" Her voice tensed up, "Or did he ask you to leave before the conversation?"



Nightingale shook her head with a smile and softly said, "He just instructed me to be cautious of staying out of range of the other party's God's Stone of Retaliation. Moreover, His Highness didn't wear the thing himself at the time. Wendy, His Highness did not accept the Church's invitation; he rejected them."



The latter breathed a sigh of relief, then seemed a bit melancholy, "It's a pity that our help for His Highness is really limited, unlike the Church whose influence covers the entire continent. If Prince Roland had agreed to their terms, he might have ascended the throne much sooner..."



"Who knows, His Highness said the Archbishop was full of nonsense and couldn't be trusted," Nightingale paused, "There's just one thing that I'm very curious about." She recounted the incident with the red and black pill, "In the Mist, the pill had the same color as the God's Punishment Stone, which is simply unbelievable. All the sisters have seen what happens to those who swallow a God's Punishment Stone; it's no different from committing suicide. The Archbishop claimed that the medicine was developed by the Holy City's God's Prayer Room. Did you ever hear about this institution while you were in the monastery?"



When the Mutual Aid Society left Silver City, Cara had led Nightingale, Scroll, and Stone along with traps to capture those villains who followed them for the bounty, and they retaliated against them—one way was to stuff the God's Punishment Stones they wore into their mouths, forcing them to swallow. The villains who swallowed the God's Punishment Stone would die quickly, their bodies shriveling up as if dehydrated, like sun-dried fish.



"I don't know." Wendy closed her eyes and spoke slowly, "Ever since I can remember, I've lived in the monastery of the old Holy City. It was surrounded by high walls on all sides, and apart from the sky, no other scenery could be seen. My whole life was confined to the inside of the monastery, and it was the nuns who taught us how to read and recognize pictures. I still remember the name of the head nun, Fairy Ann. One of the books she read to us was specifically about the old Holy City, which had churches, monasteries, libraries, memorial halls, and the Hero Wall, but I never heard of a place called the God's Prayer Room. I lived in the monastery for over ten years, until that accident happened..."



Nightingale had heard Wendy mention before that the monastery had once been attacked by witches, and many had died in that accident. And she herself had fortunately escaped in the ensuing chaos, "Although I don't know which witch had the courage to challenge the Church alone, she at least saved you."



"No, Veronica, the witch came from the Church." Wendy shook her head, "She was, like me, a member of the monastery."



"What... do you mean?"



"The girls living in the monastery can basically be divided into three categories: those like me who have been there since childhood, unaware of their origins; wandering or orphaned children who are adopted by churches from various places and sent here; and those who are sold to the Church by their parents. The administrators separate everyone according to age, placing them in different dormitories, and the curriculum is also different. The youngest learn to read, those aged ten to fourteen learn hymns, and those fourteen and above learn etiquette. So the head nun also called us the Reading Class, and the older ones the Hymn Choir and Etiquette Class. Once the women of the Etiquette Class come of age, they would be sent away from the monastery."



These were things she was hearing for the first time—Wendy had never gone into detail about her experiences in the monastery before.



"In the first few years, I often heard screams at night—coming from the direction of the Hymn Choir and Etiquette Class; I didn't really understand what was happening. It wasn't until I moved up to the Hymn Choir that I found out that at night, adults from the Church would come to the dormitory, drag a few girls from their beds, and not return them until the next day. Sometimes... not all would be returned."



Nightingale clenched her lips tightly; she of course understood what Wendy meant.



"This happened once or twice a month, and at the most frequent times, it was almost every other day. Later, I was chosen, and Fairy Ann dragged me out of the room, whispering in my ear to just bear with it. She pulled me to a room in the corner of the garden, half-hidden underground, bright with lights inside. A girl from the Etiquette Class was chained to the wall, and four to five people were..." her voice trembled slightly, "As they approached me, the girl suddenly broke free from her shackles, grabbed the neck of the person closest to her, and killed him as easily as wringing a chicken's neck."



"She... awakened?"

"I'm not sure," Wendy shook her head, "Those people had removed their clothes, but they were still wearing the God's Punishment Stones. She killed them one by one, and one of them was torn limb from limb while still alive. Before dying, he seemed to be saying... extraordinary one. The lord's screams alarmed the guards and Farian who were outside the house. When they burst through the iron doors, they were petrified by the sight before them, and the woman charged straight at them."



"Extraordinary one... does that refer to a witch?" Nightingale asked. "The guards couldn't stop her?"



"The gap was too vast. I later found out that those guards were the Judgement Army. One of them blew a whistle while another drew his sword to meet her, but by the time the first whistle sound ended, the Judgement Army blocking the way had already had their chests pierced through by her hand. The church's standard armor was like paper in front of her."
