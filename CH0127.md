## Wendy
After Roland fell asleep, Nightingale materialized from the mist, tiptoeing to tidy up his quilt, covering the arm that was exposed outside, then stood by the bed to watch him silently for a moment before she noiselessly crossed the floorboards and returned to her own room.
"You haven't slept yet?" Nightingale was slightly surprised to see Wendy still sitting on the bed reading a book.
"Afraid you'd do something wrong!" Wendy glared at her. "His Highness is not a child, is there a need to watch over him until he falls asleep?"
"His Highness has already sent people to spread the news to other towns about the presence of a witch organization here. What if a witch who hears the news comes with the intention of harming His Highness? I am just being cautious," Nightingale explained as she picked up a wet towel and casually wiped her face. She then proceeded to undo the red sash around her waist, the leather armor on her wrists, the cloak fastenings, and finally slipped out of her white clothing—the set was a new creation by the Prince, and although the pure white hooded coat stood out strikingly, he thought it quite suitable for an assassin.
Nightingale carefully hung up the clothes, smoothing out every wrinkle. Her well-proportioned figure was wrapped in a light gauze, with not an ounce of excess flesh visible on her tight abdomen and thighs.
"What kind of accident could there be," Wendy put down the book in her hands, "the castle is inhabited by our sisters, and there are guards patrolling outside. Besides, haven't you already placed the stone under his pillow? You never used to touch those things before."
"Alright, I'm also doing it to ensure his safety," Nightingale sat down by the bed, removed her long boots, brought her slender legs together and raised them up, flipping over next to Wendy.
"Did you even listen to what I said last time?" Wendy sighed, "Veronica, we are witches."
"I know, Wendy," Nightingale nodded, "we are 'witches'."

And His Highness the Prince would marry a witch—this he said himself, and... he did not lie.
Of course, Nightingale would not spread this information unless absolutely necessary. Apologizing silently to Wendy in her heart, she changed the subject: "Do you have any impressions of the Church?"
"Why ask this all of a sudden?" Wendy was taken aback.
"When His Highness Roland was at the fortress castle, the High Priest of the church came to visit him and expressed his willingness to support him in seizing the throne."
"How did he respond?" Her voice became tense, "Or did he ask you to leave before the conversation?"
Nightingale shook her head with a smile and said softly, "He just instructed me to be mindful to stay away from the range of the other party's God's Stone of Retaliation. And the Prince himself did not wear that thing temporarily. Wendy, His Highness did not accept the Church's invitation; he refused them."
The latter breathed a sigh of relief, then seemed a bit melancholic, "It's a pity that our help to His Highness is really limited, unlike the Church, whose influence covers the entire continent. If Roland His Highness had agreed to them, I'm afraid he would have been able to ascend to the throne very quickly..."
"Who knows, His Highness said the High Priest was full of nonsense, and could not be trusted," Nightingale paused, "There's just one thing that I'm very concerned about." She mentioned the matter of the red and black pill, "In the Mist, the pill had the same color as the God's Stone of Retaliation, which is simply incredible. The sisters have all seen what happens to those who swallow the God's Stone of Retaliation, it's no different from suicide. The High Priest claimed it was a medicinal drug developed by the Holy City's God's Punishment Army, have you ever heard of this organization when you were in the monastery?"
When the Witch Cooperation Association left Silver City, Cara had led Nightingale, Chase, and Stone to set traps to capture those villains who followed for the bounty, and they took their revenge on them—one way was to stuff the God's Stone of Retaliation they wore into their mouths, forcing them to swallow it. Villains who swallowed the God's Stone of Retaliation would die quickly, their bodies shriveling up as if dehydrated, like fish dried in the sun.

"I don't know," Wendy closed her eyes and spoke slowly, "Ever since I can remember, I have lived in the convent of the old Holy City. It was surrounded by high walls, and I could not see any scenery other than the sky. My daily activities were confined within the convent, and it was the nuns who taught us to read and recognize pictures. I still remember her name, Farilan. In the books she read to us, one was specifically about the old Holy City, which had churches, convents, libraries, memorial halls, and the Hero Wall, but I had never heard of a place called the God's Prayer Room. I lived in the convent for over ten years until that accident happened..."

Nightingale had heard from Wendy before that the convent had been attacked by witches, and many had died in that accident. And it was during the chaos that she was lucky enough to escape the convent, "Although I don't know which witch had the courage to challenge the Church alone, she at least saved you."

"No, Veronica, the witch came from the Church," Wendy shook her head, "She was, like me, a member of the convent."

"What do you mean?"

"The girls living in the convent could basically be divided into three categories. One was like me, who had been there since childhood and had no knowledge of their origins; another was street children or orphans, taken in by churches from around the area and sent here; and the last were those sold to the Church by their parents. The administrators separated us by age and placed us in different dormitories, and we learned different things. The youngest learned to read, ten to fourteen-year-olds learned hymns, and those above fourteen learned etiquette. So the head nun called us the literacy class, and the older ones were called the hymn choir and the etiquette class. Once the girls in the etiquette class came of age, they would be sent away from the convent."

This was the first time she had heard Wendy speak in detail about her experiences in the convent.

"In the first few years, I often heard the girls' screams at night—coming from the hymn choir and the etiquette class. I didn't quite understand what was happening. It was only after I was promoted to the hymn choir that I found out that the adults from the Church would come to the dormitory at night, dragging a few girls from their beds, only returning them in the morning. Sometimes... not all would necessarily come back."

Nightingale clenched her lips; she understood all too well what Wendy meant.

"This happened once or twice a month, and at its most frequent, almost every other day. Later, I was chosen. Farilan dragged me out of the room and whispered in my ear to just endure it. She pulled me to a room partially buried underground in the corner of the garden, brightly lit inside, where a girl from the etiquette class was shackled to the wall, with four to five men around..." Her voice trembled slightly, "As they started to approach me, the girl suddenly broke free from the shackles, grabbed the neck of the man closest to her, and killed him as if wringing a chicken's neck."

"She... awakened?" 
"I'm not sure," Wendy shook her head, "Although those people had taken off their clothes, they were still wearing the Divine Stones of Retribution. She killed them one by one, and one of them was torn limb from limb while still alive; before dying, it seemed like he was talking about... extraordinary beings. The Lord's screams alerted the guards and Farian, who were outside the house. When they burst through the iron door, they were petrified by the sight before them, and the woman charged straight at them." 
"Extraordinary beings... you mean witches?" Nightingale asked, "The guards couldn't stop her?" 
"The gap in strength was too great. I later found out that those guards were part of the Judgement Army. One of them blew a whistle, while another drew his sword to meet her. By the time the first whistle had sounded, the Judgement Army soldier in front had already had his chest pierced through by her hand. The church's standard armor was like paper in front of her."
