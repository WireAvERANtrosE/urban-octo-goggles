## The Gift of Vengeance (Part 1)
The sun slowly sank into the mountains, and nightfall descended upon the Western Region.

The envoy group found an open space not far from the road and set up tents.

A bonfire was quickly lit in the center of the tents, the warriors took off their armor, stretched their weary bodies, and sat around the fire, boiling water for porridge.

Ashes brought a basin of hot water into the tent, "Your Holiness, please wash your face."

"Thank you." Mira smiled and nodded, dipping the towel into the water. "We will be able to reach Border Town by tomorrow, it's been a tough journey."

"Compared to dealing with demonic beasts, this is nothing," she replied. "But your riding skills have impressed me; I thought that priests were not good at traveling long distances."

"Ha ha, I wasn't born a priest. In my merchant days, riding horses was a common occurrence." Mira wiped the dust and sweat from her face with the towel and handed the basin to the female warrior, "You wash up too. How about it, feeling any better now?"

"What?" Ashes was taken aback.

"The matter with the God's Punishment Army," the priest said with a smile and a shake of her head, "it's written all over your face, it must be because of what Abram had said."



"She took the basin without answering.



"We will encounter many difficulties and challenges. If we can't overcome them, it's not just the Church that will suffer—the entire world will be in peril. Sometimes, sacrifices are necessary to block those terrifying enemies," Mayne said. "It's a dilemma, but don't forget the Church's maxim."



'Choose the lesser of two evils,' Ashes whispered.



"That's right. To weigh whether the cost is worth it, you have to consider what the goal is. Most importantly, the God's Punishment Army's transformation ceremony is entirely voluntary. When Abram's brother decided to become part of the God's Punishment Army, he was prepared to devote himself to the Church. It's a noble ideal, and his name will be inscribed on the Monument of Glory, to be passed down with the honor of the Church."



"Thank you for your guidance," Ashes said with her hand over her chest. "I feel much better now."



The bishop is right, they all devoted themselves to follow the glory of God, regardless of the outcome, at least the God's Punishment Army followed their own beliefs. Thinking of this, she felt the stifling feeling in her chest dissipate quite a bit.



"I'm glad I could help," Mayne chuckled. "Let's go out for dinner, they should have prepared it by now. Honestly, I've been having porridge so often lately that I can hardly tell the taste anymore."



"Fortunately, today is the last day," Ashes also smiled. "Tomorrow, we should be able to enjoy the lord's personal hospitality and a sumptuous dinner."



After finishing the bland dinner, the Chief Justice selected the night watchmen for the evening. The Judgment Warriors who were not assigned tasks promptly crawled into their tents to sleep early. Ashes was no exception. She and the bishop returned to their tent, extinguished the oil lamp, and covered themselves with the blanket."



I don't know how long it had been, but while she was dozing off, a faint thud suddenly came to her ears—it sounded like something had fallen to the ground. Soon after, there was a second noise.

This time, she also heard the sound of armor hitting the ground, subtle, but definitely not an illusion.

Her eyes flew open.

She rolled over and quickly grabbed the greatsword beside her, slowly moving to the edge of the tent, ready to lift a corner to peek outside, when the roar of the Judge resounded from the other side, "Enemy attack! Warriors, to arms!" His shout broke the stillness of the night, and the camp instantly erupted into chaos.

Then there was a loud bang!

The Judge's voice abruptly stopped.

She hesitated no longer, rolling out of the tent to see the Judge's greatsword split in two, no... not just his sword, the Judge himself was cleaved apart, blood spraying into the air. In the light of the campfire, he knelt down powerlessly, his body splitting to either side, slowly collapsing at the feet of a woman.

This woman, wielding an unusual greatsword, was the attacker, her whole body enveloped in a black cloak, with a hood that concealed her face. Under the shadow of the hood, Eleesha only saw a pair of golden pupils shining brightly.

Two more members of the Judgement Army charged forward, but against that terrifying weapon, their resistance was futile. The enemy's single strike took away a warrior, and again, both the man and his sword were split in two. The loud noise came from the moment the weapons clashed, sparks and debris flying in all directions, followed by the sound of the blade grinding against flesh and bone. The nightmare-like noise almost made the female warrior's blood freeze.



"It's a witch!" someone exclaimed in shock.

The enemy was alone... The only possibility for someone who dared to attack the Judgement Army by themselves was a fallen one who had obtained the power of devils!

"Take the priest and go!" A steady voice suddenly reached Ashes' ears.

She turned her head and saw it was Abram.

"You actually want me to leave my companions behind and escape first?" Ashes' eyes widened.

"Otherwise, you will just die here meaninglessly, don't you understand?" He frowned and roared lowly, "The opponent is not afraid of God's Stones of Retribution. Only the extraordinary have such power. I will do my best to stop her, you take the priest and head in the direction of Longsong Stronghold! Remember to stick to the main road, and immediately call for help when you encounter a camped caravan!" After speaking, he took up his sword and charged at the enemy.

Extraordinary... She took a deep breath, legend had it that only the God's Punishment Army could contend with them, and upon encountering an extraordinary witch, one should immediately seek aid from the local church. Ashes knew that what he said was right, staying here would only lead to their pointless sacrifice.

Five teammates had already fallen on the field, and the remaining Judgement Warriors changed their strategy, using tents and the terrain to engage in a guerrilla fight, which could buy them a little more time. But she knew that in front of an extraordinary being whose power and speed far surpassed theirs, annihilation was only a matter of time.

Clenching her teeth, she rushed into the tent, pulled up Mira who had already put on her shoes and was waiting for news, and ran towards where the horses were tied.



"What happened?" The priest asked in a deep voice.

"The Extraordinary attacked the camp! I must take you away!" She mounted her horse, "Please hurry!"

However, traveling at night made it impossible to see the condition of the road clearly. If they galloped on the uneven path, it was very likely they would trip the horse's legs. If they trotted, they wouldn't get far before the enemy caught up.

Alesia decided to let the horses run along the main road while she and the priest hid in the woods beside the road. Without the light of the fire, it would not be easy to find them.

The sounds of clashing weapons gradually faded into the distance. Holding Myra's hand, Alesia relied on the dim moonlight to make out their surroundings, constantly moving further away from the main road. They might encounter wild beasts or venomous snakes, but it was still preferable to encountering witches.

Not until they stumbled their way near the Impassable Mountain Range did Alesia breathe a sigh of relief. It seemed the pursuers had not followed them. Aside from the annoying birdsong overhead, all was silent around them.

"What should we do next?" Myra asked.

Even in such a situation, she did not seem too flustered, and this calmness earned Alesia's admiration. "My lord, we can find a place sheltered from the wind here and spend the night, then return to the Longsong Stronghold at dawn to seek support."

"Shouldn't we go to Border Town for refuge? It will take at least a day and a night to get back from here."



"No need," Ashes shook her head, "The extraordinary coming here is too coincidental. I suspect that the lord has already colluded with the witches. It's too dangerous to go to the town now."

"You make sense—" She suddenly froze, her eyes staring straight behind the female knight.

A sense of dread sank in Ashes' heart. She turned around and saw a woman in a black robe slowly walking out from the dark shadows of the trees, her eyes shining like twinkling stars. An owl circled down and landed on her shoulder.
