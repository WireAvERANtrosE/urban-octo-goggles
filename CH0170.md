## The Gift of Vengeance (Part 1)
The sun slowly sank into the mountains, and night fell upon the Western Region.

The envoy group found an open space not far from the road and set up their tents.

A bonfire was quickly lit in the center of the tents, the warriors took off their armor, stretched their tired bodies, and sat around the fire, boiling water for porridge.

Ashes brought a basin of hot water into the tent, "Priest, please wash your face."

"Thank you," Agatha nodded with a smile, dipping the towel into the water. "We will reach Border Town tomorrow, it has been a tough journey."

"Compared to dealing with demonic beasts, this is nothing," she replied. "But your riding skills have impressed me; I thought priests were not good at traveling far."

"Ha, I wasn't born a priest, when I was a merchant before, riding horses for travel was quite common," Agatha wiped the dust and sweat from her face with the towel and handed the basin to the female warrior, "You wash up too. How about it, do you feel better now?"

"What?" Ashes was taken aback.

"The matter with the God's Punishment Army," the priest said with a smile and a shake of her head, "Your feelings are all written on your face, it's because of what Abram said, isn't it?"



"...," she took the basin without answering.



"We, ah, will encounter many difficulties and challenges. If we cannot overcome these hurdles, not only the Church, but the whole world will be in danger. To hold back those terrible enemies, sacrifices are sometimes necessary," Mayne said. "This is a dilemma, but don't forget the church's maxim."



"Choose the lesser of two evils," Ashes whispered.



"That's right, whether the cost is worth it depends on what the goal is. Most importantly, the conversion ceremony of the God's Punishment Army is completely voluntary. When Abram's brother decided to become part of the God's Punishment Army, he was ready to dedicate himself to the church. It is a noble ideal, and his name will be inscribed on the Monument of Glory, to be passed down with the glory of the church."



"Thank you for your guidance," Ashes said with her right hand over her chest, "I feel much better now."



The bishop is right; they all dedicated themselves to following the glory of God. Regardless of the outcome, at least the God's Punishment Army followed their beliefs. Thinking of this, she felt the heaviness in her chest dissipate.



"It's good that I could help you," Mayne said with a light laugh, "Let's go out for dinner; they should have it ready by now. Honestly, I've been drinking porridge so often lately that I can hardly tell the taste anymore."



"Luckily, today is the last day," Ashes also said with a laugh, "Tomorrow we should be able to enjoy the personal hospitality and a grand dinner from the lord."



After finishing the bland dinner, the Chief Inquisitor selected the night watchmen for the evening. The Inquisitors not assigned to tasks quickly retired to their tents and went to bed early. Ashes was no exception. She and the bishop returned to their tent, extinguished the oil lamp, and covered themselves with blankets.



She didn't know how much time had passed, but as she was dozing off, a faint thud suddenly reached her ears—it sounded like something had fallen to the ground. Soon after, there was a second noise.

This time, she also heard the sound of armor hitting the ground, subtle but unmistakable.

Her eyes snapped open.

Rolling out of bed, Ashes quickly grabbed the greatsword beside her and crept to the edge of the tent, preparing to peek out, when from the other side came the furious roar of the High Judge, "Enemy attack! Warriors, to arms!" His shout shattered the quiet of the night, and the camp erupted into chaos.

Then came a tremendous crash!

The voice of the High Judge was abruptly cut off.

Without hesitation, she rolled out of the tent and saw that the High Judge's greatsword had been split in two—no...not just his sword, but the High Judge himself had been cleaved apart, his blood spurting skyward. Under the illumination of the campfire, he fell to his knees powerlessly, his body splitting apart and collapsing at the feet of a woman.

This woman, who wielded a strange and massive sword, was the attacker. She was shrouded in a black cloak, with a hood that concealed her face. Beneath the shadow of the hood, Ashes could only see a pair of gleaming golden pupils.

Two more of the Judgement Army charged at her, but their resistance was futile against the terrifying weapon. With each swing, the enemy's blade claimed a warrior, slicing through both man and sword alike. The loud crashes came from the clashing of weapons, sparks and debris flying everywhere, followed by the sound of blades grinding against flesh and bone. The nightmarish sounds almost froze the warrior woman's blood in her veins.



"It's a witch!" someone exclaimed in alarm.

The enemy was alone... The only one who dared to launch an attack on the Judgment Army by herself had to be a fallen one who had obtained the power of the devil—there was no other possibility!

"Take the priest away!" A calm voice suddenly reached Erya's ears.

She turned her head and saw that it was Abrams.

"You actually want me to leave my companions behind and escape first?" Erya's eyes widened.

"Otherwise, you will just die here meaninglessly, don't you understand?" He frowned and roared, "The other party is not afraid of the Divine Stone of Judgement, only the extraordinary possess such ability. I will try my best to stop her, you take the priest and head towards the Longsong Fortress! Remember to stick to the main road, and call for help immediately upon encountering a camping merchant caravan!" After speaking, he drew his sword and charged towards the enemy.

Extraordinary, she took a deep breath. It was said that only the God's Punishment Army could contend with them, and upon encountering an extraordinary witch, one should immediately seek help from the local church. Erya knew that he was right, staying here would only lead to their senseless sacrifice.

Five of her teammates had already fallen on the field, and the remaining Judgment Warriors changed their strategy, using tents and terrain to engage in guerrilla warfare, which could buy them a little more time. But she knew that in the face of an extraordinary being, whose strength and speed far exceeded theirs, annihilation was only a matter of time.

She clenched her teeth, rushed into the tent, grabbed Myra—who had already put on her shoes and was waiting for news—and ran towards the place where the horses were tied.



"What happened?" the priest asked in a deep voice.

"An Extraordinary attacked the camp! I must take you away!" She mounted her horse, "Please hurry!"

However, traveling at night made it impossible to see the condition of the road clearly. If one were to gallop on the uneven path, it was easy to trip and break the horse's legs. If they jogged, they wouldn't get far before the enemy caught up.

Alesia decided to let the horses run down the road while she and the priest snuck into the woods beside the road. Without the light of a fire, it would not be easy to find them.

The sounds of clashing weapons gradually faded away. Alesia took Myra's hand, using the dim moonlight to discern their surroundings as they moved deeper into the woods away from the main road. They might encounter wild beasts or venomous snakes, but it was still better than encountering witches.

It was only when they stumbled to a location near the Impassable Mountain Range that Alesia slightly relaxed. It seemed that the pursuer had not followed them. Apart from the annoying chirping of birds overhead, everything was silent around them.

"What should we do next?" Myra asked.

Even in such a situation, she did not seem too flustered, which made Alesia admire her composure, "My lord, we can find a sheltered spot here to spend the night and wait until dawn to return to Longsong Fortress for assistance."

"Aren't we going to take refuge in Border Town? It will take at least a day and a night to get back from here."



"No need," Ashes shook her head, "the Transcendent's arrival is too coincidental, I suspect that the lord has already colluded with the witches. Going to the town now is too dangerous."

"You may have a point—" She suddenly froze, her eyes staring straight behind the female warrior.

Ashes felt a sudden sinking feeling in her heart, she turned around, and saw a woman in a black robe slowly emerging from the dark shadows of the trees, her eyes shining like stars. An owl circled down and landed on her shoulder.
