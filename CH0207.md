## The Prime Body and the Copy.
Nightingale watched the changes in the witches' magic power through the Mist.

In the black and white world, it was rare to see such a splendid array of colors. Compared to the memories of searching for the Holy Mountain, the magic power within them had grown significantly, and daily practice had also refined their control over their abilities. However, what struck Nightingale the most was the expressions on their faces.

During the time with the Witch Cooperation Association, despite Wendy's gentle encouragement and Cara's resolute actions, the sisters had never truly slept in peace while living a life of hiding. Any slight disturbance would awaken them from their dreams, with the church's pursuit and the scrutinizing gaze of the public suffocating them. Even deep within the Impassable Mountain Range, this sense of oppression was hardly relieved. None of them knew whether they could truly reach the Holy Mountain and find a safe haven. During that time, the atmosphere in the camp would often become very gloomy, with most of the sisters wearing expressions of confusion and numbness.

Now, they no longer had to endure hunger or worry about the church's hunt, and everyone's face radiated an unprecedented brilliance. Seeing the relaxed and natural smiles of the crowd, Nightingale felt a shared joy in her heart. The Holy Mountain did exist after all, not in the wild lands but within this remote small town.

At that moment, she felt a ripple of magic power.

A purple mist began to swirl, constantly drawing magic power into it like a miniature storm. But only Nightingale could see this disturbance. She snapped back from her shock, widened her eyes, held her breath, and didn't want to miss any details—unlike Anna and Soraya who were oblivious, this was her first time witnessing the condensation of magic power with her own eyes.

At the center of the storm was Lily.

She was completely immersed in the microscopic world under the microscope, oblivious to the qualitative change in the magic power within her.

The mist became denser, and as the rotation speed increased, it became almost solid, while its outline began to fluctuate, no longer maintaining the initial vortex shape. Eventually, the magic power condensed inward into a mass and gradually came to a stop.



Her new magical power was neither as hard and smooth as Anna's cube nor as soft as Soraya's satin. It was only the size of a fist, spherical in shape, with eight pairs of wriggling tentacles, four pointing downward and four upward, looking like a... bug at first glance.

...

Roland did not expect that the first lesson on natural creatures would yield results, and that the first witch to evolve would be Lily.

Since her previous ability was to keep food fresh, Roland did not assign her any other tasks besides daily practice, and he did not know much about her. After listening to Nightingale's report, he nodded subtly without showing any emotion. He waited until the lesson was over before asking Lily to stay behind alone.

"What, you're saying my ability has evolved?" Lily was also surprised, "I didn't see the little ball you mentioned."

"Of course you wouldn't see it," Roland said with a smile, shaking his head, "The ball is thousands of times smaller than a microorganism, and even if you push the optical microscope to its limit, you still can't see the balls that make up matter."

"Is that so? I thought I had to understand the theory of little balls to evolve my ability," she muttered, "I don't believe that everything in the world is made up of little balls. Something as solid as rocks and steel, if it were really just a big pile of little balls stacked up, it would just collapse into a heap of loose sand."

So that's how it is, he thought, it seems that the microscopic particle theory is not the only way to promote the evolution of abilities, "So what did you see?"

"Um..." Lily thought for a while, "Several purple bugs, I think they must be summoned by magic, it can turn all those creatures you mentioned into the same form."



"Bugs?" he was slightly startled, "As small as microorganisms?"

"About that size," she nodded, "Anyway, if you look at that drop of water again with your eyes, it still appears clear and colorless."

"Then... let's do a practical test."

...

Since Lily's abilities were not as directly observable as Anna's or Soraya's, the test proved to be much more difficult.

Roland was also startled the first time he saw microorganisms arranged so neatly under a microscope; they acted as if they had a collective consciousness, exhibiting astonishing levels of cooperation and uniformity.

What followed were separate experiments, including its function, activation time, and the effects of magic stones on it.

The testing went on for three days, and although the young girl often liked to argue, she carried out Roland's orders meticulously despite her complaints.

Through extensive sample comparisons and discussions with Anna, he roughly figured out how Lily's new abilities worked.



Among these purple mutated swarm creatures, there were obviously two main categories: the primary bodies and the replicants.

The first microorganisms to mutate when Lily released her magic were the primary bodies.

The characteristics of the primary bodies were similar to Blackfire; as long as there was a supply of magic power, they could exist indefinitely. They could not be more than five meters away from their creator, otherwise, they would disappear on their own. Also, as summoned creatures, they were affected by the Divine Stone of Judgement. Within the range of the stone's influence, the primary bodies would be instantly dispersed.

However, when a primary body was present, the microorganisms around it would be assimilated into replicants in a short amount of time. What Roland found incredible was that the replicants belonged to the 'result' of an ability, similar to Soria's coating, and were no longer restrained by the Divine Stone of Judgement. Simply put, the magic primary creature created by Lily transformed the microorganisms into a new form of life, which truly existed.

The replicated microorganisms possessed the assimilation characteristics of the primary bodies and would actively erode other microorganisms. However, the test results puzzled Roland—the assimilation process seemed not to go on endlessly. In some samples, where an equal amount of replicant solution was dropped in, some microorganisms were completely transformed, while others showed coexistence of replicants and unmutated microorganisms.

Due to the lack of more precise observational instruments, this part could only be left to speculation.

After discussing with Anna, Roland arrived at a preliminary hypothesis—the number of assimilations a replicant could perform was related to its own size.

Lily's ability clearly did not distinguish between types of microorganisms. Thus, among the large number of replicants produced by the primary bodies, there were viruses and bacteria that could not be observed, as well as protozoa and single-celled algae that could be seen under a microscope. The size of these replicants' original bodies determined their assimilation capabilities—the larger the original body, the more assimilations it could perform after becoming a replicant.

Additionally, replicants could not extend their life by splitting and reproducing; once their assimilation count was exhausted, the last batch of replicants could only survive for about a day. Boiling the water could also kill most replicants—as emerging lifeforms, they did not differ much from other microorganisms.



However, an interesting point is that when a progenitor is present, these clones will gather around the progenitor like a swarm, arranging themselves in neat columns, like soldiers waiting for orders. 

Limited by the means of observation, there are still many unknown aspects of Lily's new ability, such as whether the progenitor and clones can have a variety of effects on life like bacteria and viruses, or replace various fungi for use in chemical and food production? Unfortunately, the young girl currently has no understanding of these concepts, let alone directing them to carry out corresponding instructions.

Even so, the clones have already shown great potential for development in the medical field. Even without doing anything, just by assimilating all the lethal bacteria or viruses, they can act as a rapid anti-inflammatory and antibacterial agent—this kind of unreasonable medicine clearly paves the way for the development of medicine in the territory.
