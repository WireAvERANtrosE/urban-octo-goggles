## Original Body and Duplicate
Nightingale observed the changes in the witches' magic power within the Mist.

In the black and white world, there were few opportunities to see such a multitude of dazzling colors. Compared to the memories of searching for the Holy Mountain, the magic power within them had grown substantially, and their daily practice had also refined their control over their abilities. However, what moved Nightingale the most was the expressions on their faces.

During their time with the Witch Cooperation Association, even with Wendy's gentle encouragement and Cara's resolute actions, they had never truly slept soundly while hiding and on the run. Any slight disturbance would startle the sisters awake from their dreams. The pursuit of the Church and the suspicious gazes of the masses were suffocating, and even deep within the Impassable Mountain Range, this sense of oppression was hardly alleviated. No one was sure whether they could truly reach the Holy Mountain and find a place to settle. Back then, the atmosphere in the camp was often gloomy, and the faces of most sisters were filled with confusion and numbness.

Now, they no longer had to endure hunger or worry about the Church's hunt. Everyone's face was radiant with an unprecedented vitality. Seeing the relaxed and natural smiles of the people, Nightingale's heart empathized with them. The Holy Mountain did exist after all, not in the barbaric lands but in this remote border town.

It was at this moment that she felt a ripple of magic power.

A mass of purple mist began to swirl, pulling in magic power from around it like a miniature storm. But this disturbance was only visible to Nightingale. She snapped out of her shock, widened her eyes, held her breath, and didn't want to miss any details—this was her witnessing the condensation of magic power firsthand, as opposed to Anna and Soraya's belated realization.

The center of the storm was Lily.

She was completely immersed in the microscopic world under the microscope, oblivious to the qualitative change in the magic power within her.

The mist grew denser, and as the rotation speed increased, it became almost solid while its outline began to fluctuate, no longer maintaining its initial vortex shape. Finally, the magic power condensed inward into a mass and gradually came to a stop.



Her new magical power was neither as hard and smooth as Anna's cube, nor as soft as Soraya's satin. It was only the size of a fist, spherical in shape, with eight pairs of writhing tentacles growing around it, four pairs pointing downward and four upward, looking at first glance like a... bug.

...

Roland had not expected that the first lesson on natural creatures would yield results, and that the first witch to evolve would be Lily.

Since her previous ability was to preserve food, Roland had not given her any other tasks besides daily practice, and he did not know much about her. After listening to Nightingale's report, he nodded subtly. Only after the lesson was over did he ask Lily to stay behind alone.

"What, you say my ability has evolved?" Lily was also surprised, "I haven't seen the small sphere you're talking about."

"Of course you wouldn't," Roland said with a smile, shaking his head, "the sphere is thousands of times smaller than a microorganism, and even if an optical microscope was pushed to its limit, it wouldn't be able to see the tiny spheres that make up matter."

"Is that so? I thought that understanding the sphere theory was necessary for the evolution of abilities," she muttered, "I can't believe that everything in the world is made up of tiny spheres. Things like rocks and steel, so solid, if they were really just a pile of tiny spheres stacked together, they would collapse into a heap of loose sand."

So that's how it is, he thought, it seems that the particle theory is not the only way to promote the evolution of abilities, "So what did you see?"

"Umm..." Lily thought for a moment, "Several purple bugs, I think they must be summoned by magic, they can turn all those creatures you talked about into the same shape."



"Bugs?" He paused slightly, "Are they the same size as microorganisms?"

"About that," she nodded, "Anyway, if you look at that drop of water with your eyes afterward, it still appears transparent and colorless."

"Well then... let's do an actual test."

...

Because Lily's abilities were not as directly observable with the naked eye as Anna's and Soraya's, the testing was much more difficult.

Roland was also startled the first time he saw the microorganisms arranged so neatly under the microscope; they behaved as if they had a collective consciousness, showing an astonishing level of coordination and uniformity.

What followed were separate experiments, including its function, activation time, and the effects of the Magic Stone on it.

The testing lasted three days, and although the young girl usually loved to argue, complaints aside, she still carried out Roland's instructions meticulously.

Through a large number of sample comparisons and discussions with Anna, he roughly figured out how Lily's new ability worked.



Among these purple mutated swarm insects, they were clearly divided into two major categories: the queen and the replicants.



The first microorganisms that mutated when Lily released her magic were the queens. The queen's characteristics are similar to the Blackfire, as long as there is magic supply, they can continue to exist indefinitely. They must not be more than five meters away from the creator, otherwise, they will disappear on their own. At the same time, as a summoned creature, they are affected by the God's Punishment Stones; within the range of the stones, the queen will be instantly dispersed.



However, when the queen exists, the microorganisms around it will be assimilated into replicants in a short time. What Roland found incredible was that the replicants belonged to the 'result' caused by the ability, just like Soraya's coating, they were no longer bound by the God's Punishment Stones. Simply put, the magic queen insects created by Lily transformed the microorganisms into a new form of life, and this form of life truly exists.



The replicated microorganisms possess the queen's assimilation characteristics and will actively erode other microorganisms. However, the test results left Roland feeling very puzzled—the assimilation process did not seem to go on endlessly. In some samples, the same amount of replicant solution was dropped in, some microorganisms were completely transformed, while in others, there was a coexistence of replicants and unmutated microorganisms.



Due to the lack of more precise observational instruments, this part could only be guessed.



After discussing with Anna, Roland came to a preliminary assumption—the number of assimilations a replicant can undergo is related to its own size.



Lily's ability clearly does not distinguish between types of microorganisms, so among the large number of replicants created by the queen, there are viruses and bacteria that cannot be observed, as well as protozoa and unicellular algae that can be seen under a microscope. The size of these replicants' original bodies determines their assimilation ability; the larger the original body, the more times it can assimilate after being transformed into a replicant.



In addition, the replicants cannot continue their life through the form of cell division and reproduction. When the number of assimilations is exhausted, the last batch of replicants can only survive for about a day. Boiling water can also kill most of the replicants—as emerging life forms, they are not much different from other microorganisms.



However, an interesting point is that when there is a progenitor present, these replicants will gather around the progenitor like a swarm of insects, arranging themselves into neat rows, as if waiting for orders like soldiers.



Limited by observational methods, there are still many unclear aspects of Lily's new ability, such as whether the progenitor and replicants can have a variety of effects on life like bacteria and viruses, or replace various fungi for use in chemical and food production. Regrettably, the young girl currently has no understanding of these concepts, let alone directing them to carry out corresponding orders.



Even so, replicants have already shown great potential for development in the medical field. Even without doing anything, as long as they assimilate all the deadly bacteria or viruses, they can have a rapid anti-inflammatory and sterilizing effect—this kind of unreasonable drug clearly paves the way for the medical development of the territory.
