## Military March
Echo sat at the very top of the castle—the slanted rooftop of the watchtower—where she could overlook the entire town. She had been brought up here by Lightning, who would come back to take her down after the sun set. By now, Lightning was probably on her way to Longsong Stronghold.



The weather today was fine, with sunshine making the land gleam brightly. The distant river looked like a glowing satin ribbon, slowly flowing westward, splitting the land adorned with green leaves and white snow into two. Lying in the sun, she felt enveloped in a gentle warmth, not like the scorching sun of the far south that easily stung the skin.



The wind was also different, she thought. In the Kingdom of the continent, the winds were varied: there was the slightly salty sea breeze of Clearwater Harbor, the fickle humid monsoons of the capital, the icy northern winds of the Impassable Mountain Range, and now the gentle breeze of the town carrying the scent of the earth. No matter what, the winds here were pure and single. In Ironsand City, there was either oppressive heat without a breeze, or an overwhelming storm. The wind was visible, roaring with pebbles and sand mixed in its gusts, like a black beast sweeping in. At such times, one must hide indoors or anywhere to avoid the wind. Standing against it meant certain death.



Echo let out a soft breath. Now that she thought about it, she had left Ironsand City nearly four years ago. The Osha clan had met with misfortune in their struggle for power, and her father had been killed by the enemy after his surrender. She had witnessed it all and wanted to rush forward to die with the enemy, but she was struck down from behind.



She wondered how many of her clan members had survived after four years.



Before she was sold as a slave to Clearwater Harbor, she had faintly heard that the Osha clan had broken the sacred duel agreement and were despised by the three gods. Those exiled would be banished to the Endless Cape, never to return to Ironsand City. But Echo knew it was all a conspiracy of the Iron Whip clan, who had smeared their whips with the black oil flowing beneath the ground. Once ignited, not even water could extinguish it. It was this tactic that had caused her brother, the strongest warrior of their clan, to be burned alive during the duel, leading to the chaos of their ranks.



Beyond the scorching yellow sand of the Endless Cape, there were only ever-burning pillars of fire and an ocean more tempestuous than Mother Earth. The Sand People going there would soon become skeletons, a fate even more miserable than her own as a slave.



After awakening as a Divine Lady—what the Kingdom of the continent called a witch—Echo had thought about revenge, but her ability to mimic sounds was useless. No matter how much she pleaded with the three gods, they did not bestow their will upon her. After living in Clearwater Harbor for half a year, she realized even more that the favored tales of Divine Ladies were nothing but a deception, a self-deluding scam by the Mojin people. Within the territories of the Four Kingdoms, Divine Ladies were targets hunted by the Church. From that day on, Echo completely abandoned any hope of revenge.



At that moment, billowing smoke suddenly rose in the distance. She looked towards the east bank of the Redwater River, only to see a flame flickering with a soft green light weaving through the grove. The black smoke from the burning trees mixed with the white mist evaporating from the snow, forming a gray column of smoke on the horizon.

That was Anna's green flame.

When she first arrived, Wendy had briefly introduced Anna and Nana to the sisters. At the time, Echo was very envious of Anna's ability. Flames that could be manipulated freely, heat intense enough to melt swords... If she had had such a powerful force back in Ironsand City, not a single person from the Whip Clan would have survived.

Echo shook her head; thinking about these things now was pointless. Compared to her clan members who were likely already buried under the sands, being alive was a stroke of luck. Since His Royal Highness was willing to take her in, the best she could do was to work hard and carry out the orders he entrusted to her.

She cleared her throat and began to hum the song as requested.

It was a cheerful tune; His Royal Highness had only hummed it once, and she had completely memorized the entire melody.

Music was not unfamiliar to Echo. As a top-grade slave, she was taught enticing dances and seductive, soft singing—all skills she needed to master. But the song from His Highness was completely different... It was full of rhythm, bursting with an uplifting vitality, especially when he asked her to imitate the sound of a flute to play the piece, each note seemed to come alive, making one unable to resist dancing along.

The challenge was to combine drumbeats and string music while the tune was in progress. Simulating three different sounds at the same time and overlapping them was a first for Echo. She had never thought that music could be played in such a way!

At first, she struggled to keep the drumbeats from disturbing the rhythm of the flute. It was only by trying the method suggested by His Highness, tapping the beat with her hands or feet, that she gradually blended the two sounds together.



After several days of practice, Echo gradually mastered this way of imitation.

After practicing singing a few times, she stood up, deciding to add the final string music as well.

As the music played, Echo found that the tune had changed again—if the cheerful flute formed its trunk, and the vigorous drumbeat gave it its bones, then the final string music, which seemed like a mere embellishment, endowed the tune with a soul. She stepped in time with the beat, over and over, blending the three types of instruments into one. The sound grew louder and louder until she couldn't help but burst into song—

...

"My attack power is higher than yours, so I win."

Roland placed the last card on the table, while the person across from him, Soraya, covered her face, letting out a low sound of sudden realization.

"Let's play another round," she pondered for a moment and then gathered up the cards again, "this time let me choose your ten cards."

"Ahem," the prince coughed, "It's getting late, I have things to do, you go find someone else to play with."

After making a roughly adequate deck, the next step was copying. With a template in front of her, Soraya's drawing speed was comparable to a printer. Soon, Roland received several identical sets of Gwent cards.



So Soria became his first opponent.

After explaining the rules of the game, a card battle ensued. During the match, he discovered that the witches indeed had a higher capacity for learning than ordinary people. Soria quickly grasped the tactics of playing cards, and in the following rounds, although Roland could still win, he had to resort to using special decks. Now, seeing that his opponent asked to draw cards for him, he shamefully refused.

"Alright," Soria scooped the cards into her chest and ran towards the door. Just at that moment, cheerful and pleasing music came from outside the window. She halted her steps, ran back, and leaned out of the window to look around, "Is that an echo?"

"Hmm, it looks like she has completely mastered it," Roland leaned back in his chair, enjoying the familiar music.

Border Town's First Army was soon to enter the comprehensive exercise phase. Unlike shooting from the city walls, the comprehensive exercise would take place in the field, requiring the troops to advance while maintaining order and discipline—this was also the fundamental element of firing squad executions. To keep the soldiers' steps uniform, they relied on drumbeats or cadences to direct everyone's marching pace. Now that they had a witch capable of mimicking mixed sounds, he simply decided to follow the British and directly adopt an infantry march.

Compared to simple drumbeats, a marching tune could not only control the speed of the troops but also effectively inspire and invigorate their spirits. Of course, the most famous marching tune during the firing squad era, "The Grenadiers' March," was only known to Roland by name; he could not recall the complete melody.

But this was no obstacle for him, as there was a tune that was adapted from "The Grenadiers' March" and became widely known throughout the country during the war of resistance. Its melody was familiar to almost everyone; it was the renowned "Song of the Guerrillas."

Soria turned her head; she heard the prince following the tune, humming softly. It was a language she had never heard before, crisp and clear, perfectly matching the rhythm of the song.

"We are all sharpshooters,"



"One bullet takes out one enemy;"

"We are all from the Aerial Knights,"

"Even if the mountains are tall and the waters are deep!"

"In the dense forests,"

"Everywhere are the camps of our comrades;"

"On the lofty hills,"

"There are countless good brothers of ours."

"......"
