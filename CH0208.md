## "I am such an idiot."
Lily wrapped her wet hair in a towel and returned to her room.



Although she had previously criticized the prince for his excessive pursuit of pleasure, she had to admit that the bathroom was truly... amazing. Enjoying the cool well water from the showerhead, washing away the sweltering heat and stickiness brought by the scorching sun, made her feel rejuvenated after a busy day.



However, after the refreshing shower, she felt a twinge of guilt. She couldn't help but wonder if she should apologize to His Highness for the harsh words she had spoken on impulse that day.



"Traitor!"



"What?" Lily brushed away the strands of hair sticking to her forehead.



"You clearly said you didn't believe in the Sphere Theory at all, and now you're the first to evolve a new ability," Miya knelt on the bed, sitting upright, and pointed at her, "You're a big liar!"



Lily rolled her eyes, "I still don't believe it now. Everything is made up of tiny spheres... How could that be possible?"



"But Nightingale said your magic has condensed."



"It has nothing to do with the spheres," she shrugged, climbed onto the bed, and pressed Miya's hand down, "His Highness said that evolution doesn't necessarily require acceptance of the Sphere Theory. As long as you can deeply understand your own abilities, your magic can still undergo a qualitative change."



"Really?" Miya pouted.

"That's what he said, anyway."

Miya wasn't valued in the Witch Cooperation Association, which led to her lack of confidence, Lily thought. Unlike herself, the ability to preserve food was very important to the Witch Cooperation Association, where food was scarce. She could also understand Miya's feelings because, after coming to Border Town, her own ability had become redundant and of no use. She too had feared being kicked out of the town, but the outcome was completely opposite to her worries. Although Prince Roland had not given her any additional tasks, his attitude towards her was no different from that of the other witches.



Perhaps this was also the reason Miya had become increasingly bold, shedding her previous restraint and insecurity. Most of her timidity was due to Cara never giving her a second glance, even forbidding her from using her abilities in the camp.



"So..." Miya frowned, "how can I understand my own ability? His Highness said that magnetic fields are invisible and intangible, and microscopes are useless too."



"Don't ask me, I don't understand either," Lily yawned, "In fact, I only know what my ability looks like. All that talk about cells, bacteria, fungi... I don't understand any of it. He also said he would write a textbook for me," she said helplessly, "spare me, I haven't even fully learned to read."



"I want to become stronger too," Miya rolled around on the bed, "I want to do more for His Highness!"



Lily sighed. Even though Miya was older than her, she acted even younger... "You should ask Sister Anna."



"Ask her?" The rolling stopped abruptly.



"Yeah, weren't you worried about delaying His Highness's time? Then you should ask Sister Anna for advice," Lily said. "Aside from His Highness Roland, she's the most knowledgeable person in the whole town."



"But Anna is also very busy, I heard that she made all the machines in town," Miya hesitated.



"That's why you can ask her during her free time, like after dinner, or ask for her help in heating bath water, or even better invite her to join you in a bath. Wouldn't that give you plenty of time to ask questions?" the little girl suggested with a scheme.



"What you're saying... seems to make sense," her eyes lit up.



"Then let's go to sleep, we have to wake up early tomorrow," Lily undid the towel from her head, wiped it off a couple more times, and then collapsed onto the pillow. "You go blow out the candle."



"Uh, alright." She crawled to the end of the bed, blew out the candlelight, "Good night."



...



The next day, Lily did not go to the kitchen or the wheat warehouse to practice her abilities as usual. Instead, she sat at the desk and began to learn how to use the microscope.



This was the new task assigned by His Highness—before the textbooks arrived, to fully understand the types and shapes of various cells and fungi, and to record their differences. Not being able to write was not an issue, drawing would suffice.



Moreover, His Highness mentioned that Anna is still working on producing a microscope with a higher magnification. If she can achieve a 400x magnification, she would be able to see even smaller microorganisms—bacteria. 

The content of future practice will naturally no longer be about preservation but trying to diversify the applications of the original and the duplicates. Lily found this somewhat hard to understand, but fortunately, His Highness proposed several directions for practice, such as commanding them to mimic the appearance of a single-celled organism or directing them with consciousness to destroy or improve cells. Of course, all these must be based on a thorough understanding of various tiny life forms. Although Lily didn't know if she could achieve this, she had to give it a try. 

Besides, exploring the unknown world is an interesting thing in itself. 

When evening came, Miya returned with a dejected look on her face. 

"What's wrong?" she asked curiously. "Did Sister Anna say anything?" 

"She said a lot," Miya collapsed onto the bed, "but I didn't understand a single word. She talked about the omnipresence of magnetic fields and how compasses can show direction because we are in the midst of a vast magnetic field. Does this mean my ability is utterly useless? Not to mention the principles of the magnetic field, something about moving charged particles and magnetic forces being interdependent, and that magnetic fields can generate electric currents... Surely, without understanding the theory of particles, there can be no progress, right?" she muttered in a low voice. "Tell me, am I just too dumb?" 

"A bit," Lily said, holding her forehead. 

"Traitor!" 

...



Another sister in the Witch Union had gained a new ability, which made Wendy very happy.

Moreover, Lily's evolution had greatly inspired the other witches' enthusiasm for learning. After tonight's lesson ended, there were still people incessantly asking questions with scrolls in hand. Even Maggie, upon hearing that studying could enhance her own abilities, had obediently perched atop the chandelier to listen to the lecture.

Only one person was the exception.

When Wendy returned to her room holding "The Basics of Natural Science Theory," she found Nightingale sprawled across the desk, intently sorting something.

Wendy knew it definitely had nothing to do with studying.

"What are you doing?" she asked.

"Sorting fish jerky. Want some?" Nightingale said unclearly, with a piece of fish jerky in her mouth, "Just got it from the kitchen."

"All this?" Wendy exclaimed in surprise, looking at the pile of golden-brown baked fish jerky on the table, as the rich scent of honey hit her nostrils.

"Mhm, the chef saw me coming every day and decided to just bake all the leftovers. Anyway, this stuff can last for a long time." She took out a small cloth bag and filled it with a handful of the snack. There were also five or six other similar cloth bags on the table, each one stuffed full.



Wendy instantly understood what she was doing—this was the preparation of rations. Whenever the Witch Cooperation Association was ready to leave town, they had to portion out the rations, pack them into cloth bags to carry along. No matter how hungry they were along the way, they could only eat the specified amount, to prevent running out of food. Since coming to Border Town, with the stable supply of three meals a day and the regular afternoon teas, the sisters had never had to do this again.



Of course, for Nightingale, it was less about preparing rations and more about preparing snacks.



"Aren't you reading?" Wendy asked.



"I can't understand it anyway. Just hearing those theories and theorems makes my head spin," Nightingale swallowed a piece of dried fish and laughed, "Besides, my ability is sufficient as it is, whether it evolves or not doesn't really matter."



I see.



Compared to before, Nightingale's eyes were now sparkling, there was no strain or hesitation, only a naturalness. Wendy thought, a confused person couldn't show such an expression—Nightingale had already found her goal.



Once she understood the path she wanted to take, her determined side would show, just like when she left her noble family, faced Cara, and now was no different.



But Wendy didn't ask, because she believed that one day she would see the answer for herself.
