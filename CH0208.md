## "I really am an idiot."
Lily wrapped her wet hair in a towel and returned to her room.

Although she had previously accused the prince of being too indulgent in pleasure, she had to admit that the bathroom was truly... amazing. Enjoying the cool well water from the showerhead that washed away the heat and stickiness brought on by the scorching sun, her body felt rejuvenated after a busy day.

However, after the refreshing shower, she felt a little guilty. She had spoken too hastily that day and now wondered if she should apologize to His Highness.

"Traitor!"

"What?" Lily brushed aside the hair sticking to her forehead.

"You clearly said you don't believe in the Sphere Theory at all, and now you're the first to evolve new abilities," Miya sat kneeling on the bed, sitting up straight, pointing at her, "You're a big liar!"

Lily rolled her eyes, "I still don't believe it. Everything is made up of tiny spheres... How is that possible."

"But Nightingale said your magic has condensed."

"It has nothing to do with spheres," she shrugged, climbed onto the bed, and pushed down Miya's hand, "His Highness said that evolution doesn't necessarily require accepting the Sphere Theory. As long as you can deeply understand your own abilities, it's still possible to induce a qualitative change in your magic."



"Really?" Miya pouted.

"That's what he said anyway."

Miya had been overlooked even when she was with the Witch Cooperation Association, which led to her lack of confidence, Lily thought. Unlike herself, the ability to preserve food was very important for the Association due to the shortage of food supplies. She could also understand the other's feelings because, after coming to Border Town, her own abilities had become useless, completely superfluous. She too had been afraid of being kicked out of the town, but the result was completely opposite to her worries. Although Prince Roland hadn't given her any additional tasks, his attitude towards her was no different from the other witches.

Perhaps this was also the reason Miya had become increasingly bold from her previous restraint and lack of self-esteem; most of her timidity was because Cara had never looked her in the eye, even forbidding her from using her abilities in the camp.

"Then..." Miya frowned, "how can I understand my own abilities? His Highness said that magnetic fields are invisible and intangible, and that microscopes are useless too."

"Don't ask me, I don't understand either," Lily yawned, "In fact, I only know what my abilities look like. All that stuff His Highness talks about, cells, bacteria, fungi... I don't understand any of it. He also said he would write a textbook for me," she said helplessly, "spare me, I haven't even learned all my letters yet."

"I also want to become stronger," Miya rolled around on the bed, "I want to do more for His Highness too!"

Lily sighed. Miya was actually older than her, but she acted even younger... "You should ask Sister Anna." 

"Ask her?" The rolling stopped abruptly.



"Yeah, aren't you worried about wasting His Highness's time? Then you should learn from Sister Anna," Lily said. "Besides His Highness Roland, she's the most knowledgeable person in the whole town."

"But Anna is also very busy. I heard that all the machines in the town were made by her," Miya hesitated.

"That's why you can ask her when she's free, like after dinner, or when you ask her to help heat up the bathwater, or better yet, invite her to join you in the bath. Wouldn't that give you plenty of time to ask questions?" the young girl suggested with a scheme.

"What you're saying... seems to make sense," her eyes lit up.

"Let's go to sleep, we have to get up early tomorrow," Lily untied the towel from her head, wiped twice more, and then collapsed onto the pillow. "You go blow out the candle."

"Uh, alright," she crawled to the end of the bed, blew out the candle, "Good night."

...

The next day, Lily didn't go to the kitchen or the wheat warehouse to practice her abilities as usual. Instead, she sat down at the desk and began to learn how to use the microscope.

This was a new task assigned by His Highness—before the textbooks arrived, to thoroughly familiarize herself with the types and shapes of various cells and fungi, and to record their differences. If she couldn't write, that was fine; drawing would suffice.



Moreover, His Highness mentioned that Anna is still trying to create a microscope with a higher magnification. If she can achieve a 400 times magnification, she'll be able to see even smaller microorganisms—bacteria.

Naturally, the focus of future practice will also shift from preservation to diversifying the applications of the original and the duplicates. Lily found this somewhat difficult to comprehend, but thankfully, His Highness proposed several directions for practice, such as commanding them to mimic the appearance of a single-celled organism, or using consciousness to direct them to destroy or modify cells. Of course, all of this must be based on a comprehensive understanding of various microorganisms. Although Lily was unsure whether she could achieve that, she had to try.

Besides, exploring the unknown world is an intriguing endeavor in itself.

When evening arrived, Miya came back looking dejected.

"What's the matter?" she asked curiously, "Did Sister Anna say anything?"

"She said a lot," Miya collapsed onto the bed, "but I couldn't understand a word. She talked about how magnetic fields are everywhere, and that compasses point directions because we're in the midst of a huge magnetic field. Does that mean my abilities are basically useless? Not to mention the principles of magnetic fields, something about moving charged particles depending on magnetism, and that magnetic fields can generate electrical currents... Without understanding the theory of particles, is it impossible to progress?" she muttered in a low voice, "Tell me, am I just too stupid?"

"A little," Lily said, holding her forehead.

"Traitor!"

...



Another sister in the Witch Union had gained new abilities, which made Wendy very happy.

Moreover, Lily's evolution had greatly motivated the other witches to learn. After the evening's class, some were still eagerly asking questions, holding onto their scrolls. Even Maggie, upon hearing that studying could enhance her own abilities, behaved herself and sat attentively on the chandelier to listen.

Only one person was the exception.

When she returned to her room with "The Basics of Natural Science" in hand, Nightingale was lying on the desk, focusing on organizing something.

Wendy knew it had nothing to do with studying.

"What are you doing?" she asked.

"Sorting fish jerky, want some?" Nightingale replied with a piece of fish jerky in her mouth, her words muffled, "Just got it from the kitchen."

"So much?" Wendy was surprised to see the pile of golden-brown roasted fish jerky on the table, the rich honey scent wafting to her nose.

"Yep, the chef saw me coming every day and decided to just roast all the leftovers. After all, this stuff can last a long time." She took out a small cloth bag and filled it with a handful of snacks. Beside the table, there were five or six other bags, each stuffed full.



Wendy immediately understood what she was doing—this was preparing rations. Whenever the Mutual Aid Society prepared to leave town, they had to divide the rations accordingly and pack them into cloth bags they carried with them. No matter how hungry they were on the road, they could only eat the allotted amount to prevent running out of food. Since coming to Border Town, with a stable supply of three meals a day and the frequent afternoon tea parties, the sisters had never needed to do this again.



Of course, for Nightingale, it was less about preparing rations and more about preparing snacks.



"Aren't you going to read?" Wendy asked.



"I can't understand it anyway. Just listening to all those theories and theorems gives me a headache," Nightingale swallowed the dried fish and laughed, "Besides, my abilities are sufficient as they are, it doesn't matter whether I evolve or not."



So that's how it is.



Compared to before, Nightingale's eyes were now sparkling, devoid of any reluctance or hesitation, filled with sheer naturalness. Someone who is lost could not show such an expression, Wendy thought. She had found her goal.



Once she understood the path she wanted to take, her resolute side would show itself. It was the same when she left her noble family, the same when she confronted Cara, and it was the same now.



But Wendy did not ask, because she believed that one day she would see the answer with her own eyes.
