## Answer
All the curtains had been drawn, and the flames in the fireplace burned vigorously, maintaining a comfortable temperature within the room.

Unlike Anna's coming-of-age day, Nana was awake. To ensure she could quickly gather her spirits before the pain arrived, everyone accompanied her, telling stories or playing some simple games to keep her from dozing off.

Roland even performed a few coin tricks, leaving the crowd dumbfounded, especially Nana, who stared intently at Roland's hands. If it were any other time, she would probably be clamoring to learn by now.

The magic of this era remained at the stage of grandiose acrobatics. What Roland had seen in the palace included snake charming with flutes, fire breathing, and breaking stone slabs on one's chest—far behind the sleight of hand and finger dexterity that would be more specialized in later eras of close-up magic.

Finally, Lightning shared her sailing experiences, navigating through islands and fjords with her father Thunder, braving whirlpools and hidden reefs, hunting deep-water giant sharks, and octopuses in grand adventures. Although they all knew that much of it was made up, everyone listened with great interest, even Roland, who was thoroughly engrossed—imagining those sailboats as ironclad warships racing across the boundless sea, reaching new continents.

In truth, he did not understand the historical process of this world very well, with clear chronological records stopping more than four hundred and fifty years ago. Recalling what the prince had learned from the court tutor, the reason was not mentioned, perhaps because the guy had never paid attention in class, he thought. Border Town also lacked facilities like archives or libraries. After taking down Longsong Stronghold, he planned to seek out some learned scholars for answers.

When Lightning finished her adventure story, Roland couldn't help but yawn. He looked towards Nightingale, who shook her head, indicating that the magic power had not changed yet. Without accurate timing tools, it was inconvenient to determine how long they had been waiting. Roland poured himself a cup of warm water and sat down to continue waiting.

But gradually, everyone sensed that something was amiss—the time was dragging on too long. Nana was yawning continuously, on the verge of succumbing to sleepiness, and Nightingale grew anxious. She touched the girl's forehead while watching the flow of magic power within her body.

Roland picked up his cup and discovered it was empty. He went to the fireplace to refill his cup from the kettle. Passing by the window, he couldn't resist lifting the curtain to peek outside and check if the snow had changed. As the heavy curtain fabric lifted slightly, a ray of light streamed in.



He was pleasantly surprised to find that a glimmer of dawn was already breaking through the pitch-black sky.

"Look!" Roland pulled back the entire curtain, and everyone was startled by his shout and turned around. Only then did they realize that a new day had dawned.

Nana had safely survived the day of magic backlash.

...

Roland stretched and returned to his bedroom, only to find two more people present.

Nightingale and Wendy.

Their faces showed not a trace of sleepiness; they were only filled with excitement.

"Are you really sure Nana's 'date' was today—no, last night?" Roland asked.

"Yes, the changes were very subtle at the time, and I thought we hadn't reached the critical moment of backlash," Nightingale affirmed. "Your Highness, you were right! As long as we keep releasing magic power, its total amount will continue to grow, but the pain the body endures will lessen. If we can maintain a certain amount of training every day, there's a great chance for all witches to survive past their adult day!"



"In the entire Kingdom of Greycastle, only your territory allows witches to use their abilities unrestrained. In a sense, this place is the Holy Mountain for the witches," Wendy continued, "I beg of you to let as many witches as possible know this news, so that our sisters can come to the sanctuary sooner. I think they would be willing to serve you."



"I was planning to do just that," Roland nodded, "When the Evil Months are over, the subjects will have a certain degree of understanding and contact with the witches. By then, I will arrange for people to spread the news—in the form of rumors. You should know that I can't openly recruit witches; doing so would cause an uproar within the country," he paused briefly, "unless the Church perishes, or I ascend the throne."



"Then I am willing to help you ascend the throne." Wendy seemed to have been waiting for those words, and without hesitation, she knelt on one knee and pledged her loyalty. It was clear that her actions were not practiced, seemingly improvised on the spot. But Roland did not dwell on these details; he accepted her loyalty just as he did with Nightingale.



After rising, Wendy smiled at Nightingale, "How did I do?"



The latter pursed her lips, "Barely passable."



Roland shook his head helplessly, "In that case, go get some sleep earlier, you've been up all night."



"Your Highness, I have another request." Wendy, who had just stood up, knelt down again.



"Go ahead." Roland put away his smile and asked seriously. It was clear from her posture that she was about to ask for something difficult to agree to.



"I want to go back to the camp once more."



"Wendy!" Nightingale exclaimed in surprise, her eyes filled with determination.



"I don't know if they have found the Holy Mountain, maybe they have, maybe not. I hope to go to the Impassable Mountain Range after the Evil Months are over. If Cara hasn't found the Holy Mountain, they should have returned to the mountains by now."



"That's the most dangerous situation," Roland frowned, "Your respected teacher attacked you without regard for your past relationship."



"If she truly wanted to kill me, I would have died then and there," Wendy said. "The demon snake she summoned was 'Pain,' not 'Execution.' I might not be able to bring many back, perhaps not even one, but at least I can deliver the message to our sisters. As long as they release their magic power every day, they won't have to suffer that terrible pain." Her voice softened as she spoke, "Your Highness, as long as you continue to treat witches well, my life belongs to you, and I certainly won't give up easily. I will take good care of myself. Please grant me this request."



Roland fell silent. For safety reasons, he should refuse Wendy's request. But he also understood what this meant to her—given the chance to save more witches, she was willing to take the risk. If he refused, she might follow his orders, but the loss of her sisters would leave a permanent scar in her heart.



"I promise you," Roland finally nodded, "But it has to be two months after the Evil Months have ended, and you must go with Lightning. I will provide you with firearms for self-protection, and... God's Punishment Stones. Lightning will provide support from a distance, and with the God's Punishment Stone, Cara or other witches won't be able to harm you with their abilities."



"Your Highness, please let me accompany her!" Nightingale said.



"No, Veronica. The safety of His Highness is much more important than mine; he is the hope of all witches," Wendy said with a shake of her head and a smile, "Take good care of him."
