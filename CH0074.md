## Shipbuilding Endeavor
"What, can't afford it?" Roland sat in his office, the document requesting the expansion of administrative staff and the purchase of sailboats laid out on his desk.



Barov cleared his throat, "Your Highness, indeed so. The price of a two-masted sailboat ranges between eighty to one hundred and twenty Gold Royals, but that is just the cost of building the boat. Including the crew, the total price is estimated to be over two hundred Gold Royals."



"Didn't I say that I don't need sailors, helmsmen? Not even a captain, I just want the boat," Roland tapped the table and asked. With Wendy around, he didn't need so many people to operate a sailboat. Most of the riverboats used square sails, which were as easy to operate as raising and lowering a flag. Oarsmen and sailors were superfluous, and any random person could be pulled up to try their hand at steering. After all, with the vector wind, what's there to fear about the boat not moving forward?



"Your Highness, there's no such trade, at least not in Willow Town," Barov explained carefully, "You may not be very familiar with this industry. Generally speaking, the owner of a ship is the captain. It could be a merchant or a noble. The former recruits hands themselves and travels back and forth between the docks of various towns, engaging in trade or transporting goods. The latter usually recruits a deputy captain to manage the ship on their behalf. Employees are not paid monthly, but once every one to three years."



"Most of the time, the ship and its crew are tied together. You plan to buy the boat from the captain without his hired hands, which would mean a loss for him in terms of the wages paid. Even for a great noble, eighty Gold Royals is not an amount that can be easily parted with. Including the gemstone raw material transaction with Willow Town at the beginning of the month, the city hall currently has a balance of three hundred and fifteen Gold Royals. If we spend more than half of that on a boat, next month we won't be able to pay the militia," the assistant minister finished in one breath, lifting his cup to drink some barley beer.



"You said 'most of the time'..."



"That's right," he nodded, "There are two situations where an empty ship might be for sale. One is when a merchant is in urgent need of cash and liquidates his assets. At that time, he will dismiss all his crew and then sell the boat as quickly as possible. The second is when they are switching to a new ship, which is quite self-explanatory. However, it must be said that both situations are very rare."



"Wait," Roland frowned, "You mentioned acquiring new ships... So where do those ships come from?"



"Clearwater Port, Seawindshire, Northlook Cape. Only the coastal cities have shipyards, and only they can build ships."



"So 'you can't find such a deal in Willow Town' means this," Roland fell silent for a moment. Buying a ship in a port city was too far away, and without hiring a crew, who would help him sail the ship back? "Since that's the case, I'll consider it further."



After the assistant minister left, the prince fell into deep thought.



In the strategic plan he had devised, shipping was an indispensable link. Without fast and convenient ship transport, he would be unable to carry out a pincer attack with his cannons. The troops of Duke Stronghold were generally conscripted farmers, knights, and mercenaries, and their marching speed could not be very fast—it was just that he was even slower. As Carter had said, relying purely on land transport, a single mud pit could stop the cannons in their tracks—road transport in this era was not paved with asphalt, and there weren't even cobblestone roads. It was just a path pressed out by the frequent passage of people. It was alright on sunny days, but it would become unbearably muddy when it rained.



In the end, would he have to build it himself?



Roland spread out a piece of paper, recording the specifications he required one by one.



Firstly, it needed to be a ship that could carry one or two cannons, along with about thirty people; the ship could be without any power and propelled by sails. Secondly, as the ship would be navigating inland waters, it required stability and reliability, not easily capsizable, with a shallow draft. Thirdly, it had to be easy to operate, so that the militia could quickly learn to handle it after a short period of training.



Combining all these points, there was only one answer left... a flat-bottomed barge.



In Roland's world before he crossed over, this type of vessel with an extremely low draft and low center of gravity could be seen everywhere, almost covering every major river route. Those ships that were piled with river sand or gravel, with their gunwales nearly level with the water surface, were flat-bottomed barges. With just one tugboat, they could pull several barges forward, just like a train.



Once the type of ship was decided, the next key point was choosing which materials to use for construction.



Roland wrote down three options on the paper: wood, iron, cement.



Building ships out of wood is the earliest maritime technology tree that mankind has lit up, from rafts to sail battleships, from rivers to oceans, wooden ships have been enduring. Unfortunately, Roland did not know how to piece together a flat-bottomed boat with logs, and he did not have the relevant craftsmen either. If they were to force it with just a few carpenters, it would likely end up as a large raft, and the kind that might fall apart at any moment.



As for iron ships, the construction is similar to building a house, with main and secondary beams crisscrossing to form the keel, then covered with iron sheets. With Anna doing the welding, the overall rigidity is guaranteed. But this method would consume the already scarce iron ore reserves, which, in desperate times, would be more appropriately used for producing steam engines and gun barrels.



That left the cement ship as the last option— the city walls had already been completed, and there were surplus raw materials. Anna only needed to calcine once or twice to obtain enough cement powder. The construction process was also much easier than that of iron ships; all that was needed was to piece together the shape with wooden molds, arrange the iron bars to act as steel reinforcement, and then fill it with cement. Even in the countryside back home, several cement boats could be made for fishing. Compared to iron ships, which need regular rust removal and painting, it would require virtually no maintenance after being built, making it a cheap and durable option. Even if he had never learned how to build ocean-going vessels, constructing a low-technology cement barge for inland rivers shouldn't be a big problem, right?



With a try-and-see attitude, Roland picked up a goose feather quill and quickly sketched out the draft of the barge.



...



A shed with walls was set up by the Redwater River.



To facilitate the launch, Roland positioned the shipbuilding site as close to the riverbank as possible.



The shed could shelter from the wind and snow, and inside there were two basins of charcoal fire to avoid the temperature being too low, which might affect the hardening effect of the cement.



The wooden templates carved out by the carpenter had pieced together the basic outline of the ship's hull—the bow was arc-shaped to reduce resistance moving forward, while the stern was square to increase the load area. The ship was about twenty-four feet (8 meters) in width, with a length-to-width ratio of 3:1, which made it look like a chubby fellow compared to regular vessels with their slender 8:1 proportions. It was designed with twin masts. The mast poles were inserted into the bottom of the ship and connected to the iron beams running along the vessel's centerline. At the stern, there was also a wooden stake erected as a reserved outlet for the rudder. Iron bars were laid crisscross in other places.



It didn't matter that there was no wire for binding, as all the intersections of the iron bars were welded firmly by Anna herself, forming an iron net that spread across the bottom of the ship.



When the 'templates' and 'reinforcement bars' were ready, Roland ordered the workers to start the tamping operation.



The properly mixed cement was poured into the templates basin by basin. The middle was flat, and the sides were about one and a half meters tall, serving as the walls of the ship's hold. At first glance, it looked like a uniquely shaped huge bathtub.



Everyone involved in the construction, including Anna, had not expected that this strange contraption, made from the same materials as the city walls, would actually be a ship.
