## Planning and Entertainment
On a sunny afternoon, Roland fulfilled the promise he had made. He ennobled Titus Pine as a Viscount, with his territory delineated to the south of the Redwater River, facing the small town across the river. At present, the area was still a dense forest, belonging to a region awaiting development. In order to have him give up the autonomous rights within his territory, Roland agreed to prioritize the development of Titus's land and promised that the industries established there would allocate a certain share of profits to the Viscount and his descendants. Of course, Roland used his skills of persuasion to describe it as a good deal where one could earn money without managing the business.



Titus readily agreed to this arrangement—he was never fond of such matters, and in his opinion, nothing was more interesting than riding and fighting. However, now that he had a daughter, he shifted his focus to hunting. Moreover, the industries within Titus's original territories had long been in decline, so he simply asked the prince to help him sell his lands to the east of the stronghold and move his entire family to Border Town. Roland naturally agreed to this request.



Another person was Brian. Roland knighted him and asked whether he would choose land or military service.



If Brian chose land, he would no longer be able to join the First Army of Border Town. If he joined the army, he would have to rise through the ranks based on his military achievements and earn his land as a reward, just like everyone else. Brian did not hesitate to choose the latter.



With these decisions, Roland had a rough blueprint for the land-use planning.



With the Redwater River as the boundary, the land sandwiched between it and the Impassable Mountain Range was designated as the residential area, which was about three kilometers at its narrowest and seven to eight kilometers at its widest. In the future, this area could be used to build residential complexes or awarded as reward land to promoted officers.



On the opposite bank of the Redwater River would be the future industrial and agricultural zones, extending all the way to the southern border. However, the area was still covered by vast forests with undulating hills in the distance. Once the population met the demand, Roland would inevitably start to reclaim this forest land.



The Misty Forest to the west of Border Town was also an important development focus. The forest held all sorts of treasures, such as timber, edible fungi, wildlife, and medicinal herbs. Timber could be used not only for construction and industry but also as fuel. The forest was astonishingly large; Roland had Lightning scout it out, and even after flying thirty kilometers, she could not see the end. Even if it were all used for firewood, it would last for a very long time.



The last area is the wasteland between the Misty Forest and the Impassable Mountain Range—a forbidden zone untouched by humans. Judging by the boundary line between the mountains and the forest, the enclosed territory is extremely vast, almost much larger than the Kingdom of Greycastle. Faced with such an ownerless land, Roland felt an itching desire. But he also knew that he couldn't afford to pay attention to this place for the time being. Right now, what Border Town needed most was population.



Back in the castle office, he summoned the painter, Soraya.



"How's the work assisting the City Hall coming along?"



"I've never drawn so many pictures in a single day," she looked much more spirited than when he first saw her, "I've basically finished everything up to today. Although, it feels a bit strange to only leave a window the size of a head when painting."



"To prevent your magical brush from frightening the townspeople," the prince smiled, "Although they know witches exist, such close contact can still easily lead to accidents, so it's better to take some concealment measures to keep them unaware that you are a witch. It will get better over time."



Soraya's photographic ability brought a whole new level of improvement to Roland's citizen registration plan. The City Hall had cleared out a room to serve as an archive for storing the townspeople's information. Similar to a household register, each sheet contained their names, ages, residences, and blood relations, among other information. These details Barov had once briefly compiled during the winter, and this record-keeping also expanded to include much more content. The biggest change was that every person's household entry now came with a "color photograph."



As per Roland's request, the City Hall constructed a small cabin inside the main hall that could accommodate one person at a time, wrapped in coarse cloth, with only a square window at the front for Soraya to see the person's features. In this way, the witch could paint portraits inside without the other person seeing the magical brush.



As for how to encourage the residents of the territory to eagerly come forward with their information, Roland's method was simple: everyone who came would receive a subsidy of ten Bronze royals—this money was allocated by the City Hall.



"I called you here today because I want you to paint something different." Roland spread out the cut sheets of paper in front of Soraya.



The latter noticed that the size of those pieces of paper was exactly the same, only half the size of a palm, and shaped like a rectangle.

"What do you want me to draw?"

"Some entertainment props," Roland said.

This idea had long existed in his mind; besides practicing every day, the witches had basically nothing else to do, and such a life seemed somewhat dull. It was the same for the prince, especially while waiting for the snow to melt, his range of activities was limited to within the castle. Therefore, coming up with some entertainment activities and finding a few witches to relax with was necessary.

The simplest, of course, was playing cards. However, the soft ordinary paper was not suitable for holding in hand, and shuffling was also troublesome. Now that he had Soraya, he could naturally consider making some more sophisticated things.

"Entertainment?" She tilted her head and thought about it, seemingly not understanding what kind of entertainment drawing on square pieces of paper could be, "Alright, you're in charge."

"First, on this piece of paper, draw a soldier wielding a heavy crossbow."

"Imagination?"

"That's right, his armor, physique, age, including the environment he's in, it's all up to your imagination. As long as he's holding a heavy crossbow, that's fine."



"Uh... I'll give it a try." Soraya closed her eyes, pondered for a moment, and a magic brush with iridescent light appeared in her hand.

Soon, the figure of a middle-aged crossbowman leapt onto the paper.

"Very good," Roland praised, "Let me think about what to draw next, um... In the upper left corner and the center of the paper, draw a small circle in each," he recalled the appearance of those cards in his mind, "The first circle should have a white background with a golden edge, and the second circle an orange background with a golden edge."

After these were finished, Roland asked her to add a number inside the first circle, and a bow and arrow symbol inside the second circle.

The magical aspect of Soraya's ability was that she could paint regardless of the material, so blank paper and patterned paper made no difference to her, and the later patterns could perfectly cover the former, just like layers of coverage.

Thus, a delicate 'Crossbowman Card' appeared before Roland.

"Is this good?" she asked.

"This is just one unit card; there are many similar cards to be drawn, ultimately forming a full deck, and then I'll teach you how to play."

Watching Soraya paint with her eyes closed, Roland had a premonition that such conversations would soon fill his castle—



"What are you going to do? Come and play a round of Gwent first!"
