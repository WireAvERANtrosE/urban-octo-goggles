## Victory Banquet
In the main hall of the Border Town's castle, a grand celebration banquet was being held.

In addition to the witches, the high-ranking officials from the City Hall and the First Army were also in full attendance. There were nobles like Barov Mons and Carter Lannis, as well as commoners like Iron Axe and Kyle Sichi. Particularly for the latter, Roland had spent a considerable amount of effort to pull him away from the laboratory to attend this "meaningless" banquet, as he had put it.

To let the citizens share in the joy, apart from public speeches, Roland also ordered the kitchen to use the refined starch left over from making explosives to bake a large batch of white bread, which was distributed to the townspeople—anyone with an identity card could pick up a limited portion of this delicacy at the City Hall. Most of the town had already learned of the victory in battle even before the First Army had made their way home.

Of course, they might not understand the purpose and significance of this expedition, but free bread was enough reason for a day of celebration.

This was also the first time Roland held an "elegant" banquet modeled after the ones in the King's City.

There were no barbecues or large chunks of stewed meat; all the food was cut into small pieces and served on pristine white plates. There were bowls filled with a variety of condiments on the side, allowing everyone to dip according to their own taste, similar to the buffet restaurants of later generations.

"Welcome back," he said, walking towards Anna with two glasses of fruit wine, "You must be tired from the journey."

"You've already said that at the dock," Anna replied, taking the glass, "And my answer is still the same, it wasn't hard."

Their glasses clinked gently, and with sweet laughter shining in the girl's eyes, Roland resisted the urge to embrace her on the spot, instead raising his glass to celebrate with the other witches.



"What about me? What about me?" Lightning clamored.



"You have a share too," Roland called to a squire serving wine and took down a cup of apple cider, "You've worked hard."



"I want the clear stuff!" the little girl looked up and said.



"Uh..." He thought for a moment and finally agreed to her request. This little devil's curiosity was always particularly strong. If he kept refusing, she might end up imitating Nightingale, sneak into the kitchen and steal some wine to drink, "Alright, but you can only have one cup."



"Mhm!"



As Roland handed her a cup of low-degree white wine with ice cubes and grape juice, she suddenly leaned in and kissed him on the cheek.



"Cough cough... Is this also a custom of the Fjords?"



"That's right," Lightning nodded vigorously, "My dad said so!"



Since this was not their first time witnessing such an act, the witches didn't find it too strange. However, people like Sylvie widened their eyes, and then they all looked at Roland with accusing eyes, causing him to turn his head away in quite an embarrassed manner—Was there really such a custom in the Fjords to offer a kiss to the leader during a victory celebration?



Next was toasting to his own subordinates.



When it was the turn of the Chief Alchemist, he leaned over and asked in a low voice, "Your Highness, I've read the 'Intermediate Chemistry' you gave me twice now, but there are still many things I don't understand."



"It discusses the microscopic composition of matter, which involves a lot of physics knowledge. You need to combine it with another book." Roland advised, "I suggest you read 'Elementary Physics' entirely first, and then start over with the chemistry manuscript. In this way, many of your doubts will be clarified."



"That was my plan as well, however..." he hesitated, "Your Highness, why is each ancient tome's cover a different color? Do they have some special meaning?"



"Well..." Roland pondered for a moment, "The color represents its level and the difficulty of acquiring it."



"Is that so?" Kyle mused, "From green to purple, it seems that the deeper the color, the more profound the knowledge it contains. So, 'Advanced Chemistry' must be black, right?"



"No, it's orange."



"Ah?" Kyle was taken aback, "Why is that?"



Roland smiled, "Who knows."



Halfway through the banquet, he stepped out of the hall onto the castle terrace. With the evening breeze gently blowing, Roland couldn't help but feel a chill. Autumn was already halfway gone, he realized, and before long, the long cold winter brought by the Evil Months would cover the entire Western Territory.



However, this year was starkly different from the last. Trade with the Margrave Commerce Guild brought in a large amount of liquid assets. These Gold royals, besides being exchanged for food and supplies, a considerable portion was distributed as wages to the subjects. According to the statistics from the Convenience Market, sales of various goods had increased recently, and items that could noticeably improve the quality of life, such as steaks and eggs, had a particularly rapid growth in sales.



Without a doubt, this was an indication that the living standards of the subjects were gradually improving. Especially the original inhabitants, who now had new free housing, began to try purchasing delicacies that were previously only enjoyed during festivals after their salaries had increased significantly. The newly introduced population was still in the phase of saving money to buy houses, and once they could settle down stably, the market would surely welcome a new sales peak.



What do people really need? Sometimes, just having enough food and drink was all it took for them to feel grateful to their lord and follow him unto death.



In this era, most commoners were easily satisfied.



"Your Highness, be careful not to catch a cold," Nightingale appeared from behind, holding a thin leather jacket in her hand. She tossed the jacket to Roland, casually pulled out a piece of dried fish, and stood beside him, "What are you thinking about here?"



"Nothing much," he said with a smile, draping the jacket over his shoulders, "I just suddenly wanted to take a look at my territory."



"The town seems quite lively," Nightingale pointed towards the brightly lit square, "It's already evening, and there are still so many people who haven't gone home."



"Because today is the first performance of the new drama 'Dawn'," Roland curled the corner of his mouth, "and it is also the troupe's first show back in the town after being away for several months. The people probably can't wait to see Miss May and Lady Irene again."



However, speaking of which, Miss May will soon become Lady May · Lannis. He really didn't expect that his Chief Knight would act so swiftly to win over the Star of the Western Region. When the other party earnestly brought it up to him, he was stunned for quite a while before he realized. The Chief Knight's wedding needed the approval of his liege lord, and Roland, of course, had no objections to such delightful news. In the end, the date of their wedding was set for after the end of the Evil Months, which was also the day Border Town would be officially established as a city.



"The first time I sneaked into the town, it was a lifeless place," Nightingale sighed, "but now, even standing in the castle, it feels like I can sense their joy."



"Life always gets better day by day." Roland lifted his head to look at the cloudless, sparkling night sky and took a deep breath. There was still so much to do, such as expanding the scope of education, establishing public healthcare, strengthening cultural construction, encouraging childbirth, and so on... All these would transform into the solid power of the Western Region, laying the foundation for the unification of Greycastle.



"What about us?" Nightingale tilted her head and asked with a sly look in her eyes.



"Of course, the same goes for us," Roland patted her head, "I promise."
