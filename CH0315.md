## Victory Banquet
A grand celebration banquet was being held in the hall of the lord of Border Town.



In addition to the witches, the entire senior staff of the City Hall and the First Army attended, including the nobility-born Barov Mons and Carter Lannis, as well as the commoner-born Iron Axe and Kajen Troupe. Especially the latter, Roland had spent a great deal of effort to pull him from the laboratory to attend this "meaningless" feast, as he called it.



To have the subjects share in the feeling of triumph, besides the public speech, he also ordered the kitchen to use the refined starch left over from making explosives to bake a large batch of white bread, which was distributed to the townspeople—as long as they showed their identification card, they could collect a limited portion of the delicious bread at the City Hall. Most of the townspeople had already learned of the victory in battle while the First Army was still on its way home.



Of course, they might not understand the purpose and significance of this expedition, but free bread was enough reason for them to celebrate.



This was also the first "elegant" banquet Roland had hosted in imitation of the capital's style.



There was no barbecue or large chunks of stewed meat; all the food was cut into small pieces and presented on pristine white plates. Bowls filled with a variety of condiments were placed on the side, allowing everyone to dip according to their own taste, similar to a buffet restaurant in later times.



"Welcome back," he said, approaching Anna with two glasses of fruit wine in hand, "You've had a hard journey."



"You've already said that, at the dock," Anna replied, taking the glass, "And my response is the same, it wasn't hard."



Their glasses clinked gently, and a sweet smile brimmed in the girl's eyes. Roland resisted the urge to embrace her right then and there, and instead raised his glass to the other witches to celebrate.



"What about me? What about me?" Lightning clamored.



"You have a part too," Roland called over a servant to bring drinks and took a cup of apple cider, "Thank you for your hard work."



"I want the clear one!" the little girl said, looking up.



"Uh..." He thought for a moment, and finally agreed to her request. This little rascal's curiosity was always particularly strong. If he kept refusing, she might end up imitating Nightingale, sneaking into the kitchen to steal drinks, "Alright, but you can only have one glass."



"Mhm!"



Just as Roland handed her a glass of low-alcohol white wine with ice and grape juice, she suddenly leaned in and kissed him on the cheek.



"Cough cough... Is this another custom from the Fjords?"



"Yes," Lightning nodded vigorously, "My daddy said so!"



Since it wasn't the first time they had seen this, the witches didn't find it too strange. However, Sylvie and others widened their eyes, then they all looked at Roland with accusing eyes, making him awkwardly turn his head away—Does the Fjords really have such a custom of kissing the leader during a victory celebration?



Next is to toast to my subordinates.



When it was the turn of the Chief Alchemist, he leaned over and asked in a low voice, "Your Highness, I have read through 'Intermediate Chemistry' twice, but there are still many parts I do not understand."



"It discusses the microscopic composition of substances, which involves a lot of physical knowledge. You need to combine it with another book," Roland advised. "I suggest you go through 'Elementary Physics' completely first, and then read the chemistry book from the beginning again. This way, many of your doubts will be resolved."



"That's what I was planning to do, but..." he hesitated, "Your Highness, why does each ancient book have a different color cover? Do they have any special meaning?"



"Well..." Roland pondered for a moment, "The color represents its level and the difficulty in obtaining it."



"Is that so?" Kyle pondered, "From green to purple, it seems that the deeper the color, the more profound the knowledge recorded. So, 'Advanced Chemistry' must be black, right?"



"No, it's orange."



"Ah?" Kyle was stunned, "Why?"



Roland smiled, "Who knows?"



The banquet was more than halfway through when he stepped out of the great hall and came to the castle terrace. Under the gentle breeze of the evening, Roland couldn't help but feel a chill. Autumn was already half over, and he realized that before long, the long winter brought on by the Evil Months would cover the entire Western Region.



However, this year was completely different from the last. Trade with the Margaret Chamber of Commerce had brought in a large amount of liquid capital. These Gold royals, apart from being exchanged for food and supplies, a considerable portion was distributed among the subjects as wages. According to statistics from the Convenience Market, sales of various goods had increased recently, and items that could significantly improve the quality of life, such as meat and eggs, had seen a rapid increase in sales.



There was no doubt that this was a sign of the gradually improving living standards of the subjects. Especially the natives, who now had new free housing and received much higher wages than before, began to try purchasing delicacies that they could only enjoy during festivals. The newly introduced population was still in the stage of saving money to buy houses. Once they were able to settle down steadily, the market would surely welcome a new sales peak.



What do people really need? Sometimes, just being well-fed and well-drinked, they would be grateful to their lord and follow him to death.



In this era, most commoners were easily satisfied.



"Your Highness, be careful not to catch a cold," Nightingale appeared from behind, holding a thin leather jacket in her hand. She tossed the coat to Roland and casually took out a piece of dried fish, standing beside him, "What are you thinking about here?"



"Nothing much," he smiled and put on the jacket, "I just suddenly wanted to take a look at my territory."



"The town seems quite lively," Nightingale pointed towards the bright square, "It's already night, and there are still so many people who haven't gone home."



"Because today is the first performance of the new play 'Dawn,'" Roland curled his lips into a smile, "and it is also the first show the troupe has put on in the town after being away for several months. The people must be eager to see Miss May and Lady Irene again."



However, speaking of which, it won't be long before Miss May becomes Mrs. May Lannis. He had not expected his Chief Knight to act so swiftly and win over the Star of the Western Region. When the latter sincerely brought it up to him, he was stunned for quite some time before he grasped it. The wedding of the Chief Knight required the approval of the lord he served, and naturally, Roland had no objections to such joyful news. In the end, their wedding was set for the day after the Evil Months, which was also the day Border Town would be officially established as a city.



"The first time I sneaked into the town, it was a lifeless place," Nightingale remarked with a sigh, "Now, even standing in the castle, it feels like I can sense their joy."



"Life always gets better day by day." Roland lifted his head, looking up at the clear, sparkling night sky, taking a deep breath. There was still so much he needed to do, such as expanding education, establishing public healthcare, strengthening cultural development, encouraging childbirth, and so on... All of these would transform into the solid strength of the Western Region, laying the foundation for the unification of Greycastle.



"What about us?" Nightingale asked, tilting her head and looking mischievous.



"Of course, the same applies," Roland patted her head, "I promise."
