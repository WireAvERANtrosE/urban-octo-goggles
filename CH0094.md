## Forced demolition requires no reason.
The production of the cannons was steadily advancing; the second barrel had entered the stage of boring, while the third cannon was still in the process of material accumulation.

With some luck, in a month's time, he would have a splendid lineup of four twelve-pound cannons. The advantage in firepower was beyond doubt, but how to convert this advantage into victory was a problem Roland had been pondering.

Before crossing over, he had been merely a mechanical engineer, and like most people, his understanding of war came from history, movies, and games. If it were a complete cold-weapon war, he would hand it over to Carter and Iron Axe to command. But this battle was different; no one understood the combat methods of firearms better than himself.

Given this, he could only integrate all the knowledge he possessed and use a perspective beyond this era to plan every step.

To ensure victory, Roland had Lightning travel back and forth between the stronghold and Border Town every day. One reason was to observe the condition of the roads, and the other was to accurately calculate the distance. Roland believed that victory in war was built upon ample reconnaissance and calculations. Whether it was devising tactics or deducing the battle situation, these two points were indispensable.

Using the dimensions set during the last cannon casting, he made several one-meter-long iron rods and a hundred meters of hemp rope. Then, on the west side of the Border Town artillery testing ground, he used the hemp rope and wooden rods to mark out a flight runway approximately one kilometer long. Lightning then practiced controlling her magic power consumption, repeatedly traversing this one-kilometer distance at a fixed speed.

Once she had memorized the output of magic power at this level, Roland began to measure the distance from the stronghold to the town. Using the time it took to travel back and forth obtained by a sundial, he calculated that the distance between the two was roughly fifty-four kilometers.

Of course, this was just the straight-line distance; in reality, the land route had to take two large detours to avoid the foothills extending from the Impassable Mountain Range. Regardless, if the Duke chose to march overland, he would need at least three days to reach Border Town.

With Lightning as the scout, Roland could clearly understand the enemy's position and the actions he should take.



Within two kilometers to the west of the town, he had already planted numerous markers to signal distance. As long as the enemy entered this range, the artillery team could adjust the corresponding cannon angles quickly without the need for a firing table.



Now he was starting to worry—what if the enemy didn't come at all?



Just then, there was a knock on the door.



Nightingale, who had been lying on the couch and chewing on dried fish, disappeared in an instant. Roland coughed twice and said, "Come in."



The one who pushed open the door was Minister Assistant Barov, "Your Highness, a noble from Longsong Stronghold wishes to see you."



"Who?" Roland didn't react for a moment, "Did they send another envoy?"



"No, not an envoy," Barov shook his head, "It's Baron Coleis who left before the Evil Months and has now returned."



It took Roland a moment to remember that there indeed were stronghold nobles residing in Border Town before. But they dared to come back? And to come running over just as spring began—had they not experienced the iron fist of the royal autocracy? "What does he want to see me for?"



"His house was demolished for obstructing the city wall defenses," the Minister Assistant spread his hands, "If you don't wish to see him, I can help you refuse."



Roland initially wanted to agree, but after thinking it over, he changed his mind, "Have the baron wait for me in the parlor."



Maybe through him, I can put a little pressure on the Longsong Stronghold side, the prince thought.



After dawdling for a quarter of an hour, Roland leisurely made his way to the parlor. On one side of the long table, a round-bellied man who had already been waiting with some impatience was pacing back and forth, his cheeks trembling with each step. Only when he saw His Highness did the baron stop and, with some effort, bent over to give a bow.



"Please, take a seat," Roland said as he returned to the main seat. Normally, even if it wasn't mealtime, he would have the kitchen serve some dessert, but today, he didn’t even bother to prepare tea.



"Your esteemed Highness," Baron Kokoris began hastily before his buttocks had even settled, "how could you let those foolish masons tear down my house! It was a fine residence, with a protective wall built from stone bricks below, and the beams and roof were made from the best quality timber. At the time of its construction, it cost me one hundred... no, one hundred and fifty Gold Royals!" He gestured with his fingers.



One hundred and fifty, Roland scoffed inwardly. If this had been just after his arrival in Border Town, relying solely on the prince's memories, he might actually have believed it. But now... "Are you referring to that house at the very west end of the town?"



Kokoris nodded vigorously, "Yes, yes, exactly that one. It was the second largest house in town, only next to Baron Simon's residence."



"That is indeed regrettable, it was too close to the city wall and obstructed the passage of my subordinates," Roland paused for a moment, "However, the city hall has already made compensation."



"How... how much?"



Roland extended two fingers, "Twenty gold royals."



"That's too little! Your Highness..." Colest opened his mouth as if he wanted to argue something but eventually held back. He pulled out a handkerchief to wipe the sweat beads on his forehead, "Alright, twenty it is then. Where should I go to collect this money?"



"Collect?" Roland feigned confusion, "This sum has already been paid out to the owner of the residence."



"What? Wait, wait a moment... I am the owner of the residence!"



"Not you, it's Iron Axe, the captain of my Militia Second Unit."



"Who is that?" the baron started shouting, "Your Highness, you've made a mistake! I am the owner of that house!"



"Is that so? But I didn't see you there in the winter," Roland raised his eyebrows, "How can that house be said to be yours?"



"Of course, I went back to Longsong Stronghold. Who would want to stay in this damned place? A moment's carelessness and you could end up feeding the demonic beasts!"



Idiot, Roland thought to himself, maintaining a calm tone in his speech, "So you mean to say that you fled in fear of the demonic beasts, abandoning your own lordship?"



"Uh, I..." The baron was suddenly at a loss for words.



"Guards." Roland clapped his hands, and immediately two personal guards entered from outside the parlor and flanked Colest.



"Your Highness, what is the meaning of this!?"



"It's quite simple, now you have two choices," Roland stood up from his seat, looking down on him contemptuously, "One is that you admit you were wrong, that house doesn't belong to you at all, and I can consider this whole episode a farce, allowing you to leave now. The second is that during the Evil Months, you betrayed your own lord, and without permission, you disgracefully fled to the Longsong Stronghold. I will throw you into jail and then have you hanged for desertion. Which will it be?"



Sweat kept breaking out on Colest's forehead, he swallowed his saliva, and after hesitating for a long time, he finally said in a trembling voice, "Your Highness, I... I was mistaken, that wasn't my house."



"So it was a misunderstanding," Roland shrugged his shoulders and said to the guards, "Escort Mr. Baron out of here."



As Colest reached the door, the prince called out to him, "Oh, and when you take the ship back to the stronghold, do me a favor and carry a message for me. Tell those... um, nobles who might have the same misunderstanding as you. If they aren't planning to choose the second option, there's no need for them to waste their time making a special trip to the town."



"As you wish, Your Highness," Colest said as he left, forcing a smile, but the moment he turned around, Roland saw the gritted teeth expression on his face.



With that, there will probably be quite an uproar at the stronghold, won't there? he thought.
