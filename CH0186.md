## Star of the Theater (Part 2)
Upon seeing the other person, May immediately abandoned the thought of returning right away.

"My goodness, May... May!" Irene exclaimed in disbelief as she approached, then grabbed her hand and pulled her in front of the knight, "My dear, do you know who she is? She's the most famous actress of the Fortress Theater, Miss May! People would line up from the theater hall to the street just to see her perform!"

Though the term "my dear" made May's heart skip a beat, years of acting instinctually made her smile and nod slightly, "Hello."

"Of course, I know her. You just said she's the most famous actress. Who among the Western Region's nobility doesn't know the name of the star of the theater?" he sighed and apologized to May, "My wife was impolite. I am Phyllis, hello."

He did not give his full name, his status, or even his family name. A wave of sorrow surged in May's heart, but she still maintained the most graceful demeanor, "I know you. The 'Morning Light' of the Western Region, Sir Phyllis Hilt. I am truly sorry I couldn't attend your wedding with Irene due to a tight rehearsal schedule."

"That's all in the past," the knight said with a light smile and a shake of his head, "I am now a teacher, no longer a member of the Hilt family, there's no need for such courtesy." He then waved to the others, "Let's go back and talk. The place you will be staying has already been applied for."

A teacher? May was stunned. Was he referring to a court tutor? The lord of this little town was indeed a prince, but even a down-and-out prince wouldn't have a knight serve in that position, right? And what did he mean by applying for a temporary residence? Shouldn't Irene be leading them to a local, safe, and reliable inn?

Before she could ponder these questions, Irene had already come close, "My goodness, I really didn't expect you to come here. If 'Cinderella' were performed by you, it would definitely cause a sensation!"

"Really?" May was noncommittal, a play name she had never heard of, probably written by some new playwright. Moreover, she didn't have the time to rehearse a play. Coming here... she just wanted to see how the 'Morning Light' was doing, and perhaps there was a way she could offer help.



After entering the town, May noticed something amiss—this place was obviously a barren town situated beyond the border, serving as a fortress outpost, so why did it look like an emerging city? The roads were paved with gray-black gravel, not a speck of mud in sight, and the streets were too wide, almost wide enough for two carriages to pass side by side.



"What kind of road is this?" Sam voiced the confusion in her heart. "It feels strangely flat."



"Hehe," Irene said with pride, "When I first came here, it was all mud. It only changed to this recently. And this is not just a road; according to the stonemasons, this is just the foundation."



"They're pulling your leg," Rosia retorted. "Only houses need foundations. Something lying on the ground isn't going to collapse—what need is there for a foundation?"



"Really, they mix a kind of gray powder with stones to level it, then sprinkle water on it and roll it with a stone roller until the ground is flat. I thought this was a new way of road construction, but the stonemason said this was a method instructed by His Highness the Prince, seems like it's called... something-something layer, anyway, it's the foundation!" Irene led the way at the front, her hands behind her back, and her long braid swinging to and fro, "In the future, when there are more people and carriages passing by, they will pave the surface with stone slabs. That will be the real road."



Stone slab surfaces, May sneered inwardly, aside from the inner city of the King's City, which city could afford to pave an entire area with stone slabs? Having such wide and flat roads was good enough. Even inside Longsong Stronghold, there were still many muddy areas.



As they went deeper into the town, she saw that many houses on both sides of the road were being demolished, both mudbrick and wooden houses. Although they were not new houses, they were far from uninhabitable, "Are they being demolished because they're blocking the street, and the lord is driving them away?"



"No, they've all moved to the community housing."



"Community housing?" May inquired, "What is that?"



"The newly built residential area has all the identical brick and stone houses," Irene explained. "All the original residents will get one, and by then, there won't be any leaky, drafty shacks left in the town."

Brick and stone houses for everyone? May could hardly believe her own ears. Was this even more extravagant than stone-paved roads? Did she have any idea how much it cost to build these houses? Since it wasn't appropriate to make a fuss in front of Phyllis, May had to swallow her words.



There were many people on the street, and they would occasionally stop to greet Irene and Phyllis. May noticed that Irene seemed to be some kind of teacher as well.



"Aren't you supposed to perform a play here?" she asked. "Why do the townsfolk call you Teacher Irene?"



"That's my job, and the drama is just a part-time gig. The town doesn't have a theater," Irene explained the Prince's summons to them, "Even though it's an open-air performance and the audience is commoners, the pay is calculated according to the fortress's standards. I think it's a good opportunity, at least it's a chance to improve myself."



"Yes, yes, I'm satisfied just to be able to perform on stage," Gatro and Sam nodded in agreement.



An open-air performance for commoners! May was speechless. She couldn't understand what the Prince, who had come up with this idea, was trying to achieve. Could those people, who lived day to day just for food, understand the love and twists in the drama?



And so, the group arrived in front of a two-story building.



"This is the Teachers' Building, but currently Border Town only has nine teachers, so there are still quite a few empty rooms. Phyllis has applied for two sets of temporary accommodation for you. You'll stay here during the performance," Irene handed out two keys, "Gatro and Sam in one room, and Lorgar and Tilly in another, um, Miss May..."



"I'll stay with you," May said.

"But..."

"I came here to see how the companions from the theater are doing," she said with a smile, "after all, we've worked together at the theater for so long, and it's very likely that you will never return to the fortress. I want to talk to you more. You wouldn't mind, would you?"

"Of course not!" Irene happily took her hand. "I'm just worried that the room is too small and you might not be used to it. I have so many things about the performances that I want to ask for your advice on!" Having said that, she turned her head to address the other four, "Let's put our luggage down first, then come to my place and sit for a while, we can read through the script together."

May climbed to the second floor, following Irene and Ferlin into their new home.

Her last bit of hope was also dashed.

Though she didn't want to admit it, this small house did indeed exude a sense of comfort and cleanliness. The tablecloths and curtains were obviously newly purchased, all made of thin red and white cotton fabric, and the floors were swept clean. There was even a piece of linen carpet laid out in the living room. On the low table in the living room, there were several peculiar cups that immediately caught May's attention. She walked over and picked one up to examine it closely, finding herself momentarily unable to recognize the material—it was lightweight, somewhat like wood, but the surface was smooth and the colors were rich and vibrant, not at all like the cheap goods affordable to commoners. The cups also had patterns on them, seemingly depicting two puppets intimately pressed together.

"Beautiful cups, right?" Irene said, coming over. "They're just too expensive, selling for five Silver royals each at the Convenience Market, and they come in sets of four with different postures of people on them. Ferlin insisted on buying them to celebrate payday, and ended up spending all his wages. That fool."

"Convenience Market?" May deliberately ignored the latter part of the sentence.



"Mm!" she nodded. "The lord has set up a market in the town square selling some very exquisite everyday items, though the prices are not low at all. I can take you to see it tomorrow."



May's heart was filled with mixed feelings; everything was completely different from what she had imagined. She had thought that as a knight who had been defeated and captured, with no ransom to her name, even if she were released by the lord, her days would surely be very hard. Irene had always had little in the way of savings, so apart from sharing his hardships, she could not help him in any way.



At this time, any aid she could offer would be like sending charcoal in snowy weather to Phyllis Hilt. If she could go a step further and use her own influence to persuade the local lord to redeem the First Knight, maybe she could completely turn the knight's heart around.



But... she found that all her assumptions were wrong, and he didn't need her help at all to live a good life in Border Town.



So, should she go back? Choose to leave this place and forget about Phyllis and Border Town altogether.



May was plunged into confusion.
