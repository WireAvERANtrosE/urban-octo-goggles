## Star of the Theater (Part 2)
The moment May saw the other party, she immediately abandoned the idea of returning right away.



"Oh my, May!" Irene exclaimed in disbelief as she approached, then grabbed her hand and pulled her in front of the knight, "Dear, do you know who she is? She's the most famous actress at the Stronghold Theater, Miss May! There are people who would queue up from the theater hall to the streets just to see her perform!"



Although the term "dear" made May's heart skip a beat, years of acting instinctively made her lift the corners of her mouth slightly and nod her head slightly, saying, "Hello."



"Of course, I know her, you just said she's the most famous actress. Who among the Westland nobility doesn't know the name of the Star of the Theater," he sighed, apologizing to May, "My wife was impolite. I am Philip, hello."



He didn't announce his title, his status, or even his surname. A wave of sadness rose in May's heart, but she still maintained the most graceful demeanor, "I know you. The first knight of the Westlands, 'Dawn's Light' Sir Philip Hilt."



"All that is in the past," the knight said with a light smile and a shake of his head, "I am now a teacher, and no longer of the Hilt family, you need not be so formal." After saying this, he waved to the others, "Let's go back and talk. The place where you will be staying has already been arranged."



A teacher? May was taken aback. Did he mean a court tutor? The lord of this small town was indeed a prince, but even a down-and-out prince wouldn't resort to having a knight take on this role. And what did he mean by applying for a temporary residence? Shouldn't Irene be taking the group to a local, safe, and reliable inn?



Before she had time to think about these questions, Irene had already come over, "Oh my, I really didn't expect you to come here. If 'Cinderella' were to be performed by you, it would definitely cause a sensation!"



"Is that so?" May responded noncommittally to a drama title she had never heard of, probably written by some new playwright. Moreover, she didn't have time to rehearse a play; she came here... just to see how Dawn's Light was getting on, and perhaps she might be able to help him in some way.



After entering the town, May noticed something was off—this was supposed to be a barren town located beyond the border, acting as a stronghold outpost. Why did it look like an emerging city? The roads were paved with gray-black crushed stones everywhere, not a bit of muddy ground in sight, and the streets were too wide, almost wide enough for two carriages to pass through side by side.



"What kind of road is this?" Sam voiced the doubts in her heart. "It's strangely flat."



"Hehe," Irene smiled proudly, "When I first came here, it was all mud. It has only changed to this recently. And this is not just a road, according to the stonemasons, this is just the foundation."



"They're fooling you," Roach retorted. "Only houses need foundations. Things lying on the ground won't collapse, what foundation do they need?"



"It's true, they mix a kind of gray powder with the stones to pave it, sprinkle water, and then roll it back and forth with a stone roller until the ground is flat. At first, I thought it was a new way of road construction, but the stonemasons said that this is the method instructed by His Highness the Prince, it seems to be called... something layer, anyway, it's the foundation!" Irene led the way at the front with her hands behind her back, her long braid swinging back and forth, "In the future, when there are more people and carts passing by, they will pave the surface with stone slabs, that's what will be the real road."



Stone slabs, May scoffed in her heart. Apart from the inner city of the King's City, which other city could afford to pave an entire area with stone slabs? It would be good enough to have such wide and flat roads. There were still many muddy grounds within the Longsong Stronghold.



As they delved deeper into the town, she saw many houses being demolished on both sides of the road, including mudbrick houses and wooden houses. Although they were not new, they were far from uninhabitable. "Are they being driven away by the lord because they're blocking the street?"



"No, they've all moved to the community."



"Community?" May asked, "What is that?"



"The newly built residential area is filled with identical brick and stone houses," Irene explained, "Every native will get one. By then, there will be no more leaky and drafty shacks in the town."

Brick and stone houses for everyone? May could hardly believe her ears; this was even more extravagant than stone-paved floors. Did she even have any concept of how much it cost to build such houses? Since it was not appropriate to make a fuss in front of Philip, May had no choice but to swallow her words.



There were many pedestrians on the street, who occasionally stopped to greet Irene and Philip. May noticed that Irene seemed to be some sort of a teacher as well.

"Aren't you supposed to be performing a play here?" she asked, "Why do the townspeople call you Teacher Irene?"

"That's my job. Acting is just part-time. After all, the town doesn't have a theater," Irene recounted her summons by His Highness the Prince, "Even though it's an open-air performance and the audience is common folk, the pay is calculated based on the standards of a stronghold. I think it's a good opportunity, at least it allows me to practice."

"Yes, yes, just being able to perform is satisfying enough," Gait and Sam nodded in agreement.

An open-air performance for the common folk! May was at a loss for words. Compared to Irene, she was even more puzzled about what His Highness the Prince who came up with this idea was trying to achieve. Could those who lived day to day just to eat understand the love and twists in a drama?



And so, the group arrived in front of a two-story building.

"This is the Teachers' Building, but since Border Town currently only has nine teachers, there are still quite a few empty rooms. Philip has applied for temporary residence for you two in two of the houses during your performance period. You'll stay here," Irene handed out two keys, "Gait and Sam in one room, Rosia and Tilly in another, and, uh, Miss May..."



"I'll stay with you," May said.

"But..."

"I came here to see how the companions from the theater are doing," she said with a smile. "After all, we have worked together in the theater for so long, and you may never go back to the Stronghold again. I want to talk more with you. You won't mind, will you?"

"Of course not!" Irene happily took her hand. "I'm just worried that the room is too small, and you might not be used to it. I have so many things about acting that I want to ask you about!" After saying that, she turned her head to the other four and said, "Let's put down our luggage first, then go to my house to sit for a while and go through the script in detail."

May climbed to the second floor and followed Irene and Philip into their new home.

Her last bit of hope was also shattered.

Although she didn't want to admit it, this small house indeed had a comfortable and clean feeling. The tablecloths and curtains were clearly newly purchased, all made of thin red and white cotton cloth, and the floor was very clean, with a piece of linen carpet laid out in the living room. On the low table in the living room, there were several peculiar cups that immediately caught May's attention. She walked over and picked one up to take a closer look, and for a moment she could not recognize the material it was made of—it was light in weight, somewhat like wood, but the surface was smooth, and the color was rich and vibrant, not at all like the cheap items that commoners could afford. The cup also had a pattern on it, seemingly two puppets intimately sticking together.

"Beautiful cups, aren't they?" Irene said as she came closer. "They're just too expensive, selling for five Silver Royals each at the Convenience Market, and four make a set. The figures in the patterns are all in different poses. Philip said it was to celebrate payday and insisted on buying them for me, and ended up spending all his salary. That fool."

"The Convenience Market?" May deliberately ignored the latter part of the other's statement.



"Yes!" she nodded, "The market that Lord Roland has set up in the town square sells some very exquisite daily necessities, but the prices are not low at all. I can take you there to have a look tomorrow."

May's heart was filled with mixed feelings, everything was completely different from what she had anticipated. She had thought that as a defeated and captured knight without ransom, even if released by the lord, life would definitely be very difficult. Irene had no savings to speak of, so she could do nothing but share in his hardships.

At this time, any assistance she could offer would be like sending charcoal in snowy weather to Philip Hilt. If she could go further and use her own influence to persuade the local lord to ransom the First Knight, perhaps she could completely turn the knight's heart around.

But... she found that all her assumptions were wrong, the other party did not need her help at all and could live well in Border Town.

So, should she return? Choose to leave this place and forget both Philip and Border Town.

May was lost in confusion.
