## Capital City Bound
The merchant fleet sailed northward along the tributary of the Redwater River, passing Silver City, and entering the grand canal that led to the royal capital.



Tassa remembered reading in the "Chronicles of Greycastle" that two hundred years ago this place was still a wasteland. In order to transport the silver ore mined from the nearby mountains back to the royal capital, King Wimbledon I gathered the Stonemason's Guild and nearly ten thousand laborers, taking twenty years to carve out this canal connecting the capital and the silver mines. Over time, a city gradually formed around the silver mines, which was later named Silver City by the previous king.



However, the scene before him now was hardly associable with the wasteland of two hundred years ago. On both sides of the canal were lush farmlands, and further away, there were clusters of villages. This reminded him of the Kingdom's Main Road in Border Town. By the time that road was completed, the foothills of Impassable Mountain Range would probably also become densely populated.



"Have you heard that you used to be a royal capital resident?" A woman's voice sounded from behind.



Tassa turned his head and saw that it was the owner of the merchant fleet, Margaret. He nodded, "Before becoming a royal guard, I lived in the inner city district."



"How does it feel to return to your homeland?"



"To be honest, it's alright," he said, "If it weren't for His Highness's arrangement, I would rather stay in Border Town. Although the royal capital is bustling, it gives one a feeling of suffocation." This was especially true for the lower nobility, Tassa thought.



"Is that so?" Margaret smiled, "How much do you know about Roland, His Highness?"



"Why do you ask?" The question made him feel a slight chill in his heart.



"I find him to be an incredible person," she paused. "Despite the terrible reputation he had in the capital, you must have heard quite a few rumors about him. But in Border Town... he's nothing like what the rumors suggest. Both his actions and thoughts are inscrutable," she paused again. "If the steam engine is just a testament to his erudition, then why are the soldiers he trained so extraordinary?"



Tassa glanced at the First Army soldiers sitting on the deck—considering that it was best to be as inconspicuous as possible when operating near the capital, they were not equipped with firearms, nor did they wear uniform military attire. Instead, they donned various types of leather armor and carried wooden spears on their backs, appearing more like guards of a merchant convoy. Most of them were far from the Western Region for the first time. Despite looking around curiously and engaging in animated discussions, not a single one removed their shoes or set aside their weapons.



In contrast, several mercenaries hired by the merchant convoy had already retreated into the cabin to avoid the sunlight. The three or four remaining on deck had taken off their shoes, laid their cumbersome weapons aside, and were lying flat in the shade.



"I'm not quite sure either," Tassa said, spreading his hands helplessly. It wasn't that he wanted to hide anything, but he truly didn't know—the Fourth Prince had changed so much since arriving in Border Town, "Perhaps His Highness has been disguising himself all along."



"Is that so..." Margret was noncommittal in her response. After a moment of silence, she suddenly pointed ahead, "Look, there's the capital's city wall. We're almost there."



A hazy blue-gray expanse appeared at the edge of their field of vision. Standing there, one could feel the grandeur of the wall—this was the most outstanding work of the Stonemasons' Guild before its dissolution. In terms of height and thickness, it was unparalleled in Greycastle. It was said that the wall even housed rooms and passages that could accommodate nearly a thousand soldiers, allowing for continuous patrols and rapid reinforcements.



As the city wall came clearly into view, Tassa also noticed the figures of refugees entering his sight.



Large numbers of civilians gathered outside the suburbs of the capital. They had set up makeshift tents along the city wall, with white smoke rising from the fire pits in front of the tents, seemingly boiling wheat porridge. For now, these people had not yet run out of food, and they seemed to be in decent health. However, the capital's relief food supply would definitely not be issued endlessly. Once the nobles had selected the suitable labor force, they would send soldiers to drive these people away.



"What do you plan to do?" Margret asked curiously. "Will you send His Highness's soldiers to spread the word and recruit people?"



"No, that would be inefficient and could easily attract attention," Tassa shook his head, "To get things done in the capital, you either bribe the officials or hire the rats, something you should be quite familiar with."

"Indeed," she laughed, "I was going to give you a reminder, but it seems unnecessary now. So, if you need any funds, just come to me." Margie handed him a token, "As long as you show this, the store manager will contact me immediately. Of course, you can directly withdraw less than a hundred Gold Royals with it."

"Thank you." Tassa took the token—it was a deep red stone, translucent throughout, with a line of unfamiliar text engraved on one end.

"Don't mention it," she chuckled, "His Highness will repay all this money to me with interest."

After arriving at the canal wharf, Tassa instructed the First Army soldiers to wait outside the suburbs for news, avoiding the royal patrol's sight as much as possible, while he entered the city with the merchant convoy. Passing through the city gate, he noticed that the guards were much stricter in their inspections, clearly not wishing for refugees from the Eastern Region to slip into the city.

Entering the city, the first thing that caught his eye was a row of towering gallows.

Four women, their hands bound behind their backs, were hanging there, emitting a rancid smell under the scorching sun, a sight that immediately made Tassa frown.

"Timothy has been hunting witches throughout the city; these are the unfortunate ones who were caught," Margie sighed, "But to say so isn't exactly accurate. Some witches are merely nobles' playthings that they've grown tired of and are taking this opportunity to get rid of. It's hard to say whether it's better to continue being imprisoned in a dark chamber where no light reaches, or to be relieved of suffering like this sooner... Regardless, I hope they find peace."

During his half-year in Border Town, Tassa had come to realize that witches were not the unforgivable sinners the Church proclaimed them to be; aside from having peculiar abilities, they were no different from ordinary people. Judging by their figures, the youngest on the gallows might have been only fourteen or fifteen, which made him feel a sense of suffocation, that uncomfortable feeling of breathlessness returning.



The outer city of the royal capital hadn't changed much from half a year ago, except for the main road facing the city gate which was paved with bluestone, all other branching roads and alleys were still mud paths. The summer sun caused the ground to crack, and whenever a carriage passed by, it would raise a cloud of yellow dust. It was hard to imagine that the kingdom's capital was outdone in municipal construction by a remote little town beyond the Western Region.



After crossing two streets, the caravan made its way to the market district. Tassa and Margret waved goodbye and headed alone into a small alley.



He confidently approached the entrance of "The Underground Hand" tavern and pushed the door open directly.



"Hey! We're only open at night!" someone shouted.



Tassa ignored the call and walked straight up to the bar, speaking in a deep voice to the burly man who was wiping glasses, "Do you remember me?"



"Which crack in the rocks did you jump out from, grasshopper? Didn't you hear the tavern only opens at night?" The burly man said irritably as he put down the glass, his face darkening as he lifted his head. The two barmaids who were arranging tables and chairs also gathered around, "I'm going to count to three—Tassa, Lord Tassa?"



"It's me," Tassa spat to one side, "I have a good business proposition for you."
