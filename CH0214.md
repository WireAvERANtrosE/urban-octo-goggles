## Capital Trip
The merchant fleet sailed north along the tributary of the Redwater River, passing by Silver City and then entering the grand canal that led to the King's City.



Theo remembered having read in the "Chronicles of Greycastle" that two hundred years ago, this place was still a wasteland. In order to transport the silver ore mined from nearby mountains back to the King's City, the first King Wimbledon had convened the Masons' Guild and nearly ten thousand laborers, spending twenty years to carve out this canal connecting the King's City and the silver mine mountains. Consequently, a city gradually formed around the silver mines, which was later named Silver City by the former king.



However, the sight before him now was hard to associate with the wasteland of two hundred years ago. Both sides of the canal were lined with lush farmland, and further away were clusters of villages. This made him involuntarily think of the kingdom's main road in Border Town—once that road was completed, perhaps the foothills of Impassable Mountain Range would also become densely populated.



"Did I hear that you used to live in the King's City?" A woman's voice sounded from behind.



Theo turned his head and found that it was the owner of the merchant team, Margaret. He nodded, "Before becoming a royal guard, I always lived in the inner city area."



"How does it feel to return to your old home?"



"To be honest, it's alright," he said, "If not for His Highness's arrangement, I would rather stay in Border Town. The King's City might be prosperous, but it gives a feeling of suffocation." This was especially true for the lower nobility, Theo thought.



"Is that so?" Margaret smiled, "How much do you know about Prince Roland?"



"Why do you ask?" The question made him feel slightly apprehensive.



"I think he's truly an incredible person. Despite having a terrible reputation in the royal capital, you must have heard many rumors about him. But in Border Town... he's nothing like what the rumors portray, both his actions and thoughts are unfathomable," she paused, "If the steam engine is just proof of his erudition and talent, then why are the soldiers he has trained so extraordinary?"



Theo glanced at the First Army soldiers sitting on the deck—considering they were moving near the royal capital, they needed to be as discreet as possible, so they weren't equipped with firearms or wearing uniform military attire. Instead, they donned various types of leather armor and carried wooden spears on their backs, looking like a mercantile convoy's guard force. Most of them were leaving the Western Region for the first time, and despite looking around curiously and chattering among themselves, not a single one removed their shoes or laid down their weapons.



In contrast, many of the mercenaries hired by the caravan had gone below deck to avoid the sun, and the three or four remaining on the deck had taken off their shoes and set aside their cumbersome weapons, lying down in the shade.



"I'm not quite sure either," Theo spread his hands helplessly. It wasn't that he wanted to hide anything; he genuinely didn't know—ever since the Fourth Prince arrived at Border Town, he had become very different from before, "Perhaps His Highness was always disguising himself."



"Is that so?" Margaret remained noncommittal to his answer. She fell silent for a moment, then suddenly pointed forward, "Look, that's the city wall of the royal capital. We're almost there."



A hazy blue-gray appeared at the edge of their vision, and just standing there, one could feel the grandeur of the walls—this was the most outstanding work of the Stonemason's Guild before it was disbanded. Both its height and thickness were unmatched in Greycastle, and it was said that there were even rooms and passages inside the walls that could accommodate nearly a thousand soldiers to rest, allowing for continuous patrols and rapid reinforcements.



When the city walls clearly appeared before Theo's eyes, the figures of fleeing civilians also came into his view.



Large groups of commoners gathered outside the suburbs of the royal capital, setting up makeshift tents along the city walls. White smoke rose from the fire pits in front of the tents, where it seemed they were cooking oat porridge. For now, these people hadn't run out of food, and they looked fairly healthy. However, the relief food from the royal capital would definitely not be distributed endlessly. Once the nobles had selected suitable laborers, they would send soldiers to drive these people away.



"What do you plan to do?" Margaret asked curiously, "Send His Highness's soldiers to promote and recruit people?"



"No, that would not only be inefficient, but it would also easily draw the attention of others," Theo shook his head, "To get things done in King's City, you either bribe officials or hire rats, you should be quite familiar with this."

"Indeed," she smiled, "I was thinking of giving you a reminder, but it seems unnecessary now. So, if you need money, feel free to come to me." Margaret handed him a token, "As long as you show this, the manager of the shop will contact me immediately. Of course, you can directly withdraw Gold Royals under a hundred with it."

"Thank you." Theo took the token—it was a deep red stone, translucent throughout, with a line of text engraved on one end that he had never seen before.

"Don't mention it," she chuckled, "His Highness will pay all this money back to me, along with the interest."

After arriving at the canal dock, Theo instructed the First Army soldiers to wait outside in the suburbs for news, avoiding the sight of the King's City patrol as much as possible, while he himself entered the city with the merchant caravan. Passing through the city gate, he noticed that the guards were much more stringent in their inspections, clearly not wanting refugees from the Eastern Region to blend into the city.

Upon entering the city, the first thing that caught his eye was a row of towering gallows.

There hung four women with their hands tied behind their backs, emitting a foul stench under the scorching sun, which made Theo frown immediately.

"Timothy has been hunting witches extensively in the city; they are the unfortunate ones who were caught," Margaret sighed, "But that's not entirely accurate, some witches are just nobles who grew tired of them and took this opportunity to get rid of them. It's hard to say whether it's better to continue being imprisoned in a dark room without light or to be released from suffering like this early... In any case, I hope they find peace."

During his half-year in Border Town, Theo had come to realize that witches were not as unforgivable as the Church had proclaimed; aside from having peculiar abilities, they were no different from ordinary people. Judging from their figures, the youngest on the gallows could only be fourteen or fifteen years old, which made him feel suffocated, that breathless sensation returned.



The outer city of King's City hadn't changed much since half a year ago, except for the main road facing the city gate, which was paved with bluestone, the other branching roads and alleys were all muddy. The summer sun caused the ground to show numerous cracks, and whenever a carriage passed by, it would stir up a cloud of yellow dust. It was hard to imagine that the kingdom's capital was actually outdone in municipal construction by a remote little town beyond the Western Region.



After crossing two streets, the caravan headed towards the market area. Theo waved goodbye to Margaret and turned alone into an alley.



He confidently made his way to the entrance of "The Underground Hand" tavern and pushed the door open directly.



"Hey! We're only open at night!" someone shouted.



Theo ignored him and walked straight up to the bar, addressing the brawny man who was busily polishing glasses with a grave voice, "Do you remember me?"



"Who are you, some locust that sprang out of a crack in the rocks? Didn't you hear that the tavern opens only in the evening?" The man put down his glass with impatience, his face darkening as he looked up, and the two tavern maids who were arranging the tables also gathered around, "I'm gonna count to three—wait, Theo, my lord?"



"It's me," Theo spat to the side, "I have a good business proposition for you."
