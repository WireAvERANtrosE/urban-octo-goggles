## Conspiracy (Part 2)
"..." Herman realized there was no escape for him, his only option was to drag his own younger brother down to hell with him. At this point, he actually calmed down, "Is the purpose of your deception to get rid of me?"

"Get rid of you? No, that would be of no help to me, dear brother. I did this out of necessity," Timothy's tone remained calm, as if stating a fact, "If I were to honestly wait for five years, I'm afraid I would be facing our third sister's pirate fleet. Do you know what she has been doing lately?"

Herman shook his head, estimating the distance between himself and the Second Prince. He remembered that his brother had always been very smart from a young age, but not adept at horsemanship and combat. If he could just seize the opportunity to charge and cleave—

"She is building her own army, brother. Honestly, I admire her for taking this step even before the fight for the throne had started, something that even I did not anticipate. We got along so well as children, why has it come to the point where we must kill each other?" he said as he took two steps back, "Like right now, you probably want to split me in half with a single sword strike, don't you?"

"..."

"I know it all, brother. You are just like before, when you want to kill someone, your eyes become terrifying," Timothy sighed, "Let me tell you straight, I want to end the fight for the throne. Otherwise, in five years, I will be waiting for Grace's fleet. She took control of Clearwater Harbor years ago, and while Valencia is suitable for fostering merchants, it is not suitable for nurturing warriors."

"I need an army, an army capable of resisting our third sister's fleet, and this is not something a trading city can provide. Herman Wimbledon, you will be tried tomorrow for deserting your domain and the assassination of the king. I must return to Valencia tonight, before the news of father's tragedy reaches the Eastern Region. I will express my deep sorrow and, as the second in line to the throne, I will assume the crown without refusal. And you, you will be sent to the guillotine for the crime of regicide."

"You...!" Herman screamed as he lunged at his brother, but the distance was too great, his greatsword intercepted by two iron-clad guards, then a numbness in his shin, a short sword piercing through his calf, Herman immediately lost his balance, toppling to the ground. The crowd surged forward, pinning him down, binding him so he could not move.

"A trial? You have the right to judge me? I will reveal everything, let the people who support you know what kind of monster you are!"



"Of course you won't, brother," Timothy said patiently, "The alchemy workshop has a potion called 'Forget-me-not,' which is made from the venom of lizards from the Southern Sandlands and mixed with mare's milk. After drinking it, you will not be able to make any sound. Don't worry, it won't cause you any pain. On the contrary, it has a rich and intoxicating flavor. If you must blame someone, blame our genius sister. If it weren't for her, I would not have taken this step."

He waved his hand at the head of the guards, who nodded, saluted, and dragged the Crown Prince out of the bedroom. The rest of the iron-clad guards filed out, leaving only the Second Prince and Scholar Aung behind.

"Your Highness, the throne is now within your grasp, and I should address you as Your Majesty," Scholar Aung said, bowing.

"You've done well. Once I take the throne of Greycastle, I will fulfill our agreement. However... seeing the miserable state of my brother today, I feel that some agreements should come with an additional guarantee clause."

The color drained from the scholar's face, "Your Highness, you mean—"

"Don't worry, I simply don't want to be betrayed," Timothy said as he pulled out a wax pellet from his bosom, "You've seen these often enough. It takes seven days for the outer shell of the wax pellet to completely dissolve, which is roughly the time it takes for me to travel back and forth between the royal city and the City of Valencia. I've brought you over with the salary of the kingdom's chief astrologer, and I hope no one else offers a higher price to take you away."

"Your Highness... You must be joking," the scholar said, his complexion turning pale. He gritted his teeth and eventually swallowed the wax pellet.

"Smart choice," Timothy nodded with satisfaction, "You may go now."

...



When the sleeping chamber was empty, the Second Prince's face darkened.



He grabbed the porcelain on the bedside table and smashed it fiercely to the ground, shattering it with a ping. Immediately, a guard entered from outside, "Your Highness?"



"Get out!" he roared.



"Yes." The guard quickly bowed his head and left the room, closing the door behind him.



Damn it, things should not have turned out this way!



His plan did not involve killing his father. With the favoritism of Wimbledon III, he only needed to guide him to notice Grace's actions and put a stop to them, and his chess piece was the First Prince, Herman Wimbledon.



Timothy considered his plan foolproof. He lured Herman's mentor, the low-ranking Astrologer Association member, Bachelor Ang, with the position of Chief Astrologer, to write a letter on his behalf to the First Prince. The First Prince took the bait quickly. This also matched Timothy's judgment; his elder brother was stronger in battle but not good at thinking, and he was unwilling to hand over the throne easily.



The following letters step by step stirred up the First Prince's ambition, and Timothy also made preparations for what was to come. When the last letter with the astrological prediction was sent, he secretly returned to the capital and leaked the possible palace coup by the First Prince to his father. Without a doubt, once confirmed, his father would be furious and throw the First Prince into prison, either to be detained until death or to be exiled.



Then, the father would turn his attention to the other children, and Grace, who was vigorously building up military power, would inevitably become the second thorn in his father's side.



But... why did it turn out this way? When Father heard the news I revealed, he actually let out a sinister smile, pulled out the short sword he kept close to his body, and plunged it directly into his own chest!



Everything happened too quickly, Timothy was completely unable to stop it, and could only watch helplessly as his father lost his life.



He weakly sat down by the bedside, feeling for the first time that he was also a pawn in the hands of fate. His father's final smile was like a nightmare, chilling him to the bone. He went over the whole event again and again, including examining the body, but could not find a single clue—why would his father do such a thing?



He even suspected that the man was an impostor, but no matter how hard he looked, he could not find any flaws, even a secret wound on the back matched the one in his memory.



Seeing that Herman was about to arrive at the royal capital, he had no choice but to feign calm, change all the plans, and pin the death of King Wimbledon III on the eldest prince, then use his own position as the second in line to ascend to the throne in advance. As long as the coronation went smoothly, he would no longer be limited by his territory, and could directly mobilize the power of the Duke of the Southern Region to coerce Grace, forcing her to give up Clearwater Harbor.



In this way, the outcome didn't seem much different, but Timothy felt deeply uneasy… as if an invisible hand had already intervened in the struggle for power among Greycastle's upper echelons, and he knew nothing about it.



At this moment, other than firmly grasping the throne, he had no other choice. Timothy Wimbledon swore in his heart, if he found out who was behind this, he would make sure they knew what kind of fate awaited those who angered a king!
