## Premeditation
Theo had been staying in an inn within the inner city these past few days, anxiously waiting for a reply from Border Town.



The towering inner city wall divided the capital into two distinct worlds, with strict control enforced on entry and exit. Whether noble or merchant, a thorough check was required in a small room at the entrance. Anyone showing signs of illness, such as fever, flushing, or black spots, would not be permitted entry. After leaving the inner city, one must return by dusk that day; otherwise, once the sun set and the city gates were locked, one would have to spend the night outside.



Yet, this still could not prevent the spread of the demonic plague. Yesterday, he had heard rumors that a noble within the inner city was infected. If it weren't for the church finally releasing the first batch of Holy Medicine, it was likely that the nobility would have collectively evacuated the capital.



On the sixth day after the letter was sent out, the Margaret Chamber of Commerce finally sent a message. He hurried to the agreed-upon location—a tailor shop—and was then led by a clerk into the basement, where the owner of the chamber had been waiting for a long time.



Margaret was sitting by a low table, on which a bowl of ice mint water was placed, constantly emitting bursts of cold air. Theo, drenched in sweat, sat cross-legged opposite her and immediately felt a cool breeze, which revitalized his spirits.



"Here is the letter His Highness entrusted me to give you." She handed over a folded sheepskin envelope, the seal of which appeared intact.



Theo could hardly wait to open it and took out the letter—it briefly outlined the action plan, news of the First Army's departure, and the tasks he needed to complete. After carefully reading it through, he tucked the letter into his bosom without revealing any emotion and looked at Margaret, "Did His Highness have any requests for you?"



"Nothing in particular, he just entrusted the messenger to deliver this letter—of course, special express message delivery comes with a fee, which I have already recorded in the books."



"Cough cough, I see," Theo cleared his throat, "His Highness needs to transport all the refugees back to the Western Region in a very short time. Therefore, he hopes you can provide a large number of ships for continuous transportation, rather than just one or two fleets."



"Even if they are infected?" Margaret guessed with interest. "I suppose he would not want to turn the entire Western Region into a wasteland, so... has His Highness found a cure for the demonic plague?"



"That's right," he nodded. "In fact, there were already sick people on the first fleet, but it did not break out at that time, and it was only discovered when they arrived at the town. Now they are on their way back to the King's City, and all the crew members are safe and sound."



"Prince Roland is indeed an incredible person, even the Church hasn't come up with a remedy that quickly," Margaret marveled. "So how many days does he plan to use to transport the refugees? A week?"



Theo held up three fingers.



"This... that's impossible!" The female merchant was stunned for a moment, and quickly shook her head repeatedly, "Even if half of these people died, there would still be more than five thousand people. To finish the transport in three days means I need to prepare nearly a hundred sailboats. Even if I stopped all other shipments of the Merchants Guild to use for transport, it would just barely meet this number—but as a result, my losses might be in the thousands of Gold Royals, not to mention the customers lost, which are immeasurable. Even if the steam engines were free, it couldn't offset this amount. So... please forgive me for declining."



"If everyone sits on the deck, instead of lying in berths, a ship can carry twice as many people," Theo insisted. "If we're not particular about comfort, the two-masted sailboats used for transporting ore can also be used to carry people. Just by opening the hatch, one can load about two hundred people at a time. Your old friend Hogg should have quite a few of these ships, right?"



"In Silver City, he indeed has several such large ships..." Margaret seemed hesitant. "And according to your calculations, it might reduce the number of ships needed to about fifty. But... it's not a good deal."



Theo felt the same way. To get dozens of ships to gather on the canal, just the scheduling and coordination would require a lot of effort, and the cost of chartering the ships wouldn't all go into his own pocket. It was a troublesome and labor-intensive task with little gain; it couldn't be considered a good deal by any means. At this point, he could only resort to his last move.



At the end of the letter, His Highness wrote a line in small print: If Margaret is unwilling to provide assistance, tell her that Lightning has come as well.



This statement was somewhat baffling—could it be that the merchant woman had some special relationship with that lively and adorable blonde girl? They didn't look alike at all from their appearance... But His Highness must have his reasons for saying so. With this in mind, Theo slowly began to speak, "Being forced to move everything within three days is a last resort. What His Highness is doing is akin to snatching food from the jaws of a tiger. If it drags on too long, the Church might come knocking—especially since Lightning is also in this team, and it would be dangerous if they discovered the presence of a witch."



"What did you say?" Her voice suddenly rose an octave, "Lightning is here too?"



"His Highness indeed mentioned it in his letter," Theo put on an honest face, "Probably to lead the way for the team and to provide early warnings. After all, this is Prince Timothy's territory."



"I see," Margaret stood up, "When do you need the ships?"



"They should be needed four days from now, assuming there are no delays on the road."



"I'll try my best to arrange that," she walked over to her writing desk and began to write quickly, "However, I have one condition—you must tell me the location where His Highness's team is stationed. If they want to enter the city, I can also arrange enough rooms."



Well, it seemed that this tactic was indeed effective, "I think that shouldn't be a problem," Theo said with concealed joy, "Additionally, I have another matter that requires your assistance."



"Go on," Margaret sighed.



"I need a team of horse-drawn carriages to transport barrels, the more the better. But don't fill them with ale or wine, instead fill them with river water or well water." According to what His Highness wrote in his letter, the key figure in dealing with the pestilence was still the witch Lily. She could turn ordinary water into a medicine that cured diseases. However, there was a serious flaw in this plan—they must not let the rats get near the First Army's campsite. If they knew that someone in the camp could continuously produce "holy medicine," Theo was willing to bet that the news would be all over the city by the next day.



"River water and well water?" she raised her eyebrows, "Are you sure?"

"Don't worry, Your Highness will pay for this," Theo said with a smile.



For the sake of secrecy and safety, he personally had to transport the supplies from the camp to the King's City. If he tried to eliminate the demonic plague by carrying bags of water like he did when treating the refugees from the Eastern Region, it would not only be troublesome but also highly inefficient. He had to find a way to bring in as much purified water as possible in one go.



The huge wine barrels mounted on the four-wheel carriage were obviously a good choice.
