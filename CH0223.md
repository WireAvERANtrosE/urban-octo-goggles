## Premeditation
Tassa had been staying in the inn located in the inner city these past few days, anxiously waiting for a reply from Border Town.

The towering inner city walls divide the capital into two different worlds, with strict controls enforced on those entering and exiting. Nobles and merchants alike were required to undergo a thorough inspection in a small room at the entrance; anyone showing symptoms of illness, such as fever, flushing, or black spots, would not be allowed entry. Once you leave the inner city area, you must return by dusk; otherwise, once the sun sets and the city gates are locked, you'll have to spend the night outside.

Yet even this could not prevent the spread of the demonic plague. Just yesterday, he heard rumors of nobles in the inner city being infected. If not for the Church finally releasing the first batch of Holy Medicine, it's likely the nobles would have collectively evacuated the capital by now.

On the sixth day after sending out his letter, the Margrave Chamber of Commerce finally sent a message. He hurried to the agreed-upon location—a tailor's shop—where he was then led by an attendant into the basement, where the chamber of commerce's owner had long been waiting.

Margrave was seated at a low table with a bowl of ice mint water on it, continuously emitting bursts of chill. Tassa, sweating profusely, sat cross-legged opposite her and immediately felt a cool breeze, which invigorated his spirit.

"Here is the letter His Highness entrusted me to deliver to you." She handed over a folded sheepskin envelope, its wax seal looking intact.

Tassa couldn't wait to open it, pulling out the letter—it briefly outlined the action plan, news of the First Army's departure, and the task he needed to complete. After reading it carefully, he tucked the letter into his chest without betraying any emotion, and looked at Margrave, "Did His Highness make any requests of you?"

"Not at all. He simply entrusted the letter to the messenger—of course, express message delivery comes with a fee, which I've already recorded on the account."

"Cough, I see," Tassa cleared his throat, "His Highness needs to transport all the refugees back to the Western Territory in a very short time. Therefore, he hopes that you can provide a large number of ships for continuous transportation, not just one or two fleets."



"Even if they are infected?" Margie guessed with interest. "I think he certainly does not want to turn the entire Western Region into a wasteland, so... has His Highness found a cure for the demonic plague?"



"Indeed," he nodded, "in fact, the first fleet already had patients aboard, it's just that the outbreak didn't occur until they arrived at the town. Now they are on their way back to the capital, and all the crew are safe and sound."



"Prince Roland really is an incredible person, even the Church hasn't come up with the antidote so quickly," Margie exclaimed in admiration. "So how many days does he plan to use to transport the refugees? A week?"



Tassa held up three fingers.



"This... That's impossible!" The female merchant was stunned for a moment before quickly shaking her head, "Even if half of these people died, there would still be more than five thousand left. To move them all in three days means that I need to prepare nearly a hundred sailboats. Even if the other ships of the Chamber of Commerce stopped and were used for transportation, it would just barely meet this number—but in doing so, the losses I would suffer might be thousands of Gold Royals, and the customers I'd lose are uncountable. Even if the steam engine were free, it wouldn't offset this amount. So... please forgive me for refusing."



"If everyone sits on the deck instead of lying in the cabins with beds, a ship can carry twice the number of people," Tassa insisted, "If comfort isn't an issue, even the two-masted ships used for transporting ore can be used to carry people. Just open the hatches, and you can load about two hundred people at a time. Such ships, your old friend Hogg must have quite a few, right?"



"In Silver City, he indeed has several such large ships..." Margie appeared somewhat hesitant, "And according to your calculations, we could probably reduce the number of ships to about fifty. But... it's not a good deal."



Tassa felt the same way. To gather dozens of ships on the canal, just the coordination and scheduling would take a tremendous amount of effort, and the cost of chartering the ships wouldn't all go into his own pocket. It was a laborious and strenuous task with little reward, definitely not a good deal by any measure. At this point, he could only use his last resort.



At the end of the letter, His Highness wrote a line in small print: If Margie is unwilling to help, tell her that Lightning has also come.



This statement was somewhat baffling—could it be that the female merchant had some special relationship with the lively and adorable blonde girl? They looked nothing alike from their appearances... But His Highness must have his own reasons for saying so. With this thought, Tassa slowly began to speak, "Having to move everything within three days was a last resort. What His Highness is doing is akin to snatching food from the jaws of a tiger. If we delay for too long, the Church is likely to come knocking—especially since Lightning is also in this team. If they discover the existence of a witch, it will be dangerous."



"What did you say?" Her voice suddenly rose, "Lightning is here too?"



"Indeed, His Highness mentioned it in his letter," Tassa put on an honest expression, "Probably to lead the team and provide early warnings. After all, this is the new King Timothy's territory."



"I see," Margaret stood up, "When do you need the ships?"



"They should be needed in four days, if there are no delays on the road."



"I will try my best to arrange that," she walked over to her desk and began writing quickly, "However, I have one condition—you must tell me the location where His Highness's team is stationed. If they want to enter the city, I can also arrange enough rooms."



Well, it seemed that this tactic was indeed effective, "I think that should be no problem," Tassa said with concealed delight, "Besides, I have another matter that requires your assistance."



"Go ahead," Margaret sighed.



"I need a team of carts to haul barrels, the more the better, but don't fill them with ale or wine, use river water or well water instead." According to what was in His Highness's letter, the key figure in dealing with the epidemic was still the witch Lily. She could turn ordinary water into a medicine that cured diseases. However, there was a serious flaw in this plan—they absolutely could not let the rats get close to the First Army's campsite. If they knew that someone in the camp could produce "Holy Medicine" incessantly, Tassa would bet that by the next day, the news would be known throughout the city.



"River water and well water?" She raised her eyebrows. "Are you sure?"

"Don't worry, His Highness will pay for it," Tassa said with a smile.

For the sake of secrecy and safety, only he could transport the goods from the camp to the King's City. If he were to eliminate the demonic plague by carrying bags of water like he did for the refugees from the Eastern Region, not only would it be troublesome, but the efficiency would also be very low. He had to figure out a way to bring in as much purified water as possible all at once.

Mounting huge wine barrels on a four-wheeled carriage was obviously a good choice.
