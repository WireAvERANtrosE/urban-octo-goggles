## Ability
"Your Highness, how high and wide do you plan to build this town wall?" 

"At least fifteen feet high and six feet wide, enough for four people to walk side by side." Roland nodded to himself, appreciating the professionalism; asking for technical specifications first before determining the construction plan was the right approach.



"In that case, it will need a trench one person deep to stabilize the upper part of the wall, and if the top is six feet wide and the wall is fifteen feet high, then the width at the bottom must be at least double," Karl replied promptly. "This means just digging the trench will consume a lot of manpower. Your Highness, if you can give me one hundred and fifty men, I should be able to finish digging this trench before the Evil Months arrive."



"A ditch alone cannot stop the demonic beasts," Roland commented noncommittally.



"That's true, if the upper part of the wall is built with stone, it would take three years. If it's just to stop the demonic beasts, the wall need not be so high; about twelve feet will do, and the width can be reduced by a third, bringing the base down to six feet. If we dig the trench and build the wall at the same time and increase the workforce by two hundred... then I can complete it before the Evil Months next year."



Karl paused, then added, "Please forgive my bluntness, Your Highness, but now is not a good time to start construction. If the wall is not built in time, even if the trench is dug, it will lose its original function after soaking in rain and snow all winter long. Then you'll end up spending more time and manpower clearing the softened trench and deepening the excavation."



"What if, as you said, we build the wall twelve feet high and four feet wide, how long will it take to dig the trench?"



"It should take about a month and a half," Karl answered.



"Then let's go with that plan. Carry out the trenching and construction simultaneously and finish building it before the Evil Months arrive," Roland gestured to interrupt what Karl was about to say, "I know what you're worried about, but first take a look at this, the latest creation from the Greycastle Alchemy Workshop."



He naturally did not have the time to stick a brick again for the stonemason to see, but simply dragged out the two bricks that had been previously glued together for a demonstration. Fortunately, when Prince Roland spoke, almost no one dared to question him. When Karl heard that this alchemical adhesive called cement could transform from a liquid to a solid overnight and generate an extremely high bonding strength, his face showed an incredulous expression of shock.



As someone who had dedicated the first half of his life to the Stonemasons' Guild, he naturally realized how great this invention was. Besides bonding stones, what was more important was that it could be shaped at will. Wasn't this equivalent to having stone constructs of any shape without the need for secondary cutting and polishing? It could eliminate the time-consuming processing stage, and the construction speed of any building would be elevated to a new level. Just this point alone was enough to excite anyone!



Roland watched his expression with satisfaction and asked again, "How about it, do you think three months is enough?"



Karl Barton's voice trembled slightly, "If what you say is correct, no no, I mean... if the description given by the Alchemy Workshop is correct, then I... I am willing to give it a try."



"Very good, I will have someone write a detailed document on how to use the cement for you, and if you have other needs, talk to my minister," Roland said with a smile, "Mr. Karl, now you are a member of the Town Hall."



Nana was met the following afternoon. The little girl looked bewilderedly at Anna, clutching the corner of her garment and barely managing to utter a sentence after a long while, "Am I... dead?"



The first time he saw her, Roland had to admit that the power of the witches not only endowed them with magical abilities but also altered their appearance and temperament to a certain extent. She was completely different from Anna, yet both possessed a unique charm. This feeling was unrelated to age or life circumstance, even when Anna waited in the prison for death, the radiance she exuded was undiminished. Searching through all his memories, whether it was the streetwalkers of Greycastle or the well-bred noble ladies, he had never felt this way before. If he had to describe it, placing them next to the witches was like having color figures appear in a black and white photograph.



The one who had brought her, Karl Barton, tactfully took his leave, leaving only Roland, Anna, and Nana in the palace garden.



"You're not dead, and Anna is alive and well," Roland said, holding back a smile, "I am the Fourth Prince, Roland Wimbledon, and you are—"



"I am Nana Pine," the little girl's expression came back to life upon hearing she hadn't died. She ran straight to Anna's side, chattering away with her, completely disregarding Roland's identity as a prince of Greycastle. Roland naturally wouldn't take offense at a girl of merely fourteen or fifteen years of age. He leaned against the round table, poured himself some barley beer, and appreciated the 'daily life' of the two witches.



Anna was clearly a bit uneasy with the other's familiarity; Nana would say more than a dozen sentences before she would respond once. That being said, Anna was only seventeen herself but already had the air of an older sister. Roland couldn't help but wonder, how outstanding would she become when she grew up?



It wasn't until Nana's pace of speech gradually slowed that he coughed twice and asked, "Miss Pine, I heard from your teacher that you've awakened as a witch?"



Compared to the term 'fallen' into witchcraft that most people used, Roland preferred the term awakening. He wasn't naive enough to think all witches were pure and untainted blank slates; those with malice who gained power would only cause greater destruction. This was like a weapon, which could create violence or resist it—the key lay in whose hands the weapon was held. Perhaps the witch slaughters propagated by the church had factual bases, but it was unfair to use this as evidence of the guilt of the entire group of witches.



Nana's expression stiffened, and she asked in a low voice, "Are you going to hang me?"



"No, of course not. Those who are hanged are unforgivable criminals. You are not, neither is Miss Anna, so you don't need to worry about that."



She took a breath and nodded, "I'm not sure... My teacher said that witches receive their demonic powers after being tempted by the devil, but I've never seen the devil?"



"When did you discover that you were different from others?"



"About a week ago," Nana mumbled, "I saw a little bird that had broken its leg, and I really wanted to help it. Then... I felt something flowing out from my hands."



"Something flowing out?" Roland pressed, "And then what?"



"Um... it suddenly surrounded the little bird, like a glob of sticky water," Nana tilted her head as she recalled, "Then the little bird's leg was healed."



Could her power be of the healing type? Roland's heart thumped wildly; he was acutely aware of what such an ability meant—in an era without antibiotics, without modern medicine, where wounds and infections could easily lead to death, the ability to heal rapidly was akin to having an extra life. This power might not contribute much to the advancement of civilization as a whole, but for individual lives, it was incredibly significant.



He immediately walked to the door and had the knight standing outside fetch a live chicken. If he could prove what she said was true, he might just be able to change the cruel persecution that witches faced in Border Town.
