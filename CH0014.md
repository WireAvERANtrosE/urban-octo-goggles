## Power/Ability
"Your Highness, how high and wide do you plan to make this wall?" 
"At least fifteen feet high and six feet wide to allow four people to walk abreast," Roland nodded to himself. Professionals were different; they always asked for technical parameters first before confirming the construction plan.
"In that case, it will need to dig a trench one man deep to stabilize the upper part of the wall. And if the top is six feet wide and the wall is fifteen feet high, the bottom width must be at least doubled," Karl quickly replied. "With that, just digging the trench will consume a lot of manpower. Your Highness, if you can give me one hundred and fifty men, I should be able to finish digging this trench before the Month of Demons arrives."
"A ditch alone won't stop the demonic beasts," Roland said noncommittally.
"That's true. If the upper part of the wall is built with stone, it would take three years. If it's only for stopping the demonic beasts, the wall doesn't need to be built so high—about twelve feet should suffice, and the width can be reduced by a third, shrinking the base to six feet. If we dig the trench and build the wall simultaneously, and increase the number of workers by two hundred... In this way, I can finish it before the Month of Demons arrives next year."
Karl paused, then continued, "Forgive my bluntness, Your Highness, but now is not a good time to start the work. If the wall is not built in time, even if the trench is dug, after a whole winter of rain and snow soaking, it will lose its original function. Then you would have to spend more time and manpower cleaning the softened trench and deepening the excavation depth again."
"If we do as you say, building the wall twelve feet high and four feet wide, how long will it take to dig the trench?"
"About a month and a half," Karl answered.
"Then let's proceed with that plan, digging the trench and building simultaneously, and have it built before the Month of Demons arrives," Roland waved his hand, cutting off what Karl was about to say, "I know what you're worried about, but first take a look at this, the latest creation from the Greycastle Alchemy Workshop."
He did not have the time to demonstrate sticking bricks together again for the mason, so he simply showed the two blocks that had been previously glued together. Fortunately, when Karl heard that this alchemical adhesive called cement could transform from a liquid to a solid overnight and produce extremely high adhesive strength, his face showed an expression of disbelief.
Having dedicated the first half of his life to the Masons Guild, he naturally realized how great this invention was. Besides bonding stones, what was more important was that it could shape forms at will. Wasn't this the same as having stones of any shape without the need for secondary cutting and polishing? By abandoning the time-consuming processing stage, the construction speed of any building would be taken to a new level. Just this point alone was enough to excite anyone!
Roland watched the man's expression with satisfaction and asked again, "What do you think, is three months enough?"
Karl Barton's voice trembled a bit, "If what you say is true, no, I mean... if the Alchemy Workshop's description of this substance is correct, then... I am willing to give it a try."
"Good. I will have someone write detailed information on how to use cement for you, and if you have any other needs, just talk to my minister assistant," Roland said with a smile, "Mr. Karl, you are now a member of the Administrative Office."
Nana was seen the next afternoon. The little girl looked at Anna somewhat blankly, clutching the corner of her dress for a long time before she managed to say, "Am I... dead?"
The first time he saw her, Roland had to admit that the power of the witches not only gave them magical abilities but also changed their appearance and temperament to some extent. She and Anna were completely different types, yet both contained a unique charm. This feeling was unrelated to age or living conditions; even when Anna was in prison awaiting death, the radiance she emitted was undiminished. Searching through his entire memory, whether it was the street girls of Greycastle or the well-bred noble ladies, he had never felt this way before. If he had to describe it, putting them next to witches was like having colored characters appear in a black and white photo.

Karl Barton tactfully excused himself, leaving only Roland, Anna, and Nana in the palace garden.

"You didn't die, and Anna is doing well," Roland said, holding back a smile. "I am Prince Roland Wimbledon, and you are—"

"I am Nana Pine." The little girl's expression brightened upon hearing she hadn't died. She ran straight to Anna and chattered away, completely disregarding the presence of Prince Roland of Greycastle. Roland, of course, did not mind the young girl's lack of concern for his status. He leaned against the round table, poured himself some barley beer, and enjoyed the 'daily life' of the two witches.

Anna seemed a bit uncomfortable with the other's familiarity, responding only after Nana had spoken a dozen or so sentences. However, considering that Anna was only seventeen, she already had the air of an older sister. Roland couldn't help but wonder how outstanding she would become as she grew older.

It was only when Nana's pace of speech slowed that he coughed twice and asked, "Miss Pine, your teacher mentioned that you've awakened as a witch?"

Compared to what most people referred to as 'falling into darkness,' Roland preferred the term awakening. He was not naïve enough to believe that all witches were pure and untainted; those with malice who gained power would only cause more destruction. It was like a weapon that could be used to create violence or to resist violence; the key was who held the weapon in their hands. Perhaps the witch massacres propagated by the church had factual bases, but it was unfair to take those as evidence of the guilt of the witch community as a whole.

Nana's expression stiffened, and she asked in a low voice, "Are you going to hang me?"

"No, of course not. Those who end up on the gallows are criminals beyond redemption. You are not one, and neither is Miss Anna, so you needn't worry about that."

She took a breath and nodded, "I'm not sure... My teacher said that witches gain their demonic power after being tempted by the devil, but, but I haven't seen any devil?"

"When did you first notice that you were different from others?"

"About a week ago," Nana muttered. "I saw a bird with a broken leg and really wanted to help it. Then... I felt something come out of my hands."

"Something came out?" Roland pressed. "And then?"

"Um... It suddenly surrounded the bird, like a sticky ball of water," Nana tilted her head, recalling the event. "After that, the bird's leg was healed."

Could her power be of the healing type? Roland's heart thumped wildly; he was acutely aware of what such a power meant—in an era without antibiotics and modern medicine, where injuries and infections could easily lead to death, the ability to heal wounds quickly was akin to having an extra life. While such a power might not greatly advance civilization as a whole, it was of incredible significance for individual lives.

He immediately went to the door and instructed the knight standing outside to bring a live chicken. If he could prove what she said was true, he might be able to change the cruel persecution of witches in Border Town.
