## Chase
Lightning zigzagged through the hilly area south of Border Town, filling out the checkered parchment she held in her hands.

This was her most recent task, to work in conjunction with Soraya to draw a map of the Western Territory.

Flying with Soraya meant that they had to significantly decrease their altitude, making it difficult to cross extensive forests. Therefore, Lightning first sketched out rough outlines of the terrain, which Soraya would then piece together to create a complete map. Under the guidance of the Magic Pen, the map looked just as it would from an aerial view, with every detail vividly portrayed.

When the parchment was filled, Lightning turned back towards Border Town. After several months of practice, her flying speed had increased significantly. If she flew at full speed, according to Prince Roland's calculations, she could almost reach a speed of one hundred twenty kilometers per hour. At that velocity, the strong wind made it nearly impossible for her to keep her eyes open.

She had thought that she had reached her limit, but just the day before yesterday, His Highness had presented her with a gift—a headband made of cowhide sewn together with two copper rings, each embedded with a clear, transparent glass. With it on, she could fly unbothered by the wind.

His Highness called it windproof goggles, made on a whim while crafting glassware. He even said that with this, she looked more like Little Ezreal. Lightning didn't know who Ezreal was, but she understood that just combining the cowhide, copper rings, and lenses was a meticulous task. Each piece of leather was double-stitched; the copper rings were tightly wrapped on the inside to prevent any cuts to the skin, and at the back, there was a belt-like buckle for easy adjustment. It didn't seem like something made casually.

She immediately fell in love with the gift and wore it on her head even when sleeping. Now, with the windproof goggles pulled down, she could fly as fast as she wanted without worrying about the howling wind by her ears.

In no time, Lightning arrived above the town and was about to return to the castle to deliver the grid map to Soraya when a white figure suddenly flashed in the corner of her eye. She looked sideways and saw a pigeon spreading its wings and gliding in the direction of Longsong Stronghold. Pigeons were not rare birds, but this one was different; it was exceedingly plump, with wings that could provide a day's worth of nibbling for her.

Lightning swallowed her saliva, recalling the days when she was stranded on a deserted island, catching fish and birds to roast over a campfire. Though the prince's provision of food was plentiful, she had grown tired of buttered bread and mushroom soup after a month. If she could catch a pigeon to roast... She touched the small pouch on her waist that contained salt and pepper, making up her mind.



With a turn, Lightning headed straight for the pigeon, and the latter soon noticed the unwelcome visitor. It folded its wings and dove downwards, seemingly trying to slip into the forest to shake off the ferocious pursuer.



Lightning was slightly taken aback, not expecting the pigeon to be so clever. Then she grinned and swiftly descended, tailing the bird. Ever since she had lured the mixed-breed demonic beasts during the Evil Months, the girl was confident nothing could escape her under her watch.



The pigeon skimmed over the treetops one moment and then flew close to the ground, keeping its altitude extremely low. However, the distance between the two was closing, and no matter how the pigeon flapped its wings, it couldn't shake off Lightning.



The woods quickly receded behind, and sunlight filtered through the dense branches, casting alternating patches of light and shade until they passed through an open area, suddenly becoming spacious and bright. She seized the opportunity, pushing her speed to the limit, and in an instant, she caught the pigeon from behind and pinned it to the ground.



The pigeon struggled in vain to break free from her hold, and Lightning pulled out a small knife from her waist, ready to end the hunt, when the pigeon suddenly spoke, "Don't coo! Save me, coo!"



The little girl shuddered, almost dropping her knife in fright. But she quickly recovered, "You're a witch?"



The pigeon nodded vigorously.



"I thought I could try something different," Lightning sighed in disappointment, putting away her knife. "My name is Lightning. What's yours?"



The other puffed up into a ball, then transformed into a human shape, "Maggie, you actually wanted to eat a bird!" she accused.



"I've eaten quite a lot before," Lightning shrugged and reached out to pull her up. Suddenly, a bead rolled out from her bosom, bounced twice on the ground, and fell into a small pit. Lightning walked over to pick up the bead, and was about to return it to Maggie when she noticed a series of strange runes engraved on this transparent red bead, similar to glass, which looked very familiar.



She frowned and pondered for a while, then hooked the thin rope around her neck and pulled out a deep red pendant from her chest. Comparing the two in her hand, she realized that the runes on them were exactly the same.



"Huh?" Maggie poked her head out from behind, "You have a tracking sigil too?"



"A tracking sigil... What's that?"



"You don't know? This thing can be sensed by magic stones, and it can locate the holder's position." She paused, "Wait, why should I tell you? You just wanted to eat me a moment ago."



"Do you have a magic stone?"



"I have—no." Maggie shook her head.



"So you can locate my position?" Lightning asked curiously.



"Nope, it must be a matching magic stone to locate the corresponding sigil," she answered quite briskly this time, "And only witches can use it. You don't know anything, how did you get it?"



"My dad gave it to me when I was little," Lightning returned the bead to the other party, "What about yours?"



"I won't tell you," Maggie made a face, then looked at the former curiously, "So you're the witch from the Witch Union? Ashes said that you guys don't want to leave Border Town."



"Are you one of her people?" Lightning pouted, "I thought you were a newcomer drawn here by the rumors. Everyone's doing well here, why should we leave?"



"Because it's dangerous, the Church could lead an army here at any time."



"An explorer doesn't shy away from danger," Lightning’s face turned slightly red, um... except for that time going to the stone tower. The next time she would go to the ruins, she had to be the first to step into the basement, "Besides, Prince Roland has many incredible inventions, once you see them, you'll definitely be attracted. One of them is a weapon that fires iron balls the size of a fist, anyone hit by it would be torn to shreds."



"Really? Can you take me to see it?" Maggie exclaimed.



"That won’t do, unless you join the Witch Union and become one of us."



"But I have to take Ashes back..." She hesitated.



"Then you can come back after you're done with that," Lightning tempted, "There are so many fun things here; there's a machine that moves on its own just by boiling water, weapons that can attack the enemy from kilometers away, uh... how far is a kilometer? Anyway, it's very far, people look only the size of tree branches." She gestured with her hands and feet, "And there are even more places to play in the Misty Forest, like poking beehives, picking mushrooms—that's nothing, hunting birds and wild boars is interesting. Skinning and roasting them over a campfire until they're shiny with oil, then sprinkled with salt and pepper, it tastes all meaty and delicious when you eat it."



"Really?" Maggie couldn't help but lick her lips.



"Why would I lie to you," Lightning hooked her arm around the other's shoulder, "How about we go hunt a bird right now and roast it to eat!"
