## Chase
Lightning darted through the hills to the south of Border Town, filling in the squares on the parchment in her hand one by one.

This was her latest assignment, to work with Soraya to map the Western Region.

Flying with Soraya would greatly reduce their altitude, making it difficult to fly over vast stretches of forest. Therefore, Lightning would first sketch out the rough outlines, which Soraya would then piece together to create a complete map. Under the power of the Magic Pen, the map looked just like it was seen from above, every detail vivid and lifelike.

Once the parchment was filled, Lightning turned back towards Border Town. With the practice of these past months, her flying speed had increased more and more; at full speed, she could almost reach one hundred and twenty kilometers per hour, according to Prince Roland's calculations. At this speed, the strong wind blowing in her face nearly made it impossible to keep her eyes open.

She thought this was the limit she could reach, but the day before yesterday, His Highness gave her a gift—a leather headband stitched together with two copper rings, each ring fitted with a pane of pure, transparent glass. With it on, she could fly free from the trouble of the wind.

His Highness called it "windproof goggles," made on a whim while crafting glassware. He also said that with these, she looked even more like little Ezreal. Lightning didn't know who Ezreal was, but she understood that just combining leather, copper rings, and lenses was a rather laborious task. Each piece of leather was double-stitched, the inside of the copper rings was securely wrapped to prevent any cuts, and there was an adjustable buckle like those on a belt at the back, allowing the tightness to be easily altered. It did not look like something hastily made in any respect.

She immediately fell in love with the gift and almost slept with it on her head. Now, just by pulling down the windproof goggles, she could fly as fast as she wanted without worrying about the howling wind by her ears.

Before long, Lightning arrived above the town, intending to return to the castle to hand over the grid map to Soraya, when a white figure suddenly flashed from the corner of her eye. Turning her head, she saw a pigeon spreading its wings and gliding towards Longsong Stronghold. Pigeons were not rare birds, but this one was different; it was so plump that its wings alone would be enough for her to gnaw on for a day.

Lightning swallowed, remembering the days she had caught fish and birds with her own hands and roasted them over a campfire when she was stranded on the desert island. The meals provided by Prince Roland were also plentiful, but after a month of buttered bread and mushroom soup, she was starting to tire of it. If she could catch a pigeon to roast... She felt the small pouch on her waist containing salt and pepper, and made up her mind.



With a turn, Lightning charged straight at the pigeon which quickly became aware of the uninvited guest. It folded its wings and dove downwards, seemingly trying to dive into the forest to shake off the ferocious pursuer.



Lightning was slightly startled, not expecting the pigeon to be so clever. She then smirked and dove sharply, following it closely. Ever since luring the mixed breed demonic beasts during the Evil Months, the young girl was confident that nothing could escape under her watch.



The pigeon skimmed over the treetops one moment and flew close to the ground the next, but the distance between them shortened more and more. No matter how hard it flapped its wings, it couldn't shake off Lightning.



The forest rapidly receded behind them, sunlight filtered through the dense branches, patches of light and shadow alternating, until they crossed an open area and the surroundings became suddenly spacious and bright. She seized the opportunity to push her speed to the limit and instantly grabbed the pigeon from behind, pinning it to the ground.



The pigeon struggled in vain to break free from her grasp. Lightning pulled out a small knife from her waist, ready to finish off her prey, when suddenly the pigeon spoke, "Don't coo! Save me coo!"



The young girl shuddered in fright, almost dropping her knife. However, she quickly recovered her senses, "Are you a witch?"



The pigeon nodded repeatedly.



"I thought I could have a different taste," Lightning sighed with disappointment, withdrawing her knife. "My name's Lightning, what's yours?"



The pigeon puffed up and then transformed into a human shape, "Maggie, you actually wanted to eat a bird!" she accused.



"I've eaten quite a few before," Lightning shrugged and reached out to pull her up. Suddenly, a bead rolled out of her bosom, bounced twice on the ground, and fell into a small dirt pit. Lightning went over to pick up the bead and was about to return it to Maggie when she noticed that the transparent, glass-like red bead was engraved with a string of peculiar runes that looked very familiar.



She frowned and thought for a moment, then hooked her finger around the thin cord on her neck and pulled out a dark red pendant from her chest. Holding them together in her hand, she realized that the runes on them were exactly the same.



"Huh?" Maggie popped her head out from behind, "Do you also have a tracking sigil?"



"A tracking sigil... What is that?"



"You don't know? This thing can be sensed by magic stones, and it can locate the position of the holder." She paused, "Wait, why should I tell you? You just tried to eat me."



"Do you have a magic stone?"



"I have—no," Maggie shook her head.



"So you can locate my position?" Lightning asked curiously.



"No, you need the matching magic stone to locate the corresponding sigil." This time she answered quite briskly, "And only a witch can use it. How did you get it if you know nothing about it?"



"It was given to me by my dad when I was a child," Lightning returned the bead to the other party, "What about yours?"



"I'm not telling you," Maggie made a face, then looked curiously at the former, "So you're a witch from the Witch Union? Ashes told me that you don't want to leave Border Town."



"Are you with her?" Lightning pouted, "I thought you were a newcomer attracted by the rumors. Everyone's having a good time here, so why leave?"



"Because it's dangerous, the Church could send troops at any moment."



"An explorer doesn't flinch at danger," Lightning's face reddened slightly—hmm... except for that time at the stone tower. Next time she went to the ruins, she would be the first to step into the basement, "And Prince Roland has many incredible inventions. Once you see them, you'll be fascinated. One of them is a weapon that fires iron balls the size of fists. Anyone it hits gets torn to shreds."



"Really? Can you take me to see them?" Maggie exclaimed.



"That's not possible unless you join the Witch Union and become one of us."



"But I have to take Ashes back..."



"You can always come back after you've done that," Lightning tempted, "There are so many fun things here, like machines that move on their own just by boiling water, weapons that can attack enemies miles away—uh... how far is a mile? Anyway, it's very far, people look only the size of tree branches." She gesticulated with her hands and feet, "And there are even more places to play in the Misty Forest, like poking beehives, picking mushrooms—that's nothing—hunting birds and wild boars is fun. Skinning them and roasting them on a bonfire until they're shiny with oil, then sprinkling them with salt and pepper, makes for a mouthful of delicious meat."



"Really?" Maggie couldn't help but lick her lips.

"Why would I lie to you," Lightning hooked her arm around the other's shoulder, "How about we go hunt a bird right now and roast it to eat!"
