## Transmutation Ceremony
The God's Punishment Army transformation ceremony is a piece of knowledge that the Pope must master. A year ago, when Mayne took over the God's Punishment Army scriptures from Archbishop O'Brien, it was tantamount to obtaining the qualification to succeed as the next Pope.

Mayne had long since memorized the contents of the book by heart. To create a member of the God's Punishment Army, the life of a witch must be sacrificed, her blood merged with the God's Punishment Stone, and then infused into the body of the Judgement Army. This ritual had been improved several times over the course of hundreds of years, but its essence remained unchanged—the number of witches determined the upper limit of the God's Punishment Army, and the will of the Judgement Army was the key to the success rate of the transformation.

After finishing the scriptures, he understood why the church took in so many underage girls every year. Witches showed no signs before the accumulation of magic power; they were no different from ordinary people. But once the magic began to gather, their bodies, organs, and blood would change. So, apart from expanding the breeding scale, there was no other way.

This was also why he agreed with Heather's statement—they had already committed utmost evil, every high-ranking official's hands were stained with blood, and they had slaughtered more witches than any executioner. But to defeat the devils, to prevent the annihilation of mankind, they had to keep doing this.

Only the victor deserves God's favor.

...

Two members of the Judgement Army lay on the transformation platform—Mayne recognized them, they were respectively Delian from the Vanguard Camp and Tucker Thor from the Holy City's Guard, the latter being a Chief Judge.

Although both men wore smiles, the bishop could still see the tension in their taut muscles and clenched fists. He patted their shoulders, "Relax, I believe you can do it."

"Your Grace, when the time comes, do we just need to endure the pain?" Delian couldn't help asking.



"Indeed, just hang in there," Mayne smiled. "Your name is Daly, right?"



"You actually remember my name," he said excitedly.



"Of course, you're a member of the Vanguard, and you participated in last year's defense against the demonic beasts at Hermes," Mayne said. "The captain was... Alethea, right?"



"Yes, yes," Daly nodded again and again. "Our team suffered heavy casualties in a battle, half of the team members died at the hands of the mixed-breeds, and I thought to myself that if I had the power to annihilate those deformed hybrids, that would be great. So, my lord, I want to become a God's Punishment Army soldier!"



"To become stronger to protect your comrades-in-arms is a good conviction," Mayne encouraged him, then he looked at the presiding judge, "And you? Tuck Thore, what made you decide to become a God's Punishment Army soldier?"



"To defend the New Holy City, my lord," he said firmly. "The priests said that the demonic beasts will grow stronger every year, and last time they already reached the walls of the Holy City. If not for the God's Punishment Army, the Grand Cathedral might have been destroyed. I also want to become the stout shield against the demonic beasts and the piercing spear through the enemy."



"Very good, you both are the pride of the Church." Mayne followed the steps outlined in the scriptures to ease their tension and fear with conversation, and seeing their emotions gradually become more elevated, he waved his hand, signaling for the ritual to continue.



The guards came forward and blindfolded the two men, securing their limbs firmly to the transformation platform with wrist and ankle cuffs. Then the witch was brought in, laid flat between them.



As a witch raised by the Church, she had spent most of her life in the Old Holy City Monastery, and after her awakening, she would be sent to the Secret Area, waiting to be used as material for transformation. The day before the sacrifice, she had been fed a large amount of Dream Water—a concoction made from Sleepy Fern and Winter Blossom, ensuring that no sound during the ritual would wake her.



"Number, age?"

"Number one, eighteen years old." The guard answered.

This was a routine inquiry, as only the blood of an adult witch was sufficient to meet the needs of transforming two God's Punishment Army soldiers at the same time. After confirming the witch's information against the register, Mayne announced the start of the ceremony.

A delicate silver syringe was inserted into the witch's arm, her russet blood flowing through the tubing wrapped around the needle, converging into the crystal basin beneath her. The bottom of the basin was lined with a layer of light blue God's Stones of Retribution, and the blood gradually submerged the stones until the basin was completely filled.

Soon, the God's Stones of Retribution underwent a change. Through the side of the basin, it was observable how the blue stones were absorbing the blood. After about a quarter of an hour, the stones gradually melted away, the turbid blood turning clear and changing from russet to sky blue in color.

These operations seemed simple, but they were the result of tens of thousands of trials, leading to a set of complete and reliable steps. Factors such as the estimated blood volume of witches of different ages and body types, the manufacture of the silver needle and tubing, where to extract blood from the body, where to transfuse it, as well as the selection of the quality and quantity of the God's Stones of Retribution... The books detailed records of failed experiments and improvements and also expounded the general principle of conversion.

After the witch's body was transformed by magic, her blood carried the ability to enhance organs and tendons. If used directly, it would instantly kill the recipient. It was necessary to soak the God's Stones of Retribution in the witch's blood to neutralize the 'as yet unclear power,' before it could be infused into the transferee's body—even so, this blood would damage a person's mind, causing them to gradually lose emotions and intelligence, leaving only instinct and some strong will. The surviving members of the God's Punishment Army were enhanced to a level comparable to that of the Extraordinaries, and they also possessed an anti-magic effect even when not wearing the God's Stones of Retribution.

It must be said that this was a miraculous combination: the blood of a witch could kill a human, swallowing the God's Stones of Retribution would also be lethal, but when combined, they could reduce these adverse effects to a minimum.

When the blue liquid slowly flowed into the bodies of the two Judgement Army soldiers through the tubing, the veins in their arms and necks suddenly bulged, their expressions twisted as if enduring great pain. Delian was the first to cry out; he struggled on the platform, clenching and opening his fingers, though his limbs were immobile, and soon his entire body broke out in a fine sweat.



Tucker was not faring any better. He let out a series of low growls, blood foam dribbling from the corners of his mouth, his whole body convulsing.



The liquid in the crystal basin slowly receded, and as it was about to run dry, Daly's voice had turned into a sob. He blabbered incoherently, his skin cracking and dissolving, white smoke rising from his entire body. Judging from the descriptions in the scriptures, his transformation was on the verge of failure. As Mayne hesitated whether to continue observing, the Pope placed his hand on his shoulder from behind and said, "Enough, grant him release."



A guard stepped forward, drew a short sword, and stabbed it cleanly and decisively into Daly's neck, then twisted the hilt violently, putting an end to his agony.



After an agonizing wait, Tucker's convulsions subsided, his breathing gradually steadied, and his skin shifted from rosy to a pale blue. Mayne knew that he had survived the transformation ritual.



One success, one failure, such an outcome made him sigh. In a mere quarter of an hour, the Church had lost a devout member of the Judgement Army and wasted half of the witch's blood.



However, there were still sixty members of the Judgement Army waiting for transformation, and he had to ensure the ritual continued.



...



By the time the ritual was completed, Mayne could barely stand. He staggered down from the platform and slumped against the wall of the hall, nearly losing his composure.



The Pope slowly made his way over and stood before him, "Honestly, your performance surprised me, child. The first time I presided over the ritual, I did much worse than you. I was forty-five that year, and the strong stench of blood caused me to vomit directly on the platform, nearly wasting an entire basin of blood. The former Pope even gave me a severe thrashing, but after the beating, he ordered me to get back on the platform and continue presiding over the ritual."



"..." Mayne opened his mouth but did not know what to say.

"So, don't think about anything, just go back and rest for a day."

"Yes, Your Highness." The bishop took a deep breath, knelt down to pay his respects, and was about to take his leave when he suddenly remembered the purpose of his visit, "Right, you called me to the Secret Area because..."

"Ah, look at my memory," Oberlin mocked himself with a shake of his head, "I wanted to give you a new poison developed by the mechanism research."

"Poison?" There was an institution within the mechanism Secret Area dedicated to researching the God's Punishment Stones, such as the Cold-drivings, Luminescent Stones, Berserker Drugs, etc., which would then be distributed for bishops to use. But Mayne had never heard that they were also involved with poison, which, in his impression, should be the domain of alchemists.

"They say this result came about entirely by chance," the Pope said slowly. "It only needs to be sprinkled on rotting corpses to be effective on the surrounding population for a long time, without the need to be ingested like ordinary poisons. Without a special antidote, it's basically incurable. You can ask Master Crow Eye for the specifics, but I think it might come in handy in the battle against the four major kingdoms."

Mayne immediately thought of the Fortress of Fallen Teeth, which had been under siege for a long time, and the unpleasant stalemate with Greycastle. He suppressed his joy and paid his respects again, "If this poison is as effective as Master Crow Eye says, then it would indeed be a great help to me."
