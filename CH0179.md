## Transmutation Ceremony
The God's Punishment Army transformation ceremony is knowledge the Pope must master. A year ago, when Mayne received the God's Punishment Army scriptures from Archbishop O'Brien, it was tantamount to obtaining the qualifications to succeed the next Pope.



Mayne had long since memorized the content of the book. A God's Punishment Army soldier required the sacrifice of a witch's life, fusing her blood with the Divine Stone of Judgement, and then injecting it into the body of the God's Punishment Army soldier. This set of rituals had been improved several times over hundreds of years of use, but the essence remained unchanged—the number of witches determined the upper limit of the God's Punishment Army, and the will of the God's Punishment Army was the key to the success rate of the transformation.



After reading this book, he understood why the Church took in so many underage girls every year. The appearance of witches was without warning; before the gathering of magical power, they were indistinguishable from normal people. Once the magical power began to converge, their bodies, organs, and blood would be transformed. Therefore, apart from expanding the scale of breeding, there was no other way.



This was also the reason he agreed with Hester's statement—they were already committing extreme evil, every high-ranking official's hands were stained with blood, they had slaughtered more witches than any executioner. But to defeat the devil, to avoid the annihilation of mankind, they had to continue.



Only the victor was entitled to God's favor.



...



Two God's Punishment Army soldiers lay on the transformation platform, Mayne recognized them, they were respectively Delian from the vanguard camp and Tucker Thor from the Holy City's Judgement Army, the latter being a High Judge.



Although both men were smiling, the Bishop could still see the tension from their tight muscles and clenched fists. He patted them on the shoulders, "Relax, I believe you can do it."



"My Lord, when the time comes, do we just need to endure the pain?" Delian couldn't help but ask.



"That's right, just hang in there," Mayne smiled. "Your name is Dalyen, isn't it?"

"You actually remember my name," he said excitedly.

"Of course, you're a member of the vanguard camp, and you took part in last year's defense of Hermes, and your captain was... Alethea, am I right?"

"Yes, yes," Dalyen nodded repeatedly, "Our team suffered heavy casualties in one battle, half of the team members died at the hands of the mixed-breed demonic beasts. At that time, I thought to myself, if only I had the power to wipe out those abnormal breeds. So, my lord, I want to become a God's Punishment Army soldier!"

"To become stronger in order to protect your comrades, that's a good belief," Mayne encouraged. Then he looked towards the presiding judge, "And you? Tadak Thor, what about you? Why have you decided to become a God's Punishment Army soldier?"

"To defend the New Holy City, my lord," he said firmly, "The priests say that the demonic beasts will get stronger every year, and last time they already reached the walls of the Holy City. If it weren't for the God's Punishment Army, the great cathedral might already have been destroyed. I also want to become the steadfast shield against the demonic beasts, the long spear that pierces through our enemies."

"Very good, you are both the pride of the church." Mayne followed the steps detailed in the scriptures, using conversation to alleviate their nervousness and fear. Seeing that their mood gradually became uplifted, he waved his hand to signal for the ceremony to continue.

The guards came forward to blindfold the two men and used shackles and bonds to securely fix their limbs to the transformation platform. Then the witch was carried in, laid flat between the two of them.

As a witch bred by the church, she had spent most of her life in the old Holy City's monastery. After her awakening, she would be sent to the secret area to await transformation as a material. On the day before the sacrifice, she was filled with a large amount of dreamwater—a potion made from sleep fern and winterflower, ensuring that no noise during the ceremony would awaken her.



"Number, age?"

"Number one, eighteen years old," the guard replied.

This was a routine inquiry; only the blood of adult witches was sufficient to fulfill the needs of transforming two God's Punishment Army soldiers at once. After Main checked the witch registry again to confirm there were no mistakes, he declared the ceremony to begin.

A delicate silver needle tube was inserted into the witch's arm, and her reddish-brown blood flowed along the leather tube attached to the silver needle, gathering into the crystal basin beneath her. The bottom of the basin was covered with a layer of light blue Divine Stone of Judgement, and as the blood gradually submerged the stones, it eventually filled the entire basin.

Soon, the Divine Stone of Judgement began to change. Through the side of the basin, it was visible that the blue stones were absorbing the blood. After about a quarter of an hour, the stones gradually melted away, and the murky blood became clear and transparent, its color changing from reddish-brown to sky blue.

These procedures seemed simple, but they had been refined through tens of thousands of trials to develop a complete and reliable method. For instance, the estimation of blood volume based on the different ages and body sizes of witches, the making of silver needles and leather tubes, determining which part of the body to draw blood from and which part to transfuse into, as well as the selection of the quality and quantity of the Divine Stone of Judgement... The books detailed numerous failed experiments and improvements as well as a rough explanation of the principle behind the transformation.

After a witch's body was transformed by magic, her blood carried the ability to enhance organs and tendons. If used directly, it would instantly kill the recipient. The Divine Stone of Judgement had to be soaked in the witch's blood to neutralize the "unidentified powers" before being transfused into the transformer—even so, this kind of blood would damage a person's psyche, causing them to gradually lose emotions and intelligence, leaving only instinct and some strong will. The surviving members of the God's Punishment Army were enhanced to the level of extraordinary beings and could have an antimagic effect even without wearing the Divine Stone of Judgement.

It had to be said, this was a peculiar combination—the blood of a witch could kill a human, and swallowing the Divine Stone of Judgement could also be lethal, yet when combined, they could reduce these adverse effects to a minimum.

As the blue liquid slowly flowed into the two members of the Judgement Army through the leather tube, the veins on their arms and necks bulged out violently, their expressions contorted as if enduring immense pain. Dailen was the first to cry out; he struggled on the platform, clenching and unclenching his fists, his limbs immobile, and soon, a layer of fine sweat appeared all over his body.



Tucker didn't fare much better; he let out a series of low growls, with trickles of blood foaming at the corner of his mouth, his entire body convulsing.

As the liquid in the crystal basin slowly receded, nearing the bottom, Daly’s voice turned into a wailing cry. He shouted incoherently, his skin cracked and dissolved, and white smoke rose from his body. Judging by the descriptions in the archives, his transformation was on the verge of failure. Maine hesitated over whether to continue observing when the Pope placed a hand on his shoulder from behind, "Enough, grant him release."

A guard stepped forward, drew a short sword, and plunged it cleanly into Daly’s neck, twisting the hilt violently, putting an end to his suffering.

After an agonizing wait, Tucker Thorne's convulsions subsided. His breathing gradually steadied, and his skin turned from rosy to a pale blue. Maine knew he had survived the transformation ceremony.

One success, one failure; such outcomes made him sigh. In just a short quarter of an hour, the Church had lost a devoted member of the Judgement Army and wasted half of the Witch's blood.

However, there were still sixty members of the Judgement Army waiting to be transformed, so he had to let the ceremony continue.

...

When the ceremony was finally over, Maine could barely stand. He staggered down from the platform and slumped against the wall of the great hall, nearly losing all decorum.

The Pope slowly made his way over and stood before him, "To be honest, your performance surprised me, child. I fared much worse the first time I presided over the ceremony. I was exactly forty-five years old that year, and the intense stench of blood made me vomit directly on the platform, nearly wasting an entire basin of blood. The former Pope even gave me a harsh whipping, but after that, he ordered me back to the platform to continue presiding over the ceremony."



"..." Mayne opened his mouth but did not know what to say.

"So don't think about anything, just go back and rest for a day."

"Yes, Your Grace." The bishop took a deep breath, knelt down to bid farewell, and when he was about to leave, he suddenly remembered the purpose of his visit, "Right, you called me to the Secret Area for..."

"Ah, look at my memory," O'Brien said self-deprecatingly as he shook his head, "I summoned you here to entrust you with a new poison developed by our mechanism research."

"Poison?" The Secret Area had specialized institutions researching the Divine Stone of Judgement, producing items like the cold-dispelling pills, luminescent stones, and frenzy potions, which would be distributed to bishops once they had results. But Mayne had never heard that they were involved in poison as well. In his understanding, that was supposed to be the domain of alchemists.

"They say that this result came about entirely by chance," the Pope said slowly. "It only needs to be sprinkled on rotting corpses to be effective for a long period of time on the surrounding population, without the need to be ingested like common poisons. Without a specific antidote, it is basically incurable. You can ask Master Eye of the Crow for the details. I think it might be useful in the battle against the four major kingdoms."

Mayne immediately thought of the long-impregnable Fort of Broken Tooth and the unpleasant stalemate with Greycastle. Suppressing his joy, he bowed again and said, "If this poison is as effective as Master Eye of the Crow claims, then it could indeed be of great help to me."
