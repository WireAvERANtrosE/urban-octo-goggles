## Negotiations (Part 2)
The sound of rain outside the window had almost ceased, and the clouds were dyed red by the setting sun.

Roland pushed open the door to the guest room on the first floor, where Margaret was pacing back and forth in front of the fireplace, looking quite anxious. Shawn, the personal guard standing by, saluted and left upon seeing the prince, while she quickly came forward and asked eagerly, "Your Highness, how is Lightning?"

Roland was taken aback. He had anticipated all kinds of reactions from her, ranging from calmness to anger to indifference, but he hadn't expected her first question to be this.

"She's fine... just tired."

"Is that so? That's good." She seemed to breathe a sigh of relief.

"You seem to care a lot about her."

"She looks so much like her father, especially those narrow eyes and the sharp nose... I can tell, she's the daughter of Thunder."

After speaking, she sighed, unbuttoned her collar, bowed her head, and took off a string of golden ornaments hanging around her neck, "The verification you spoke of before... it's about using the abilities of a witch to judge, right? If doing so can prove my sincerity, could you also include her in this conversation? I don't like the feeling of being spied on in secret."

The ornament consisted of a chain of gold and a huge pale blue gemstone—a hexahedron-cut jewel that must be a high-quality Divine Stone of Judgement.



Roland was contemplating how to start the conversation in a way that would minimize the other party's displeasure and suspicion, but to his surprise, she took the initiative to do so. Honestly, he was somewhat impressed by this woman from the Fjords; despite being in an extremely unfavorable situation, she was still trying to take control of the conversation. Both her negotiation skills and demeanor matched that of a successful businessperson.



He took the Divine Stone of Judgement she handed over and hung it on the coat rack by the fireplace—such a quality Divine Stone of Judgement probably had a magic suppression range of about one meter, in Nightingale's eyes, it might as well have been a huge black hole. Perhaps to avoid the effects of the stone, she had already hidden herself far away.



"Let's talk in the drawing room," Roland said. Since the other party had shown sincerity, he should not be too petty. When the two entered the drawing room, Nightingale had already revealed herself and was sitting next to the main seat, supporting her chin with both hands, deliberately putting on a look as if she had been waiting for a long time—It seems she thought the same as him, the prince mused.



After sitting down, he introduced her first: "This lady is Nightingale. She can judge the truth of what you say."



"Hello, Miss Nightingale," Margaret nodded to her, and the latter returned the gesture.



"You said earlier that you bear no ill will towards witches, why is that?" Roland asked the first question, which was also the one he most wanted to know, "As far as I'm aware, the Church also has a presence in the Fjords."



"But its influence is far less than that of the Three Gods, or rather, the faith of most Fjords people is similar to that of the Sand People, worshipping the sky, the ocean, and the earth. As for me..." she paused, "I once had a very close companion. During a fishing trip at sea, we encountered a storm, and our sailboat was broken in half by a huge wave. She became a witch in this disaster, able to breathe like a fish. She found me unconscious and dragged me ashore."



"What happened afterward?" Nightingale asked curiously.



"After I woke up, she had left... Perhaps she longed to be in the sea more than staying with me," Margaret said regretfully, "I never saw her again after that. People in the village often say that she appears when a fog rises on the sea, using her singing voice to guide fishing boats away from the rocks. Regardless, my companion could never be an evildoer, much less a pawn of the devil."



Roland nodded. Witches all awakened from ordinary people, so if one had deep contact or understanding with them before their awakening, the impression formed would be difficult for the Church's unilateral argument to change.

"You seem to have a good understanding of the witches' abilities? You guessed that there might be more than one witch hiding here with just one sentence."

"To be honest, because of childhood friends, I have been interested in witches and have thought about sheltering these extraordinary women," Margaret smiled. "Unfortunately, the capital is not like Border Town, and in the end, I gave up due to the high risk. Lightning's behavior seems very close to you, and given her identity as a witch... So, I thought maybe you are like me and do not loathe witches. As a lord, it's not difficult to hide a few witches, especially in this remote place. But you still need to be very careful, if the Church finds out, it will be hard to protect them."

At this point, Nightingale had not detected any sign of lying from the other party, which essentially ruled out the possibility of her informing the Church. Roland finally let go of his worries and said with a slight apology, "It seems I was indeed overthinking, I hope you don't take it to heart."

"No, Your Highness, your actions are for the safety of Lightning and... this lady," Margaret waved her hand, "If you were indifferent, that would be irresponsible."

"Are you close with Thunder?" Roland inquired. "Your care for Lightning truly goes beyond the ordinary concern for a hero's children."

Faced with this question, Margaret hesitated for a moment. Roland indicated that she did not have to answer if she did not wish to, but she finally began to speak slowly, "To be honest with you, after leaving the fishing village, I joined Lord Thunder's exploration team and shared a long period of exploration with him. As a newcomer to the team, Lord Thunder and his wife took extra care of me, and I was also present on the day Lightning was born."

"She was born on a ship?"

"Yes, during a fierce storm. The thunder and lightning outside the cabin never stopped. Shortly after she was born, Lord Thunder's wife passed away due to septicemia, and I... took on the role of her half-mother. Without breast milk, I would mash up wheat porridge and fish roe powder together, feeding her little by little." Margaret's voice became very gentle, "Although Lord Thunder was overwhelmed with grief, he still had to command the fleet to move forward—if the mainstay was lost, the crew could easily collapse during the months-long voyage. And I stayed in the cabin, watching Lightning grow up slowly. It wasn't until Lord Thunder discovered the Shadow Islands and successfully returned to Sea Dragon Bay that the adventure ended. After that, I... left the Fjords and settled down in the capital of Greycastle."



"So that's how it is." Roland sighed inwardly. It was no wonder that she had such a strong reaction when she heard the name Thunder. As for why she didn't continue to follow Thunder on his adventures, he could roughly guess the reason. Having the beginning of a love story doesn't necessarily mean you'll get the ending of one.



This really is a twist of fate... Now that we have this connection, could it be that I can get a bigger discount in our dealings? He coughed twice, "Miss Margaret, now that we know each other, about our deal—"



"Your Highness, that won't do," Margaret said with a smile, "Business is business, and that is a merchant's unchanging principle."
