## Negotiations (Part 2)
The rain outside the window had basically ceased, and the clouds were dyed red by the setting sun. 

Roland pushed open the door to the first floor guest room, where Margaret was pacing back and forth in front of the fireplace, looking rather anxious. The personal guard, Shawn, saluted and left upon seeing the prince, while she quickly approached and asked eagerly, "Your Highness, how is Lightning?"



Roland paused, having anticipated all sorts of reactions from her—from calm to angry to indifferent—but he had not expected her first question to be this. 

"She's fine... just tired." 

"Is that so? That's good," she said, looking as if a weight had been lifted off her shoulders. 

"You seem to care about her quite a lot." 

"She looks so much like her father, especially those narrow eyes and pointed nose... I can tell, she is Thunder's daughter." 



After saying this, she sighed, unbuttoned her collar, lowered her head, and took off a string of golden ornaments hanging around her neck, "The verification you spoke of before... it refers to using the witches' abilities to judge, right? If doing so can prove my sincerity, may she also be included in this conversation? I don't like the feeling of being spied on in secret."



The ornament was made up of a string of gold chains and a huge light blue gemstone — the jewel cut into a hexahedron must be the high-quality God's Punishment Stone.



Roland was pondering how to start the conversation in a way that could reduce the other party's antipathy and suspicion, but to his surprise, she took the initiative to do so. Frankly speaking, he was somewhat impressed by this lady from the Fjords. Despite being in a very disadvantageous situation, she was still trying to take the initiative in the conversation. Both her negotiation skills and her demeanor fit the identity of a successful merchant.



He received the God's Punishment Stone from her and hung it on the coat rack by the fireplace—this quality of God's Punishment Stone probably had a magic-nullifying range of about one meter, in Nightingale's eyes, it was comparable to a huge black hole. Perhaps to avoid the effect of the stone, she had already hidden herself far away.



"Let's go to the parlor and talk," Roland said. Since the other party had shown sincerity, he should not be too petty. When the two entered the parlor, Nightingale had already revealed herself and was sitting beside the main seat, her hands propping up her chin, deliberately putting on a look as if she had been waiting for a long time—It seems her thoughts are the same as mine, the prince thought.



After sitting down, he took the lead to introduce, "This lady is Nightingale. She can judge whether you are telling the truth or not."



"Hello, Miss Nightingale," Margaret nodded to her, to which the latter returned the gesture.



"You said before that you have no ill will towards witches, why?" Roland posed the first question, which was also the one he most wanted to know. "As far as I know, the Church also has influence in the Fjords."



"But its influence is far less than that of the Three Gods, or to say, the faith of most Fjord people is similar to that of the Sand People, worshiping the sky, the sea, and the earth. As for me..." she paused, "I once had a very good partner. During a fishing trip out to sea, we encountered a storm, and our sailboat was broken in half by the giant waves. She became a witch in this disaster, able to breathe like a fish. She found me unconscious and dragged me to shore."



"What happened after?" Nightingale asked curiously.



"After I woke up, she had left... perhaps she longed to be in the vast sea more than staying with me," Margaret said with regret, "I never saw her again after that. The people in the village often say that she appears when the sea fog rises, using her singing to guide the fishing boats away from the rocks. No matter what, my partner could never be a minion of evil, much less the devil's claw."



Roland nodded. Witches were awakened from ordinary people, and if one had profound contact or understanding before their awakening, it was difficult for the Church's unilateral statements to change that impression.



"You seem to know quite a bit about the abilities of witches? You guessed that there might be more than one witch hiding here just from a single sentence."



"To be honest, due to my childhood companions, I have been very interested in witches and even thought about taking in these unique women," Margaret smiled. "Unfortunately, the capital is not like Border Town, and I ultimately gave up because the risk was too great. Lightning's behavior seems very close to you, and given her identity as a witch... So, I thought maybe you, like me, do not detest witches. As a lord, hiding several witches is not a difficult task, especially in this remote place. But you must still be very careful, if the Church discovers them, it will be difficult to protect them."



At this point, Nightingale had not yet detected any signs of lying from her, which basically ruled out the possibility of her informing the Church. Roland finally relaxed and said with a slight apology, "It seems I was indeed overly cautious, I hope you don't take it to heart."



"No, Your Highness, your actions were for the safety of Lightning and... this lady," Margaret waved her hand, "If you had been indifferent, that would have been irresponsible."



"Are you very familiar with Thunder?" Roland asked, "Your concern for Lightning truly goes beyond the ordinary affection for the children of heroes."



Faced with this question, Margaret hesitated for a moment. Roland indicated that if she did not want to answer, she could pretend he had never asked, but she eventually spoke slowly, "Without hiding it from you, after I left the fishing village, I joined Lord Thunder's exploration team and experienced a long journey of exploration with him. As a newcomer to the team, both Lord Thunder and his wife took great care of me, and I was present on the day Lightning was born."



"She was born on a ship?"



"Yes, during a violent storm. The thunder and lightning outside the cabin never ceased, and shortly after her birth, Lord Thunder's wife passed away due to sepsis, and I... acted as her half mother. Without breast milk, I fed her chewed wheat porridge mixed with fish roe powder bit by bit." Margaret's voice became very tender, "Although Lord Thunder was in immense grief, he still had to command the fleet to move forward—without a keystone, the crew could easily collapse during the months-long voyage. And I stayed in the cabin, watching Lightning grow up slowly. It wasn't until Lord Thunder found the Shadow Islands and successfully returned to Sea Dragon Bay that the exploration ended. After that, I... left the fjord and settled down in the capital of Greycastle."



"So that's how it is," Roland thought to himself, no wonder she had such a strong reaction upon hearing the name Thunder. As for why she didn't continue to follow Thunder on his adventures, he could roughly guess the reason. Having the beginning of a love story doesn't necessarily mean you'll get a happy ending.



What a dramatic turn of events... Now that there's this connection, could it be possible to get a bigger discount on our dealings? He coughed twice and said, "Miss Margaret, now that we can consider each other acquainted, about the trade—"



"Your Highness, that won't do," Margaret said with a smile, "Business is business, and that is an unchanging principle of merchants."
