## The First Step in Building a City
Petro stepped out of the cabin and did not smell the anticipated odor of rotting wood. The wharf by the ship's side was clearly newly built; the old dock had more than doubled in size and no longer creaked underfoot. Instead, there was a reassuring thud—evidently, the planks were joined firmly together, and the material used was quite thick.



After descending from the dock, several uniformed guards approached him. The leader sized up the coat of arms hanging from the mast of the Lionheart and asked, "Excuse me, are you... Lord Helmon of the Goldflower family?"



"Yes," Petro nodded, quite pleased with the inquiry, "I am Petro Helmon, here at His Highness's invitation."



"Lord Iron Axe has already informed us, please follow me," the guard gestured.



"On foot?" he asked, slightly taken aback.



"Yes, the stables have been dismantled," the guard said with an apologetic smile, "Don't worry, the roads in town are very walkable."



Petro quickly understood what the guard meant by "walkable."



The dark streets were flat and spacious, the snow had been swept clean, and there was scarcely any standing water—the roads seemed to be made of many black pebbles bonded together, with fine gaps in between that became shiny and smooth when soaked with water. What surprised him even more was that there was not just one such road; every hundred steps or so, there was a straight crossing path, as neatly arranged as squares drawn with a pen. After walking for a quarter of an hour, not a single muddy spot was to be seen.



To Petro's amazement, the small town was completely unrecognizable from his memory.



"My lord, is this really... Border Town?" Seth's eyes widened as he looked around. "Wasn't it said that this place was merely a temporary residence set up for mining?"



"It used to be," the guard replied with a smile. "But everything began to change after His Highness arrived. The roads in town, for instance, were constructed half a year ago. Back then, there were thousands of people working every day, and it was possible to build a road in almost a month."



Petro noticed the undeniable pride in his tone, as if he were proud to be a member of the town.



But... this was simply unbelievable! There were evenly spaced trees lining the streets, and he could imagine the scene when the lush leaves would provide shade from the scorching summer sun; then there were the houses—gone were the low mud huts and the dilapidated wooden inns, replaced by sharp-angled brick houses, each two to three stories high, obviously built by the same group of masons.



How could he have transformed a barren town into this in just one year?



With surprise and confusion, Petro followed the guard into the castle district, where a knight clad in armor took over as their guide, while his own retainers were left outside the walls.



It wasn't until he stepped into the lord's castle that Petro found the feeling he remembered from a year ago.



It seemed not much had changed here; the prince's castle was obviously much smaller compared to the fortress of the Duke.



The knight opened the door to the parlor and made a welcoming gesture, and soon, Petro saw the prince sitting in the main seat.



His Highness Roland Wimbledon.



"Welcome to Border Town," Roland said with a smile, "Mr. 'Ambassador'."



It seemed that the prince hadn't changed much, and Petro found himself inexplicably relieved. He raised his hand to his chest and bowed respectfully, "The Goldrose family sends their regards, Your Highness."



"Please sit," the other party nodded, "I've called you here because there is a very important matter at hand. This matter is related to the future of the entire Western Region, naturally including Longsong Stronghold."



"Please, speak your mind."



"I plan to build a city here. The city will extend west to the Misty Forest and east to Longsong Stronghold, encompassing half of the Western Region. In time, the stronghold will serve as an outpost on the eastern side of the new city and as the first line of defense against the Church's army, rather than an independent city as it is now." Roland laid out his plans methodically, "Within this vast territory, we must implement the same laws and accept unified management by the new city hall. No noble will be allowed to meddle in the city's affairs, and that includes the five great families of the Western Region."



Petro felt his heart jolt! A year ago, he too had entertained such a thought—having Duke Ryan move the defense line against the evil beasts to Border Town and utilizing the land between the two places. But unexpectedly, a year later, the prince had adopted this approach, and his methods were even more thorough than Petro had imagined. Turning Longsong Stronghold into a part of a city? Just imagining it, one could understand how astonishing the scale of the city would be!



Instinctively, he wanted to voice his doubts, but the words choked back in his throat—the prince, having disclosed this matter to him, had undoubtedly made his decision, and now no one could stop him from implementing this plan.



Petro had never thought about resisting the prince... The tragic defeat of Duke Ryan had left too strong an impression on him, and he even felt that this gray-haired man could not be defeated, at least... not by himself. So the only thing to do was to seek his own interests in the midst of this great change.



"You say that the five major families cannot intervene in the city's affairs, then how can Jasmine be of service to you?"

The prince remained silent for a while, until Petro felt slightly uneasy, then he chuckled, "You really surprise me, Mr. Ambassador. Whether it was the previous proposal to redeem the fortress or the proactive attitude you have shown now, both are wise decisions rarely seen among the nobles."

After a sigh, he then became serious and said, "As long as the Jasmine family is willing to accept my rule, you can continue to assist me in managing the Longsong District."

"Both my father and I have always followed your will—"

"I'm not talking about individuals, but about the territory," Roland interrupted, "In the future, the nobles under my protection will only have ownership of their lands, not the right to govern them — whether it is legislation, law enforcement, or other policies, they will all be in accordance with the decrees issued by the city hall."

"This..." Petro hesitated.

"The lands can be inherited generation after generation, just like the title. Your family can also manage farmlands, workshops, or other livelihoods. These industries, along with the land, belong to the Jasmine family and will not be encroached upon by others — this is also the protection I promise. Apart from the governance rights, the land you own remains unchanged, and may even become more prosperous under the stimulation of new policies," the prince continued, "Of course, you can also choose to return to your own territory and continue to be a traditional feudal noble. However, once I finish the expansion of the new city and expand outwards, the areas occupied will no longer belong to their original owners."
