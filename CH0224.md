## Launch the rescue.
Upon learning that His Highness had a method to cure the demonic plague, Theo's anxious heart finally settled down.

Moreover, once there were tasks to be busy with, the following days seemed to pass by much quicker.

Aside from visiting the wineries in the suburbs and planning the caravan's route, he also memorized the terrain from the canal dock to the city gate.

Nowadays, entering the King's City had become much more troublesome. Due to the refugees outside the city, all the major gates had been closed, forbidding outsiders from entering—especially since people knew that the Church was distributing the Holy Medicine. Every day, desperate crowds would charge at the gates, hoping to seek treatment from the Church, while the guards on the walls responded without hesitation with crossbow bolts. Now, there were already many corpses piled up at the city gates, emitting an unpleasant smell under the scorching sun.

The only side gate that remained open was limited to nobles and merchants transporting food—fortunately, Theo had served in the patrol team for quite a long time and was a local of the King's City. Most of the guards knew him, so he could simply greet them when entering and exiting.

Because of this, the contact between inside and outside the city was almost cut off. Even though refugees were being transported openly at the docks, it was difficult for the news to reach inside the city. Moreover, for the upper-class nobles, they would rather have someone take away all these East Region refugees, who could potentially explode at any moment, to avoid having to mobilize the patrol team later to suppress any revolts.

Theo probably understood why His Highness decided to set out on the day he received the letter. These people had been abandoned by the King's City. If the Church were to send out priests to distribute the Holy Medicine at this time, most of the refugees would likely become devout believers.

If His Highness could take these people under his command before the Church did, bringing them to a new life and a place to live in peace, there was no doubt they would become ardent supporters of His Highness.

On the morning of the fourth day, the returning fleet arrived at the canal dock on time. Theo was surprised to find that the First Army soldiers sent by His Highness numbered as many as three hundred, and they were mostly equipped with revolving rifles. With such a powerful force for protection, even if the Church learned of this, they would probably be powerless to stop the refugees from leaving.



"Lightning!" Upon seeing the little girl's figure, Margaret, who was also waiting at the dock, couldn't wait to walk up and embrace her.

"Who is this...?" Iron Axe asked.

"The owner of King's City's big chamber of commerce, Miss Margaret," Theo introduced. "All the ships needed for this transport were contacted and provided by her. She has contributed a lot to ensure that the plan could be carried out."

"I see," Iron Axe nodded to her in acknowledgment, "Thank you for your help."

"I will deduct the expenses from His Highness," she shrugged, "and rather than thanking me, you should thank Lightning."

Lightning tilted her head, "Why?"

"Cough cough, it's nothing," Theo coughed twice, "What do you plan to do next?"

"Set up camp to the south of the dock and take control of the dock area, then start the rescue this afternoon," Iron Axe said. "As for the ships, we'll be counting on you."

...



Iron Axe led his men into the refugee area and couldn't help but frown.

Everywhere were patients barely clinging to life, their skin cracked and oozing black blood and pus, attracting swarms of flies. Yet they lacked the strength to swat them away, allowing the insects to crawl over their bodies, feasting on their blood.

He was reminded of the Evil Months, when the people of Border Town were trapped in the slums of the stronghold, equally powerless against starvation and the cold. If this was truly the work of the Church, it was an unforgivable crime.

"First, gather those who can still move," Iron Axe said. "Echo, it's up to you."

Rashly announcing that they had medicines capable of treating the plague might cause a sensation. If everyone rushed to the dock area, his few dozen men would be unable to hold them back. Therefore, the message had to be delivered in batches, and this was why His Highness had arranged for Echo to accompany them—her ability could target a specific area or whisper directly into someone's ear.

Iron Axe saw her open her mouth but heard no sound, yet people in the crowd began looking over.

Soon, a group of people stumbled towards them. "Sir, is what you said true? I'll follow you to the Western Region if you can cure this disease!"

It worked, Iron Axe thought with relief. "Of course, our ships are already at the dock area. Bring your families and come with me!"

Other soldiers stepped forward to help carry those who were lying on the ground, unable to move. In an instant, the group swelled to several hundred people, heading towards the canal docks. Many others noticed the scene and followed. Back at the docks, the First Army soldiers had placed bags of purified water on a long table, and the entrance to the boarding plank was guarded by Iron Axe's men. Only two people were allowed through at a time, ensuring all who boarded drank the purified water.



"Listen up, everyone," announced the soldier standing on a platform beside the long table, "these water bags contain medicine for treating the sickness. Just drink it, and you'll be cured immediately." He continued to read from His Highness's manuscript, "The Church's claim that 'the demonic plague is caused by witches and only holy medicine can cure it' is utter nonsense. They just want to make more money and have you kneel in gratitude for saving your lives. But Prince Roland not only brings you the potion, he does not charge a penny for it! Yes, not even a single bronze royal!"



These words stirred the crowd, and the first person to drink the purification water soon felt his body change. He incredulously tore open his shirt, watching as the black spots rapidly faded, "The medicine really works! I'm cured, I'm cured!"



"Me too, by the gods, my wounds have stopped bleeding!"



"Gods? Where are they? I only see a bunch of swindlers!"



"You're right, this medicine has nothing to do with the Church!"



"Long live Prince Roland!"



As more and more people recovered, the crowd's reaction grew more fervent. If it weren't for the First Army soldiers maintaining order, the long table with the water bags might have been overwhelmed by the refugees.



"Currently, Prince Roland is developing the Western Territory and needs a large number of people to cultivate the land, build houses, and construct roads..." the soldier continued to proclaim loudly, "He doesn't charge for the potion, nor does he force you to go to the Western Territory," he declared, "but His Highness has promised that those willing to go to the Western Territory and serve him will receive food, shelter, and a salary! No matter what skills you have, you will find a job that matches your talents! Those willing, step forward and follow the mercenaries onto the ship, to your new home! And for those who are not willing, it's okay, you may leave after helping us for three days, and during these three days, the food will also be provided for free by the caravan!"



"Is it true that we'll have a place to live and a salary?" someone in the crowd asked loudly.



"Of course, these are the conditions personally stated by Prince Roland!" the soldier nodded in response.

"Please let me board the ship, I am willing to serve His Highness!"

"Me too!"

"And me, sir!"

"I am a blacksmith!"

"..."

Barov watched with joy as this group of several hundred people, not a single one chose to stay in the capital, but all boarded the sailing ships headed for the Western Region. As soon as a ship was full, it immediately set off, with the subsequent empty ships continuously following, without the slightest pause under Margaret's command.

Barov then continuously went back and forth between the refugee camp and the dock, using the voice transmission spell Echo to rally batch after batch of refugees from the Eastern Region, each time keeping the number to around three to four hundred people. Just as he was returning to the dock with a new group of sick recruits, he suddenly saw the First Army stationed in the southern wheat fields spring into action. A squad rushed towards the northern bank of the canal at high speed, with their guns already in their hands.

"What happened?" he asked Iron Axe's subordinate.



"Lady Lightning from the scouts reported that someone secretly jumped ship and escaped," the other party said after saluting. "Probably a rat hiding among the refugees?"
