## Mount an Rescue Operation.
Tassa's restless heart finally calmed down after learning that His Highness had a way to cure the demonic plague.

Moreover, once he had things to keep himself busy, the following days seemed to pass by much faster.

In addition to visiting the wineries in the suburbs and planning the caravan's route, he also committed to memory the terrain from the canal dock to the city gate.

Nowadays, entering the King's City had become much more troublesome. Due to the refugees outside the city, all the major gates of the capital had been closed, forbidding outsiders from entering—especially since it was known that the Church was distributing the holy medicine, every day, desperate crowds would storm the gates hoping to seek treatment from the Church, and the guards on the walls would respond with crossbows without hesitation. Now there were many corpses piled up at the gates, emitting a foul smell under the scorching sun.

The only side gate that was open was limited to nobles and merchants transporting food—fortunately, Tassa had served in the patrol team for quite a long time, and being a local of the King's City, most of the guards knew him, so he could simply greet them when entering and exiting.

It was precisely because of this that there was almost no contact between the inside and outside of the city. Even if refugees were transported at the docks with great fanfare, it was difficult for the news to reach inside the city. Moreover, for the upper-class nobles, they would rather have someone take all these refugees from the Eastern Region away, who could potentially explode at any time, so they wouldn't have to gather the patrol teams to suppress riots later on.

Tassa probably understood the feelings of His Highness on the day he received the letter and decided to leave immediately. These people had been abandoned by the King's City, and if the Church were to send priests out of the city to distribute the holy medicine at this time, most of the refugees would likely become devout believers.

If His Highness could pull these people under his command before the Church did, bringing them new life and a place to live in peace, there was no doubt that they would become fervent supporters of His Highness.

On the morning of the fourth day, the returning fleet arrived at the canal dock on time, and Tassa was surprised to find that the First Army soldiers sent by His Highness numbered as many as three hundred men, and they were mostly equipped with revolving rifles. With this powerful force as a guarantee, even if the Church got wind of the news, they would probably be powerless to prevent the refugees from leaving.



"Lightning!" As soon as Maggie saw the little girl's figure waiting at the dock, she couldn't wait to walk up and hug her.

"Who is this...?" Iron Axe asked.

"The owner of the King's City Great Merchant, Lady Maggie," Tassa introduced, "All the ships needed for the transport were contacted and provided by her. She has contributed a lot to ensure the plan could be implemented."

"I see," Iron Axe nodded to her in greeting, "Thank you for your help."

"I'll deduct the expenses from His Highness," she shrugged, "and rather than thanking me, you should thank Lightning."

Lightning cocked her head to the side, "Why?"

"Cough cough, it's nothing," Tassa coughed twice, "What are your plans next?"

"Set up a camp south of the dock and take control of the dock area, and start the rescue in the afternoon," Iron Axe said. "As for the ships, we'll leave them in your capable hands."

...



Brian led his subordinates into the refugee area and couldn't help but frown.



Everywhere there were patients on their last breath, their skin cracked open, oozing black blood and pus, attracting swarms of flies. Yet, they didn't have the strength to swat them away, letting the insects crawl over their bodies, feasting on their blood.



He couldn't help but be reminded of the Evil Months, when the people of Border Town were trapped in the slums of the fortress, helpless against the onslaught of hunger and cold. If this was truly the work of the Church, it was an unforgivable crime.



"Let's gather those who can still move," Brian said. "It's up to you now, Miss Echo."



To rashly announce that they had medicine capable of treating the plague would undoubtedly cause a sensation, potentially leading to a swarm of people at the dock area. They couldn't suppress such a crowd with just their few dozen men. Therefore, they had to notify the people in batches, and bringing Echo along was precisely for this reason—her ability allowed her to direct her voice to a specific area, or right beside someone's ear.



Brian only saw her open her mouth without making any sound, yet refugees began to look their way.



Soon, a group of people stumbled over, "Sir, is what you said true? If you can cure this disease, I am willing to follow you to the Western Region!"



It had worked, Brian thought with joy, "Of course, our ship is already docked in the port area. Bring your family and follow me!"



Other soldiers also stepped forward to help carry those lying on the ground who couldn't move, and in an instant, the procession swelled to several hundred people heading towards the canal docks. Many others noticed this scene and followed suit. Back at the docks, the First Army soldiers had placed bags of purified water on a long table, while the entrance to the boarding pier was guarded by Iron Axe's team, allowing only two people to pass at a time, ensuring all those boarding drank the purified water.



"Listen up, everyone, these water bags contain medicine for treating illnesses. Just by drinking it, you will be cured immediately." Beside the long table, there was also a platform where a soldier stood, constantly preaching His Highness's manuscript, "The Church's so-called 'demonic plague caused by witches, which only the holy medicine can cure,' is completely nonsensical. They just want to make more money and have you knee in gratitude for saving your lives. But Prince Roland not only brought the potion, he is not charging any fee! That's right, not even a single bronze royal!"



These words stirred up a commotion among the crowd, and the first person who drank the purification water quickly felt a change in his body. He incredulously tore open his clothes to see the black spots rapidly fading away, "The medicine really works! I'm cured, I'm cured!"



"Me too, by the gods, my wounds have stopped bleeding!"



"Gods? Where are they? I only see a bunch of swindlers!"



"That's right, this medicine has nothing to do with the Church!"



"Long live Prince Roland!"



As more and more people recovered, the crowd's reaction grew more and more fervent. If not for the First Army soldiers maintaining order, the long table where the water bags were placed would have been immediately overwhelmed by the refugees.



"Currently, Prince Roland is developing the Western Territory, needing a large number of people to farm the lands, build houses, and construct roads..." the soldier responsible for the announcements continued loudly, "He doesn't charge for the potion, nor does he force you to go to the Western Territory," the soldier in charge of the announcements continued loudly, "but His Highness promises that those willing to go to the Western Territory and serve him will receive food, housing, and a salary! No matter what skills you have, you can find a job that matches your abilities! Those willing, step forward, follow the mercenaries on board the ships, and head to your new homes! Those unwilling, it's alright too; you may leave after assisting us for three days, and the food for these three days will also be provided by the merchant convoy for free!"



"Is it true there are housing and a salary?" someone asked loudly.



"Of course, these are the terms personally stated by Prince Roland!" the soldier nodded in response.

"Please let me aboard, I wish to serve His Highness!"

"Me too!"

"And me, my lord!"

"I am a blacksmith!"

"..."

Barov watched with joy as this group of hundreds of people, not a single one chose to stay in the capital, but all boarded the sailboat heading to the Western Region. As soon as one ship was full, it set off immediately, and the subsequent empty ships followed one after another, without the slightest pause under the command of Margaret.

Subsequently, Barov shuttled back and forth between the refugee camp and the dock, leveraging the art of echoing to attract batch after batch of refugees from the Eastern Region, each time controlling the number to within three to four hundred people. Just as he was returning to the dock with a group of newly recruited patients, he suddenly saw the First Army stationed in the southern wheat fields spring into action. A squad dashed towards the northern bank of the canal at high speed, with their firearms already in hand.

"What's happened?" he asked the subordinate of Iron Axe.



"Miss Lightning from the scouts reported that someone sneaked away by jumping off the ship," the other party said after saluting, "Probably a rat hiding among the refugees?"
