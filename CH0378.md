## Oxygen and Nitrogen
This experiment holds significant practical importance and also serves as an excellent educational opportunity. Therefore, in addition to the participants Agatha, Sylvie, Chem, and Camilla Dary, Roland summoned all the other members of the Witch Union, Carter, Iron Axe, and Barov to attend as well. To accommodate this group of more than twenty people, the experiment was held in the largest space available, Laboratory No. 5.



Considering this was the first attempt, the distilling device wasn't made too large—roughly the height of a person and one meter in diameter, resembling a tower. The interior of the container was divided into three layers, with the bottom layer for air intake and the top two layers for exhaust.



Before starting the separation, Roland gave everyone a simple chemistry lesson to explain what might happen and also posed several questions, encouraging them to find the answers on their own. This not only piqued the listeners' interest but also greatly enhanced the teaching effect—a technique commonly used by chemistry teachers.



"...In theory, when Agatha lowers the temperature inside the container, the air will gradually condense into liquid and drip down through the perforated partition plate to the bottom layer. So when you see liquid accumulating at the bottom, let us know."



Since it was impossible to directly observe the process, they had to rely on Sylvie to look through the container and describe the changes, so Roland explained this part in particular detail.



Sylvie nodded skeptically, "Are we really going to see liquid form? Couldn't it just be condensation inside the jar?"



"Don't worry, liquefied air is pale blue, completely different from water vapor," Roland reassured, waving his hand. "Besides, at that temperature, any water vapor would have already frozen into ice crystals." He then gestured to Agatha, "Let's begin."



"Wait a moment... Shouldn't we plug this hole at the bottom of the container?" she asked.



"We'll plug it later. If we do it now, there's too little air inside the jar, making it hard to observe any obvious changes." Since this was just a test, Roland chose the simplest method to draw in air—when the temperature inside the jar rapidly dropped, the pressure would decrease, causing air from outside to continuously flow in. This method wouldn't be cost-effective for regular production since the cold air would keep escaping, wasting energy. But Agatha was using magic power, and her cooling efficiency far surpassed any refrigeration unit, so Roland didn't bother preparing an air pump to inflate it.



Agatha took a deep breath and placed her hands on the fractionating column.

In the span of a few breaths, a whistling sound emerged from the air intake, the noise of the air rushing in quickly. Layers of white frost appeared around the pipe at a visible rate and continued to expand—the moisture in the air quickly condensed due to the overflowing cold and attached to the outer wall of the vessel. Anna turned the blackfire into threads, clearing away the thickening ice crystals.



After a short while, Sylvie exclaimed in surprise, "I see liquid forming on the partition, but there's more white frost."

"The white frost could be the incoming water vapor or crystallized carbon dioxide," Roland explained, "Considering the low concentration of carbon dioxide in the air, most of it should be water vapor."

If this was to be done in actual production, the air would need to be dried before being drawn into the fractionating column, otherwise the condensed water vapor could clog the trays and exhaust holes, reducing production efficiency.



About half a quarter of an hour later, Sylvie reported that the bottom of the container was filled with blue liquid, and only then did Roland instruct Sorya to block the air intake and seal it with a coating.

Next came the critical heating step.

Given the different melting and boiling points of nitrogen and oxygen, nitrogen would reach its boiling point first, turning into a gas and escaping upwards, thus achieving separation. Roland didn't remember the exact temperature and currently had no means to measure it; he could only rely on Agatha to control it. This would be indicated by gas escaping from the exhaust hole at the top of the fractionating column, while the remaining liquid at the bottom would become increasingly blue, signifying the rising purity of the liquid oxygen.

Fortunately, Agatha was familiar with controlling magic power. She adjusted the cooling rate precisely, allowing it to gradually increase again, and soon Sylvie observed the phenomenon of the liquid surface boiling. Bubbles began to emerge from the coated pipe submerged in water, and Camilla quickly collected several bottles of gas using the water displacement gas collection method.



"Is this nitrogen?" Lily pouted. "I can't see anything at all."



"That was the first question I mentioned before," Roland asked, "How can we prove that it's different from air?"



"By lighting it," Tilly was the first to answer. "Elementary Chemistry says that combustion requires oxygen. If it's another gas, it should extinguish a burning stick instantly."



"By cooling it back into a liquid, we'll know," Agatha pondered for a moment before saying, "Didn't you say that liquid nitrogen is colorless?"



"Or we could remove the remaining liquid from the container, proving that it's pure oxygen, which would also demonstrate the diversity of air components," Anna chimed in.



The scene had completely turned into a show of academic prowess, with one testing method after another being proposed and then discussed among the few voices left in the laboratory. Roland looked around and found that Nightingale, Andrea, Maggie, and the other witches, as well as the town hall manager and the chief knight Carter, all had a look of bewilderment. Iron Axe, the commander of the First Army, maintained an expression that seemed to indicate he would nod and agree no matter what was being said.



Well, Roland sighed inwardly, it seems this chemistry lesson was a bit too advanced.



If anyone could still feel the prince's delight at this moment, it would probably be only Kyle Sichi and Chemis.



"Your Highness, this is truly... magical," the young alchemist exclaimed, "You've proven the correctness of 'Elementary Chemistry.' Probably no alchemists would have expected that even the air around us, so readily available, could be so complex."



"With pure oxygen, can we observe more intense oxidation reactions? I have many experiments I want to try," Kyle said excitedly.

Roland nodded, but another idea suddenly emerged in his mind.

Nitrogen is the main raw material for the industrial synthesis of ammonia, which reacts with hydrogen under high temperature and pressure with a catalyst to produce ammonia. The latter can not only be used to manufacture nitrogen fertilizers but also to synthesize nitric oxide, thus producing nitric acid. However, to achieve this process, there was still much work to be done, such as air pumps, vacuum gas storage tanks, and a series of complex reaction equipment. Even if White Paper could provide the function of a catalyst, repeated experiments would be necessary.

Now that he had both pure oxygen and pure nitrogen, why not directly produce nitric oxide?

Admittedly, the chemical industry chooses to produce nitric acid from ammonia because the reaction between oxygen and nitrogen is endothermic and cannot occur spontaneously; it requires an external energy supply, such as electrical discharge—by heating the gases to thousands of degrees momentarily through an electric arc, which is why the soil is more fertile in places with frequent lightning. Because of this, the method requires sophisticated equipment and consumes a lot of energy, making it unsuitable for formal production.

However, if there is a need to increase production capacity urgently, this method is the most efficient. It doesn't even require a catalyst, just continuous electrical discharge... or other means to achieve the high temperatures produced by an electric arc.

Naturally, Roland thought of Blackfire.

Blackfire's heating efficiency is no worse than an electric arc, and it places a very low burden on Anna. As long as the nitrogen oxides are purified and mixed in proportion into a sealed reaction vessel, nitric oxide can be continuously produced.

He decided to try this method.
