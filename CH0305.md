## Chemical Breakthrough
The witches and the First Army set out four days ago, and according to the plan, they should arrive at the outskirts of Silver City by tomorrow afternoon.

Equipped with the flying messenger bees with honey, Roland received letters from the team every day—there were letters from Iron Axe, Anna, and even Nightingale. Although it wasn't as swift as a mobile phone, it was essentially similar to a telegraph. If there were several times more messenger bees on this route, constantly flying back and forth between the two places, it might even be possible to simulate the effect of text chatting.

In Nightingale's absence, the Chief Knight took over the responsibility of defending the castle. However, Roland was puzzled that these days, Carter always seemed cheerful as if he had encountered something exceptionally happy. Could it be that returning to his original job and being responsible for guarding him was so delightful?

He shook his head and turned his attention to the report from Minister of Construction Karl Barton.

With the assistance of the witches from Sleeping Island, the construction projects in Border Town had made rapid progress over the past month.

Firstly, the completion of the steel bridge over the Redwater River went smoothly—compared to traditional stone bridges and wooden bridges, the steel structure could be prefabricated and then installed as a whole. With the two floating islands raised by Lotus in the river, the difficulty of setting up was further simplified, shortening the main bridge construction period to an astonishing one month.

Even though from a modern perspective, it was short and narrow, structurally crude, with an extremely low load capacity, and a sheer waste of materials equivalent to a shoddy construction project, in this era, it was considered a grand and spectacular super bridge—it was over a hundred meters long, with a flat bridge deck wide enough for two carriages to pass side by side, and the lower part could accommodate inland sailing ships, none of which a cumbersome stone bridge could achieve.

Secondly, the new city wall built by Lotus was also completed. This pure earthen wall had more than doubled the area of the town. If a city were to be built in the future, the original town would become the so-called "Inner City District." However, Roland was more inclined to the concept of the First and Second Rings. Perhaps one day, this place could expand into a giant city with seven rings, officially crowned as the Imperial Capital.

Lastly, there was the construction of the Kingdom's Main Road, where some of the foothills stretching down from the Impassable Mountain Range were leveled by Lotus, allowing the road to pass straight through and significantly reducing the total construction period.



"Your Highness, what are your plans for the next construction project that Lily has arranged?" Karl asked after reporting on the progress of various tasks.

It was apparent that he was envious of the ability to alter terrain, to the point where he was just short of openly suggesting that she should be brought into the Ministry of Construction and appointed as the deputy minister.

"Um..." Roland was also pondering this question, as he had three major reconstruction projects to implement next.

The first was the seaport project: to find a low gap in the mountain range at the southern end and then lower it to create a road that could lead in and out of the shallows. This was something that could only be achieved with Lily's abilities. Once the transformation was complete, the Western Region would have a harbor facing the sea.

The second was residential expansion: although the City Hall had invested a lot of manpower and financial resources to expedite the construction of residential quarters, nearly three thousand people might still be unable to move into warm brick houses when winter arrived. The wooden sheds and simple dwellings set up now were utterly inadequate for keeping out the cold, so he needed a batch of cave dwellings with thick walls and heated kang beds to solve this problem.

The last point was the construction of a shipyard: to produce shallow-water heavy gunboats, he would have to lay out a spacious dockyard without affecting the passage of the Redwater River. Roland planned to lower the height of a section of the river embankment at the west end of the town to form a dry dock and install a lift gate on the side close to the Redwater River to control the water for retention and release. The scale of the earthwork was enormous and would also rely on Lily's abilities to complete.

After considering for a moment, he finally decided to prioritize residential expansion, as he was responsible for the food, clothing, shelter, and transportation of the refugees from the Eastern Region brought to Border Town. If they were to freeze or starve to death, it would not only be a loss for the Western Region but would also reduce the sense of belonging the citizens had for this place.

"Then where will this temporary housing be located?" Karl continued to ask.

"Let's set it up in the current serf shanty area," Roland glanced at the map and said, "It's far from the city wall defenses and has the Impassable Mountain Range to block the wind."



After the Minister of Construction retired, just as he was about to doze off in his chair, Kyle Sichi came to see him.

"Your Highness, I have successfully developed the large-scale acid-making method you requested."

These words immediately dispelled Roland's fatigue, and he stood up excitedly from his desk and said, "Really? Take me to see it right away."

A group of people arrived at the laboratory by the Redwater River, where they saw several grayish-white tanks and a furnace set up next to Laboratory No.5. Each tank was about the height of two men and had pipes connecting them at the top. Their neat and smooth shapes were clearly cut out by Anna.

"My respects, Your Highness," a very young-looking lad bowed deeply to Roland.

"You must be Chemist, right?" Although Roland already knew that Kyle had recruited a group of alchemy apprentices from Redwater City and had also won over an outstanding alchemist, this was still the first time he had seen him in person.

"You actually remember my name," Chemist said in surprise.

"Mr. Sichi has mentioned you many times," Roland patted him on the shoulder as a sign of encouragement, "Keep up the good work." Then he turned to the Chief Alchemist, "How is this made into acid?"

Kyle stroked his beard and smiled, "Its successful development is entirely deduced from the reaction formulas in 'Elementary Chemistry.' You see that furnace over there; the purified sulfur will burn in the kiln, and the gas produced will be further heated and then sent into the lead tanks."



"Are all these devices made of lead?"

"That's right, only lead can resist the corrosion of acid," Kyle nodded. "The lead pipe at the top of the jar continuously sprinkles nitrosulfuric acid, and under the scorching dioxide gas, the nitric acid decomposes into nitrogen oxides when heated. Finally, it reacts with water and dioxide to form a sulfuric acid solution, which flows out from the hole at the bottom—The ingenuity of this reaction lies in the nitrogen oxides only acting as an oxygen carrier, without being consumed themselves, so the amount of nitric acid required is small. Once the reaction starts, it can continue indefinitely!"

"What's the production like?" Roland asked excitedly, patting the lead jar. Mass production of acid was a prerequisite for producing smokeless powder on a large scale. If this problem could be solved, there was hope for the ammunition of the new generation of repeating rifles and cannons.

"This is the fourth device I've made, and its daily output is about equal to a week's worth of production from the dry distillation method in the laboratory," the Chief Alchemist said proudly. "Since it's a trial, the device isn't very large. If we could build a larger lead jar, we could further increase the production."

"That's great news," Roland said with a smile. "Once Miss Anna returns, you can start building a larger scale acid production device right away. Additionally, if we run short of lead, we can use iron as a substitute, Miss Soria's coating can protect iron from acid corrosion."

Kyle nodded in agreement, but his next words froze the prince's smile on his face.

"Now that we have made progress with the mass production of acid, and all five laboratories are filled with apprentices, Your Highness, may I receive the 'Intermediate Chemistry' you promised me?"
