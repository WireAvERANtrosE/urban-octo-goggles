## Chemical Breakthrough
The Witch and the First Army had set out four days ago, and according to the plan, they should arrive in the outskirts of Silver City by tomorrow afternoon.

With the flying messengers equipped with honey, Roland could receive letters from the team every day—there were letters from Iron Axe, from Anna, and also from Nightingale. Although it wasn't as swift as mobile phones, it was basically akin to wireless telegraphy. If the number of flying messengers on this route were to be multiplied several times, with birds constantly traveling between the two places, it might even be possible to simulate the effect of text messaging.

In Nightingale's absence, the Chief Knight took over the heavy responsibility of defending the castle. However, what puzzled Roland was the fact that Carter seemed to be in a particularly cheerful mood these days, as if he had encountered something exceedingly joyful. Could it be that returning to his original duties and being responsible for protecting him personally was so gratifying?

He shook his head, turning his attention to the report from Minister of Construction Karl Barton.

With the assistance of the witches from Sleeping Island, the construction projects in Border Town had progressed at a miraculous speed over the past month.

Firstly, the completion of the steel bridge over the Redwater River was a smooth success—compared to traditional stone and wooden bridges, the steel body of the bridge could be prefabricated and then hoisted into place as a whole. With the addition of the two floating islands that Lotus raised in the river, the difficulty of its assembly was further simplified, shortening the main bridge construction period to an astonishing one month.

Even though from a modern perspective, it was short and narrow, structurally crude, with an extremely low load-bearing capacity, amounting to a shoddy project that wasted materials, in this era, it was considered a grand and spectacular super bridge—with a total length of over a hundred meters, with a flat bridge deck that allowed two horse-drawn carriages to pass side by side, and the lower part could accommodate the passage of inland sailing ships, none of which the cumbersome stone bridges could achieve.

Next, the new city wall that Lotus constructed was also completed. This pure earthen wall had more than doubled the area of the small town. If a city were to be built in the future, the original town would become a true "inner city district." However, Roland was more inclined to the terms first and second rings. Perhaps one day in the future, this place could also be expanded into a giant city with seven rings, officially crowned with the name of the imperial capital.

Finally, there was the construction of the Kingdom's main road. Some of the foothills spreading out from the Impassable Mountain Range were leveled by Lotus, allowing the road to pass straight through, greatly reducing the total construction period.



"Your Highness, what are your plans for the next construction project that Lily has arranged?" Karl asked after reporting the progress of various projects.

It was clear that he was envious of the ability to transform the terrain, and he was just short of asking to include her in the construction department and appoint her as the deputy minister on the spot.

"Um..." Roland was also thinking about this issue, as he had three major transformation projects awaiting implementation.

The first was the seaport project: find a low gap in the southern mountain range and then sink it to create a road that can go in and out of the shallows, something that could only be done with Lily's ability. Once the transformation was completed, the Western Region would have a harbor facing the sea.

The second was housing expansion: although the City Hall had invested a lot of manpower and resources to accelerate the construction of residential areas, nearly three thousand people might still be unable to move into warm brick houses when winter arrived. The wooden shacks and makeshift dwellings that were currently set up could not meet the needs for keeping out the cold, so he needed a batch of cave dwellings with thick walls and heated kang beds to solve this problem.

The last point was the construction of a shipyard: to produce shallow-water heavy gunships, he had to lay down a spacious shipyard without affecting the passage of the Redwater River. Roland planned to lower the height of a river embankment at the west end of the town to form a dry dock and install a lift-type sluice gate on the side close to the Redwater River to control water retention and drainage. The scale of the earthwork was huge, and it also relied on Lily's ability to complete.

After considering for a moment, he finally decided to prioritize housing expansion. Since he had brought the refugees from the Eastern Region to Border Town, he had to take responsibility for their food, clothing, shelter, and transportation. If they died from freezing or starvation, it would not only be a loss for the Western Region but would also reduce the sense of belonging the citizens had to this place.

"Then where will this temporary housing be located?" Karl followed up.

"Let's set it up in the current serf shanty area," Roland said, glancing at the map, "far from the city wall defenses and with the Impassable Mountain Range to block the wind."



After the Minister of Construction resigned, Roland had just wanted to lean back in his chair for a nap when Kaimo Van’er came looking for him.



"Your Highness, the large-scale acid production method you requested, I have successfully developed it."



This statement immediately dispelled Roland's fatigue, and he stood up excitedly from his desk, "Really? Take me to see it."



The group arrived at the laboratory by the Redwater River, where several gray-white tanks and a furnace had been set up next to Laboratory No. 5. Each tank was about two people tall, with pipes connecting them at the top, and their neat and smooth shapes were obviously cut by Anna.



"My respects to you, Your Highness," a very young man said, bowing to Roland.



"Are you Chemis?" Although Roland had known that Kaimo had recruited a group of alchemy apprentices from Redwater City and even attracted a distinguished alchemist, today was the first time he had seen him.



"You actually remember my name," Chemis said in surprise.



"Mr. Van’er has mentioned you many times," Roland patted his shoulder encouragingly, "Keep up the good work." Then he looked toward the Chief Alchemist, "How is this thing used to produce acid?"



Kaimo stroked his beard and smiled, "Its success is entirely based on the reaction formula derived from 'Elementary Chemistry.' You see that furnace? The purified sulfur will burn in the kiln, and the generated gas, after further heating, will be sent into the lead tanks."



"Are all these devices made of lead?"

"That's right, only lead can resist the corrosion of acid," Kyle nodded. "The lead pipe at the top of the jar continuously sprinkles nitric and sulfuric acid. Under the scorching sulfur dioxide gas, nitric acid is thermally decomposed into nitrogen oxides, which finally react with water and sulfur dioxide to form a sulfuric acid solution, flowing out from the hole at the bottom—The clever part of this reaction is that the nitrogen oxides only serve to transfer oxygen without being consumed, so the amount of nitric acid required is not large. Once the reaction starts, it can continue indefinitely!"



"What's its production like?" Roland excitedly patted the lead jar. Mass production of acid was a prerequisite for the mass production of smokeless powder, and if this problem could be solved, ammunition for the new generation of repeating rifles and cannons would be hopeful.



"This is the fourth device I've experimented with, and its daily output is roughly equivalent to a week's worth of quantity produced by dry distillation in the laboratory," the Chief Alchemist said proudly. "Due to the experimental factors, its size is not large. If we could build larger lead jars, the production could be further increased."



"That's really good news," Roland laughed, "When Miss Anna returns, you should immediately start building a larger scale acid production device. Also, if we run out of lead, we could use iron instead, as Miss Soraya's coating can protect iron from acid corrosion."



Kyle nodded in agreement, but his next words froze the prince's smile on his face.



"Now that we have results from the large-scale acid production method, and all five laboratories are filled with apprentices, Your Highness, may I receive the 'Intermediate Chemistry' book you promised me?"
