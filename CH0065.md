## Ominous Signs
There had been several times before when the horn was sounded, mostly involving dozens of demonic beasts attacking the border one after another, and the militia had become proficient in dealing with them.

Therefore, Roland was not panicked. He announced the suspension of the training, allowing Wendy and Lightning to return to the castle to rest, while Anna was to protect Nana and head to the medical tent to wait for the injured. He himself went with Nightingale to the city wall.

Unexpectedly, Lightning protested, "As an explorer, having been in the Western Region of the continent for so long, I have never witnessed a large-scale demonic beast attack with my own eyes. It's simply a shame to my identity. I request to go with you!"

Roland rejected her protest without hesitation and instructed Wendy to keep a close eye on Lightning, strictly forbidding her from running around during the demonic beast rampage.

He then looked at Nightingale, who nodded, stepped forward to grab Roland's hand, and stepped into the Mist, heading straight for the city wall—ever since learning that Nightingale could bring anything she touched into the Mist with her, Roland had immediately become fascinated with this mode of travel. It allowed them to pass through obstacles, ignore terrain, and cover several meters in a single step, giving him a thrilling sense of freedom in the confines of space.

Arriving at the base of the city wall, Roland found a secluded corner to step out of the Mist and walked alone onto the defensive line. The fields in the distance were a blanket of white, and he did not see the scene of a large-scale demonic beast assault. Was this a false alarm? He was not the only one to think this; murmurs rose among the militia members who had taken their positions in succession.

The prince found Iron Axe, but saw that he was staring solemnly into the distance, the horn still gripped tightly in his hand.

"Did you sound the alarm?"

"Yes, Your Highness, look..." his voice was much drier than usual, "That guy has come."



That guy? Roland gazed into the distance, only to see a faint black dot at the edge of his vision, which was hard to spot even against the pure white background. According to regulations, the assembly horn should only be sounded when it is determined that the patrol team cannot handle the situation. But Iron Axe, as an experienced hunter, must have his reasons.



"It's a mixed breed," he swallowed, "the same one I encountered six years ago."



Is that so? Roland frowned. In theory, demonic beasts should all die during their assault on Longsong Stronghold—they lack intelligence and the concept of retreat does not exist in their brains. The stronghold has never been breached, but it survived and lived for another six years? A foreboding feeling rose within him.



At such a distance, he could only vaguely see a black dot, yet Iron Axe could clearly distinguish the type of demonic beast. His eyesight was astonishing. Perhaps, he was mistaken, the prince thought.



The demonic beast did not make Roland wait too long; it began to approach the city walls, and soon everyone noticed this uniquely shaped target.



It wasn't as massive as the previous mixed breed. At first glance, it looked like an enlarged feline, but it had a pair of fleshy wings on its back, which were folded and covered its sides when not spread. Its head was similar to a lion's but had two pairs of eyes—if the additional pair wasn't just for show, it could capture movements in a large area behind it without turning its head.



Carter and several hunters had already loaded their ammunition, ready for battle.



However, the lion-type mixed breed did not charge directly. It stopped just outside the range of the bows and crossbows, looking around.



This distance was within the effective range of the flintlock guns, but the likelihood of a first-shot hit was almost zero.



Not long after, it suddenly leaped to the left, spreading its wings, allowing its massive body to take flight. Just as Iron Axe had said, it could perform short-distance flights or glides. After flipping over the barrier, the hybrid demonic beast swiftly ran toward the unguarded section of the city wall on the western end.



Roland’s heart skipped a beat, his ominous premonition coming true. The ability to observe an opponent’s strengths and weaknesses and choose to strike at the weakest point was a clear sign of intelligence—something that beasts lacked. They might occasionally attack the weak points of their prey, but that was the result of millions of years of instinct passed down through generations. Faced with an unknown opponent, they were utterly incapable of such judgment, let alone a comprehensive analysis of multiple targets.



What did possessing intelligence mean? Humans, with their superior brains and outstanding endurance, had walked from the grasslands where they consumed raw meat and blood to the very top of the food chain. Roland dared not ponder further. He waved his hand, signaling the Chief Knight to follow him, while the other hunters followed Iron Axe to snipe the demonic beast.



After reaching the unguarded section, it leaped straight up, effortlessly climbing over the city wall, and then ran toward the residential area, completely ignoring the hunter team.



"Damn beast!" Roland cursed loudly, "Militia of the second wall section, come with me. The reserves take over, temporarily guard the wall!"



By now, he could no longer care that the militia had only been trained in stationary thrusting and that moving might lead to the team falling apart and being attacked separately by the demonic beast. Carter also led the guards, following the prince closely. Their individual combat strength was the strongest, ready to fill any gaps that might arise. Bringing up the rear was the team with the matchlock guns, led by Iron Axe.



After entering the old district, their line of sight was blocked by the bungalows, and the narrow roads covered in snow greatly limited their movement. Roland dared not split up his troops to search; they could only move through the crisscrossed alleys, hoping to catch sight of the demonic beast.



He regretted not bringing Lightning along. If they had a witch to scout from the air, they wouldn't be scurrying around like headless flies.



After searching for about a quarter of an hour, a sudden scream from the townspeople came from deep within the alleyways.



The team immediately changed direction and rushed towards the source of the sound. Thanks to the fact that most of the militia were residents of the old district, they skillfully crossed through alleyways, even wading through the backyards of other people's homes. Upon arriving at the scene, Roland saw a man bitten in half, his viscera scattered all over the ground, clearly already dead.



"My God... it's Iron Fork, I know him!"



"Damn it, did it escape?"



"Watch out! Look to the right!" someone suddenly shouted. Before the words were finished, a dark shadow burst out from a wooden house on the right, accompanied by flying wooden debris. It smashed through the wall of the wooden house and pounced into the unsuspecting team. Its front paw knocked down a militiaman and bit down.



Iron Axe was the first to react. He wanted to raise his gun to shoot, but realized that the scattered militia were blocking the alley, leaving him no suitable opportunity to fire. He had to push through the crowd, moving step by step towards the target. Other hunters also encountered the same problem; they tucked their guns under their armpits, leapt up to grasp the eaves, and climbed onto the rooftops in two or three moves.



The hybrid creature, facing the thrust of the long spears, was undisturbed. It spread its wings to block the frantic stabs. Just as it picked up the bloodied militiaman with its mouth, preparing to leap away, a gunshot sounded.



Several black blossoms of blood burst from the beast.



The hybrid, struck by the lead shot, roared in anger. It threw away the prey in its mouth and spread its wings to pounce towards the hunters on the rooftop. Iron Axe had just squeezed through the crowd, and he quickly raised his gun in front of the demonic beast and pulled the trigger.



The point-blank shot left no possibility of missing; the gunpowder gas even sprayed onto the creature's nose. The bullet, without losing velocity, went straight through the target's eye and into its skull.



The hybrid demonic beast stiffened all over and toppled to the ground.
