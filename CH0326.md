"Is this where you landed last time?" Tilly asked as she gazed at the towering cliff in front of them.

The Seagull had been sailing westward along the coast since they had sighted land until they came upon this beachhead, at which point Ashes called for the ship to stop.

"Mhm, look." She pointed towards the top of the mountain range.

Following her direction, Tilly saw two orange flags fluttering in the wind.

"Although it was a beach the last time we came here, those two flags mean we haven't gone off course."

"I remember as well," Old Jack said, holding his pipe, "but last time they had a huge balloon to transport all the witches over the cliff. How do you plan to get across?"

"A huge balloon?" Tilly asked curiously.

"Yes, it can fly when filled with hot air," Ashes nodded, "It's said to be an invention of Prince Roland. The principle is to use the lifting power of hot air to carry the balloon and people into the sky."

Princess Tilly's expression became a bit complex for a moment. "The court tutor never taught us about these things." Then she exhaled a breath of white air, "Anyway, we'll be seeing him soon, and then we will naturally know the outcome. Let's go ashore."



"Are you sure you don't want to wait for him on the ship?" the captain flicked off the ash from his cigarette. "What about this cliff then?"



"Just leave it to Ashes," Tilly said with a smile.



Since this was a naturally formed coast, no one knew the depth of the seabed, so the Pretty Woman dared not get too close. They could only send people to the shallows by launching a small boat.



After stepping onto the thick snow, Tilly looked at Jack One-Eye, "Captain, would you please wait here for three or four days? Lotus and the others will still need your help to return to Sleeping Island."



"Of course," the captain replied. "Without you all on the ship, I wouldn't dare to return the same way. Who knows if those mutated water ghosts will come back again."



Tilly walked to the edge of the cliff, using the power of the magic stone to fly directly to the top of the mountain, surveying the surroundings—the terrain behind the mountain was much higher than the shallows, almost level with the mountain top, meaning they only needed to ascend, not descend. The height of the cliff was about fifty steps. The barrier used more magical power when lifting objects, but such a distance shouldn't be difficult for Ashes. She slowly descended back to the group, "Ashes, I'll leave these three to you."



"Yes, Lady Tilly," the latter said with a smile, patting her chest. She then summoned an invisible barrier—having rested for two days, she had recovered from the fierce collision with the sea monster. Once everyone stepped onto the transparent barrier, she drove her magic power, making it rise slowly upwards, and soon they were over the top of the mountain.



Then, guided by Ashes, the group spent half a day and finally arrived at Border Town.



The first thing that caught Tilly's eye was a uniquely shaped steel bridge. It spanned across a wide river, with only two piers at the bottom. Aside from the neatly arranged steel beams and columns, there was no superfluous decoration or pattern. The contrast between the snow covering the bridge and the exposed black structure of the bridge was striking, exuding an indescribable presence.



"This bridge... it's really huge," Gentle Breeze exclaimed, "How many iron ingots did they melt down to build such a bridge?"

"It's such a waste of materials. A simple pontoon bridge would have solved the crossing problem. Why build it so high?" Ashes scoffed, "Border Town is already the last stop for the merchant fleet. Are there really any ships that want to do business upriver at its source?"

"That's a narrow-minded view," Andrea said elegantly, waving her index finger, "Even though I'm not from Greycastle, I can see that the forest to the west has great potential for development. The absence of a town now doesn't mean there won't be one in the future. Expanding into unclaimed territory is an excellent choice. When that time comes, a pontoon bridge would be an obstacle to river transport, Lady Tilly's brother is clearly thinking further ahead than you."

Ashes raised an eyebrow, "Just a moment ago you were calling him a vulgar noble who enjoyed barbaric cooking, and now you've changed your tune to Lady Tilly's brother?"

"The term 'vulgar noble' was your addition," the blonde witch replied disdainfully, turning her head away, "Moreover, having foresight doesn't conflict with barbaric cooking, so there's no need for you to stir up trouble in front of Lady Tilly."

Lady Tilly paid no attention to their routine argument, instead focusing her gaze on the opposite bank of the river.

She noticed an incredible phenomenon.

Snow was still falling from the sky, and the temperature was no different from the dead of winter. Normally, townspeople should be hiding in their homes, either huddled around a stove or curled up under blankets. Even in the capital, one would hardly see people on the streets in winter— the severe cold accelerated the loss of physical strength. To keep warm, one had to eat more than usual, not to mention the risk of catching a cold if one went outside. Therefore, aside from essential eating and drinking, the majority of commoners would avoid going out in winter.

However, there was a constant flow of people along the riverbank of the town—they were pushing carts, carrying large bags, and walking briskly, looking as though they were busy working. Lady Tilly didn't see any overseers with whips by their side, which meant that these people were working voluntarily.



How could this be possible?

After crossing the iron bridge, two guards wielding peculiar long guns approached them. They were dressed in uniform, looking energetic and their demeanor was entirely different from the patrol teams commonly seen in large cities. "Halt, why have you come from the south?" one of them scrutinized them for a moment, "Wait, are you... witches?"

This question made Tilly slightly stunned. Although she had long known about the existence of witches being made public in this town, she still felt a wave of emotion when she personally heard an ordinary person ask this question in such a calm tone. "Yes, we are witches."

"You're here to join the Witch Union, right?" the guard smiled, "Please wait here, I will report to my superiors immediately."

"Wait? No, this person is—"

"It's okay, we'll wait here." Tilly interrupted Ashes with her hand, "Besides, may I ask what these people are busy with?"

"Ah, they are rushing to repair the dock, because the heavy snow came so suddenly, a lot of things have become chaotic. As for the specifics of what needs to be done, I'm not too sure."

After the guard returned to his post, Ashes asked in confusion, "Why didn't you tell them your identity?"

"Don't you find it curious? How he would react to a witch from another city." Tilly playfully winked.



Before long, a tall woman clad in a white gown approached them—she had long, golden curly hair and a flawless visage. Even without seeing her magic, Tilly could feel the sharp aura emanating from her, like a drawn blade.



There was no doubt that the newcomer was a combat witch, and an exceedingly powerful one at that.



"I really thought a new witch wanted to join the Witch Union, didn't you go back to Sleeping Island?" She glanced at Ashes and then swept her gaze over the others. When her eyes landed on Tilly, she paused abruptly, and in that instant, the sharpness vanished, replaced by a warmth like that of water.



"Hello, I am Nightingale," she said with a nod, "You must be Tilly Wimbledon, Prince Roland's sister, right?"
