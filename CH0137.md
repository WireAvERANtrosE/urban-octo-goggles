## Confidential Talk
Pushing open the thick wooden door of the secret chamber, a faint scent of rest-grass wafted to meet him. Archbishop Mayne was very fond of this kind of candle mixed with herbs and spices, especially in a closed space without windows, where the scent it emitted could make him feel serene.



The chamber was not large, only big enough to accommodate a round table and four chairs. The other two archbishops were already seated in their spots, while the seat opposite the door remained empty. The Pope's health was deteriorating, and he had not appeared before them for almost half a year. Mayne would only go to the Hermes Secret Area of the church to seek answers from the Pope himself when confronted with difficult problems.



"If everyone is present, let's begin," Mayne said as he bolted the door and sat down between the two, "Lord Tavore, how is the order in the Kingdom of Everwinter being maintained?"



"Besides the nobles in the royal capital, resistance in other places is minimal, and the commoners even welcome our takeover of the kingdom," Tavore stroked his beard, "Of course, those nobles who cling to past glories and are stubbornly delusional will be eliminated one by one."



"That's good," Heather licked her lips, "If it were up to me to judge them, the people would realize even more deeply their ugly and filthy side. It's a pity I have a lot to attend to here and can't go to the Everwinter King's City."



Mayne simply ignored her comment and said to Tavore, "Those vacancies, we need to fill them with our people as soon as possible. The church has cultivated a large number of talents for this purpose, and now is the time to use them. Everwinter has always been the kingdom most influenced by the church; the smaller the ripples we cause, the sooner we can free up our hands to deal with Wolfheart and Dawn."



"Of course."



"What about those fence-sitters who have turned to the churchâ€”I mean the nobles?" Heather asked, "The church has attracted so many excellent believers because we do not care about lineage, only ability. If we rashly accept those fools, it could shake the foundation of the church. My suggestion is..." She made a throat-cutting gesture.



"Leave them be for now, and make it clear to them once the situation in the kingdom is stable. This can reduce the resistance to change." Mayne specifically sought the Pope's advice on this matter, "The church can offer them positions of authority equivalent to their titles, but they may not pass them on to their descendants. Don't forget that ultimately, we aim to eliminate the monarchy, so there is no need to rush, Archbishop Heather."



Heather came from a poor background, suffering from hunger and wandering before being taken in by the Church. Yet, with her innate sharp wits and exceptional judgment, she had climbed her way up to her current position step by step. Mayne could understand her disdain for nobility, but at times like this, the bigger picture had to take precedence.



"How is the situation over in Greycastle?" he asked.



"According to intelligence, the new king, Timothy, did not return to the royal capital after his defeat; instead, he went directly to the Eastern Region," Tavol replied.



"A smart choice," Heather snapped her fingers, "Dragging Duke Flandre to challenge Queen Clearwater, and after the duke's death, immediately going to the Eastern Region to divide his territory to stabilize the army's morale, while casually winning over other nobles... Tsk, not all in the royal family are fools."



"In doing so, we can also save ourselves a lot of trouble. Let the Archbishop of the Greycastle Cathedral contact him. In this predicament, he will not refuse the bait thrown by the Church. Reduce the drug supply to Clearwater Harbor by another thirty percent to balance the power between the two. This task is yours, Lord Tavol," Mayne arranged, "As long as another two years pass, the whole of Greycastle will have no soldiers left to use."



"Rest assured," Tavol nodded, "But... there's been a little problem with Longsong Stronghold to the west of Greycastle."



"What problem?"



"Fourth Prince Roland, after defeating Duke Lion, has returned to Border Town. Even the invitation personally sent by Thylo has been ignored. Does he really have no interest in vying for the throne?"



"Hmm... What do you think?" Mayne looked towards Heather.



The latter shrugged and said, "What else could it be... What were the initial rumors about him? Uneducated, ill-tempered, incompetent, greedy. I don't think such a person could possibly take down Longsong Stronghold, right? So the answer is simple, he has deceived everyone, whether it be the nobles or us."

"You mean..." Mayne furrowed his brows.

"Our selection for the King's Quest chose the wrong character, Lord Mayne," she sneered, "He is the one who should be stepping onto the stage, not the Third Princess Grace."

"Defeating a duke indeed proves his remarkable ability, but no matter how talented a person is, it's meaningless without sufficient resources to utilize," Tavlen shook his head, "Since he chose to return to that desolate land, it means he has given up the possibility of meddling in Greycastle's affairs, and naturally, he won't pose any threat to our plans."

"Correct, theoretically that is. However, it becomes quite interesting when you combine it with this piece of intelligence," Hester tossed over a small piece of paper, "My personal intelligence."

Mayne unfolded the paper and quickly scanned the content, "Witches?"

"Mm-hmm, a witch organization that calls itself the Witch Cooperation Association, claiming to have established a foothold in Border Town and calling other sisters to join them. Although these are all unsubstantiated rumors, we shouldn't be discussing them here, but as we all know, the name Witch Cooperation Association is not made up. Ever since they were hunted by the Judgement Army in the eastern forests, they have been fleeing westward and ultimately disappeared to the west of Longsong Stronghold. And Border Town happens to be outside the western border of Greycastle, at the foot of the Impassable Mountain Range. My lords, isn't this coincidence a bit too much?"



The Witch Cooperation Association... Mayne still had some impression of the name, being relentlessly pursued and blocked by the Judgement Army, they lost quite a few members but still insisted on moving towards the Impassable Mountain Range. The interrogation of the captured witches revealed that they seemed to be looking for a holy mountain in the barbaric lands. This was an act of seeking death, so he did not invest more effort into this matter. There were several other witch organizations like this in Wolfheart and the Dawn Kingdom, lurking within cities which were far more threatening than heading to the barbaric lands to die.



"Are you suggesting that this prince has colluded with the witch organization?" Tavlen's face darkened after reading the message.



"Perhaps there is, perhaps there isn't," Heather raised the corner of her mouth, "I'm just making a simple guess. What are witches most afraid of? 'Exposing themselves.' Obviously, using the name Witch Union is more likely to attract the attention of the Church, but they still use this name in the underground information, why?"



"Because for us, it's a familiar name," Mayne said calmly, "The same is true for other witches."



"Full marks!" Heather clapped her hands twice, "This can effectively lower the guard of rogue witches, and maybe some will be attracted by this message and set out to Border Town to see for themselves. It's hard to imagine that without the protection of a lord, they would dare to play such a hand. We often say, choose the lesser of two evils. Clearly, the other party has already concluded that the consequences of not attracting witches are more severe than those of being exposed..." She spoke in a more ominous tone, "How do I feel like we are being underestimated."



"It's not a matter of being underestimated at all," Tefren said angrily, "Once witches have a place to settle down, they can use their abilities without worry, and it is very likely that they will discover that the so-called demonic devouring of the body can be avoided. That's why we must hunt down any settled witches, only by forcing them to constantly hide, flee, and be in exile can this secret be maintained."



Mayne knew that the other was right, witches themselves did not pose much of a threat to the Church, but as a group, once they shed their identity as 'evil beings,' they could greatly influence the Church's propaganda and even shake the foundation of the Church's rule.



He found himself in a dilemma. In such situations, a large number of Judgment Army troops should be dispatched to hunt them down, but Border Town was simply too far from Hermes, and the Church's army was about to launch an attack on the Kingdom of Wolfheart, making it difficult to spare troops to exterminate this remote town. Moreover, at this critical juncture, sending a large number of troops into Greycastle would inevitably alert Greycastle and the other two countries, possibly affecting subsequent annexation plans.



After much thought, he made a decision.



"I will send a mission consisting of ten members of the Judgment Army and one priest to Border Town, to investigate the matter with the assistance of High Priest Thylo. If the Witch Union's actions are unrelated to the lord, this mission can eliminate the witches on their own."



"What if they are related?" Heather asked.



The God's Punishment Army cannot be led by anyone other than himself and a few trusted confidants; this was a rule personally established by the Pope. With this in mind, Mayne spoke word by word, "Send the message back to the Holy City, I will personally lead the God's Punishment Army there."
