## Private Conversation
Pushing open the heavy wooden door of the secret meeting room, a faint scent of peacebloom greeted him, Archbishop Mayne was very fond of these candles mixed with herbs and spices, especially in a closed space without windows, their fragrance could calm his mind.



The chamber was small, only big enough to accommodate a round table and four chairs. The other two archbishops were already seated in their places, and the seat directly facing the door remained empty. The Pope's health was deteriorating, and he had not appeared before them for almost half a year. Mayne only went to the Hermes secret area of the Church to seek answers from the Pope when faced with difficult problems.



"Now that we are all here, let's begin," Mayne closed the door and sat between the two, "Lord Tavolin, how is the order maintained in the Kingdom of Everwinter?"



"Except for the nobles in the capital, the resistance elsewhere is minimal, and commoners even welcome our takeover of the kingdom," stroked his beard, Tavolin said, "Of course, those nobles clinging to their past glory and refusing to see reason will be eradicated one by one."



"That's good," said Heather, licking her lips, "if they were left to me for judgment, the people would realize more deeply their ugly and filthy side. It's a pity I have many matters to attend to here and can't go to the Everwinter City."



Mayne ignored her comment and said to Tavolin, "Those vacant positions must be filled by our people as soon as possible. The Church has trained a large number of talents for this purpose, and now is the time to use them. Everwinter was the kingdom most influenced by the Church, the smaller the ripples we cause, the sooner we can free our hands to deal with Wolfheart and Dawn."



"Of course," he replied.



"What about those fence-sitting nobles—who I mean turned to the Church?" asked Heather, "The Church has attracted so many excellent believers because we do not care about lineage, only ability. Hastily accepting those fools could shake the Church's foundation. My suggestion is..." She made a throat-cutting gesture.



"Leave them be for now, and clarify things with them once the kingdom's situation is stable. This can reduce the resistance to change," Mayne said, having consulted the Pope on this matter, "The Church can provide them with positions equivalent to their noble titles but must not be inherited by their descendants. Don't forget that we are ultimately going to eliminate the monarchy. There is no need to rush, Archbishop Heather."



Heather was born into poverty, and she suffered from hunger and homelessness before being taken in by the Church. However, with her natural sharp wits and exceptional judgment, she managed to climb her way to her current position. Maine could understand her disdain for nobility, but at times like these, the bigger picture had to be prioritized.



"How is the situation in Greycastle?" he asked.



"According to intelligence, the new king, Timothy, did not return to the royal capital after his defeat but went straight to the Eastern Region," Tavol replied.



"A smart choice," Heather snapped her fingers, "Dragging Duke Ryan to challenge Queen Clearwater, and after the duke's death, he immediately went to the Eastern Region to divide his territories to stabilize the morale of his troops, while at the same time pulling in other nobles... not all fools in the royal family, huh."



"This way, we can also save ourselves a lot of trouble. Let the Archpriest of the Greycastle royal capital church contact him. In such a predicament, he won't reject the bait thrown by the Church. Reduce the supply of medicine to Clearwater Harbor by another thirty percent to balance the power between the two. Leave this to you, Lord Tavol," Maine arranged, "In just two more years, the entire Greycastle will have no soldiers to use."



"Don't worry," Tavol nodded, "But... there's been a problem with the Longsong Stronghold to the west of Greycastle."



"What problem?"



"After defeating Duke Ryan, the fourth prince, Roland, returned to Border Town. Even the invitation sent personally by Tyro did not get any response. Does he really have no interest in competing for the throne?"



"Hmm... What do you think?" Maine looked at Heather.



The latter shrugged and said, "What can I say... What were the initial rumors about him? Uneducated, bad-tempered, incompetent, greedy. I don't think such a person could possibly take down the Longsong Stronghold, right? So the answer is simple, he deceived everyone, whether it be the nobles or us."

"You mean..." Maine furrowed his brows.

"Our struggle for the throne picked the wrong character, Lord Maine," she sneered, "He is the one who should be on the stage, not Princess Grace."

"Defeating a duke indeed proves his exceptional ability, but no matter how talented a person is, without sufficient resources to utilize, it's meaningless," Tefren shook his head, "Since he chose to return to that remote land, it means he has given up the possibility of meddling in the situation of Greycastle, and naturally, he won't pose any threat to our plans."

"That's true, in theory. But it gets interesting when you combine it with this piece of intelligence," Heather threw out a small piece of paper, "My private intelligence."

Maine spread out the paper and quickly scanned the contents, "Witches?"

"Mhm, a witch organization that calls themselves the Mutual Aid Society claims to have secured a foothold in Border Town and are calling other sisters to join them. Although these are all elusive rumors that shouldn't be discussed here, we all know that the name Mutual Aid Society is not fictitious. Ever since they were hunted by the Church's Judgement Army in the Eastern Region's forest, they have been fleeing westward and eventually disappeared to the west of the Longsong Stronghold. And Border Town is located just outside the western border of Greycastle, at the foot of the Impassable Mountain Range. Lords, don't you think this is a little too coincidental?"

Mutual Aid Society... Maine had some recollection of the name, being persistently pursued and blocked by the Judgement Army, they still insisted on moving towards the Impassable Mountain Range even after suffering heavy losses. From the interrogation of the captured witches, it was known that they seemed to be looking for the Holy Mountain in the wilderness. This was an act of seeking death, hence he did not invest more effort into this matter. Similar witch organizations were more threatening hidden within the cities of Wolfheart and the Kingdom of Dawn than heading to the wasteland to court death.

"Are you suggesting that this prince has colluded with the witch organization?" Tefren's face darkened after reading the message.



"Maybe, maybe not," Heather curled her lips, "I'm just making a simple guess. What are witches most afraid of? 'Exposing themselves.' Obviously, using the name 'Witch Cooperation Association' would attract more attention from the Church, but they still used this name in the underground news. Why?"



"Because for us, it's a familiar name," Maine said calmly, "And the same goes for other witches."



"Full marks!" Heather clapped her hands twice, "Doing so can effectively lower the guard of the rogue witches. Maybe some will really be attracted by this message and set out to Border Town to find out the truth. It's hard to imagine that without the protection of a lord, they would dare to take such a risk. We often say, choose the lesser of two evils. Apparently, they have concluded that the consequences of not attracting witches are more severe than being exposed..." Her tone turned sinister, "Why do I feel like we are being underestimated?"



"It's not about being underestimated at all," Tefren said angrily, "Once witches have a place to settle down, they can use their abilities without worry, and they might discover that the so-called 'Devil's devouring' can be avoided. That's why we must hunt down any settled witches. Only by forcing them to constantly hide, flee, and be exiled can this secret be maintained."



Maine knew he was right. Witches themselves did not pose much of a threat to the Church, but as a group, once they shed their identity as 'evildoers,' they could greatly impact the Church’s propaganda and even shake the foundations of the Church's rule.



He found himself in a dilemma. Normally, such a situation would call for a large number of the Judgement Army to hunt them down, but Border Town was too far from Hermes, and the Church's army was about to launch an attack on the Kingdom of Wolfheart. It was difficult to spare the manpower to eradicate this remote town. Moreover, at this critical juncture, sending a large force into Greycastle would certainly alert Greycastle and the other two countries, potentially affecting the subsequent annexation plans.



After much consideration, he made a decision.



"I will send an envoy of ten members of the Judgement Army and a priest to Border Town to investigate this matter with the assistance of Archbishop Tayro. If the Witch Cooperation Association's activities are unrelated to the lord, this envoy can eradicate the witches on their own."



"And if they are related?" Heather asked.



The God's Punishment Army cannot be led by anyone other than myself and a few trusted confidants; this is a rule personally established by the Pope. With this in mind, Mayne spoke word by word, "Send the message back to the Holy City. I will personally lead the God's Punishment Army there."
