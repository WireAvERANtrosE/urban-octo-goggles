## Ferocious Scar
However, when Roland started operating it himself, he found that the actual situation was far from as simple as he had imagined. He had been busy in the backyard for four or five days, and the hard drill bit was successfully made. With Anna's high-temperature flame, he could easily obtain molten iron above 1500 degrees. Without the limitation of temperature, small batches of steel could be produced quickly and conveniently using conventional steel frying methods - stirring the molten iron with an iron rod to allow the excess carbon and other impurities in the pig iron to fully oxidize with the air. After several repetitions, the molten iron cools down to obtain high-quality steel.
The problem lies with the Steam Engine No.1.
When this prototype was working, the noise and vibration were both astonishing, causing the drill bit to be unable to stably drill a complete iron pipe. When doing heavy work, such a level of shaking is irrelevant, but it is obviously not feasible for processing gun barrels. 
In order to improve this, he would have to first create a centrifugal governor to control the output power of the steam engine, then use a gear combination to reduce the shaking and adjust the rotation speed of the drill bit. And processing gears requires a simple lathe. Calculating this way, Roland found that he simply couldn't achieve this goal before Evil Months.
In the end, he could only use the old method of relying on the blacksmith's hands to hammer it out one by one. The plan for mass production of firearms failed. According to the number of blacksmith shops in Border Town, at most 3-4 gun barrels could be produced in a month, and this was also the case when the construction of the second steam engine was halted.
The only good news was that he didn't have to worry about the pass rate of gun barrels. The blacksmith just needed to hammer out a rough round tube, and then Anna would uniformly seal it. The effect was close to the seamless pipe cut out by the boring cutter, which basically eliminated the risk of exploding the barrel.
In desperation, Roland had to modify his previous plan. He originally planned to recruit hunters from Border Town to form a musket team - most of them were proficient in archery, and both bows and crossbows were their handy weapons. In addition to the short firearms training time, they could quickly become combat ready.
But now, at most four flintlock guns could be produced before the Evil Months, so he could only select the most outstanding people among the hunters to form an elite group. Roland decided to leave this matter to Iron Axe. He had been in Border Town for fifteen years and was also recognized as the best hunter.

...
Brian had not been happy for the past half a month.
Especially when he encountered the militia on the street, his unhappiness would intensify... even with a hint of resentment in his heart.
He felt that he had been forgotten by the prince.
A month ago, when he was called over by the Chief Knight, he was thrilled. To be in close contact with the Fourth Prince, to be personally asked by His Highness, what an incredible honor and privilege it was.
He had grown up in Border Town, and although he came from a simple hunter's family, he had become the patrol captain on his own merit. He knew he couldn't rely on his family's status to become a knight, he could only wait for a chance to distinguish himself and be recognized by those in power.
The question from His Highness made him feel that his opportunity had come. Clearly, the Fourth Prince, Roland, did not want to give up his territory; he was trying to find a way to fight against the demonic beasts. The massive construction of the city wall also proved one point: undoubtedly, they would spend Evil Months in Border Town this year.
To resist the invasion of the demonic beasts here, a team that dared to fight head-on must be formed. Brian initially thought he was the best candidate; he was adept at scouting, swordsmanship, and horsemanship. Every year, he stayed until the last moment to light the beacon, proving his courage. But he never expected that the prince planned to select a team from the civilians to fight against the demonic beasts!
Yes, a pure civilian team. Not just him, none of the ten members of the patrol team passed the Chief Knight's review. This was simply unthinkable. Could it be that His Highness thought that these people, who had never held a sword, would be better at fighting than him? They would probably crumble at the sight of the ferocious demonic beasts!

But His Highness seemed to be serious... Not only was he training this motley crew, but he also provided them with uniform clothing. Every afternoon, Brian could see these people wearing brown and gray leather armor, running in two columns down the street. At the beginning, the team was scattered, but recently it has become more and more orderly.
And he, still executing tedious tasks every day, saw no hope of promotion.
At night, when he tossed and turned and couldn't sleep, a noise came from next door. Then the door was pushed open, and someone quietly walked in.
"Hey, everyone get up." The newcomer whispered. Brian recognized the voice, it was a member of the patrol team, a fellow nicknamed Scarface.
There were five people sleeping in his room, apart from him and Greyhound, the other three quickly got up, as if they were prepared, they didn't even take off their coats.
"Captain, get up quickly, I have something important to tell you."
Scarface had a noble relative in Longsong Stronghold, who was said to be a very important noble, so his status in the team was high. Brian couldn't ignore him, so he had to get up and ask, "What's the matter?"
Greyhound was also awakened, "This... it's so late, you... you guys are not going... to sleep?"
"I have a good opportunity to introduce to you guys, do you want to be knighted?"

"What...what? A knight?" Grayhound said in surprise.
Brian's heart also jumped, he hurriedly asked, "What exactly is the task?"
"You all know my Uncle Hilt, right? He's a count enfeoffed by the duke, and also a confidant of his. This message was personally handed down by him," Ferocious Scar said in a low voice, "The Fourth Prince is preparing to go it alone, leaving Longsong Stronghold behind, which has greatly displeased the duke. He's decided to let the prince know who the real master of the Western Territory is."
"Are...are...are you planning...to assassinate..." Grayhound stuttered even more when he was nervous, unable to finish a simple sentence.
"Impossible," Ferocious Scar scoffed, "No matter what, he's still a prince. If he dies, even the duke won't be able to protect us. Like I said, this is a good job."
Brian subconsciously felt that this deal was definitely not as simple as he claimed, but the temptation of being knighted was too great, he couldn't help but ask, "Let's hear it."
"Food. Without food, he can only obediently roll back to Longsong Stronghold. This task is promised by the duke. As long as we can successfully burn the food bought by the Fourth Prince, he will hold a knighting ceremony for us, and also grant us a piece of land on the east side of the stronghold. This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, Captain, what do you think?"
"Are...are you mad...didn't, didn't His Highness say, this year... the Evil Months might last... last for more than four months, if you burn, burn the food, what will everyone eat!" Grayhound shook his head, "Have...have you all forgotten what happened two years ago?"
"What's it to us?" another man said disdainfully, "Anyway, I'm not planning to stay here. Once we've done Lord Ryan's task, we can live a comfortable life in the stronghold."

"Exactly, do you all really want to eat ore slag for the rest of your lives in this damned place?" The others echoed in agreement. 
Damn it, they've all been in cahoots from the start. Bret felt a chill in his heart. Apart from him and Greyhound, who grew up in Border Town, most of them came from all over the kingdom with no attachments to the small town. Seeing that he was powerless to stop them, he had no choice but to change the subject. "But all the wheat has been moved to His Highness's castle, and the entrance is guarded by his personal knights. How can you possibly get in?"
"That's why I need you," Scarface said with a triumphant grin. "You've been here since you were a kid, nobody knows the area better than you do. I remember you once said that there's an abandoned well in the gully behind the mountain, which connects to the castle's waterway. Through it, you can silently reach the castle garden. Didn't you crawl in there when you were a kid? What do you say, if you join me on this, you could become a knight too â€” a knight personally knighted by the Duke himself."
No... a knight should be brave in fighting against injustice, should not fear power, and should protect the weak! To disregard the residents of the small town, placing them under the threat of hunger and death, all just for the Duke's personal grudge? What honor is there to speak of for such a knight, other than an empty shell?
He was about to refuse when Greyhound shouted out.
"A... a bunch of madmen! You... you... dare to steal the food, I won't... won't let you leave this... place! I will report... report to... ahem." Greyhound's voice suddenly halted mid-sentence. He turned around in disbelief, a former teammate was standing behind him, sneering. A black dagger was thrust into Greyhound's back, its blade completely disappearing into his body. He shivered, opened his mouth to say something, but could only make a hoarse gasping sound.
The man twisted the dagger twice, then yanked it out forcefully. Greyhound immediately collapsed to the ground, limp and lifeless like a rag doll.
"What do you think?" Scarface moved closer to Bret, who could even smell the foul breath from his mouth. "I think you should have made your decision by now, Captain?"
