## Scarface
However, Roland realized that the actual situation was far more complicated than he had thought when he began working on it himself.



After toiling in the backyard for four or five days, he managed to produce a drill bit with satisfactory hardness. Utilizing Anna's high-temperature flame, he could easily obtain molten iron at temperatures above fifteen hundred degrees. Without the constraint of temperature, producing small batches of steel became convenient and quick through the conventional puddling method—rapidly stirring the molten iron with an iron rod to allow the excess carbon and other impurities in the pig iron to fully oxidize in contact with the air. After repeating this process several times and letting the iron cool, high-quality steel could be obtained.



The problem lay with the Steam Engine prototype.



The noise and vibration when this prototype machine was operating were extremely alarming, resulting in an inability to steadily drill through an entire iron pipe with the drill bit. During rough and heavy work, such a degree of vibration was insignificant, but it was clearly unfeasible for machining gun barrels.



To improve this, he needed to first create a centrifugal governor to control the power output of the steam engine, then use a gear assembly to reduce the vibration and adjust the rotation speed of the drill bit. However, machining gears required a simple lathe. Considering all this, Roland realized that he had no way of achieving this goal before the Evil Months arrived.



In the end, he could only resort to the old method, relying on the blacksmith's hands to hammer out the shape. The plan for mass-producing firearms had failed. Given the number of blacksmith shops in Border Town, at most, they could produce 3-4 gun barrels in a month, and that was only if they stopped building the second steam engine.



The only good news was that he didn't have to worry about the quality of the gun barrels. The blacksmiths only needed to forge rough tubes, and then Anna could uniformly weld the seams. The result was close to a seamless tube produced by a boring tool, which essentially eliminated the risk of the barrel exploding.



With no choice, Roland had to alter his previous plan. He had initially intended to recruit hunters from Border Town to form a musket team—they were mostly proficient in archery and were skilled with both bows and crossbows. Additionally, firearm training would take a short time, enabling them to quickly become battle-ready.



But now, with the arrival of the Evil Months, at most four matchlock guns could be made, and thus he could only select the most outstanding individuals from among the hunters to form an elite group. Roland decided to entrust this task to Iron Axe, who had been living in Border Town for fifteen years and was widely recognized as the best hunter.



Brian has not been having a good half month.

Especially when encountering the militia on the streets, his unhappiness would double... He even felt a bit resentful deep down.

He felt that he had been forgotten by the Prince.

A month ago, when he was called over by the Chief Knight, he was full of excitement. To come into close contact with the Fourth Prince, to be personally questioned by His Highness, was such a fortunate and glorious event.

He grew up in Border Town, and although he came from an ordinary hunting family, he had leveraged his own abilities to take on the role of the captain of the patrol team. He knew he could not rely on his family name to become a knight and could only wait for an opportunity to achieve merits and receive a noble title from those above him.

The Prince's questioning made him feel that his chance had come. It was clear that the Fourth Prince, Roland, was unwilling to give up his domain and was trying to find a way to combat the demonic beasts. The subsequent construction of the town walls also proved one thing—without a doubt, they would spend the Evil Months in Border Town this year.

To stop the invasion of the demonic beasts here, it was necessary to form a team willing to confront them head-on. Brian had originally thought he was the perfect candidate; he was proficient in scouting, swordsmanship, and horsemanship, and every year he was one of the last to remain behind to light the beacon, proving his courage. However, he never expected that His Highness intended to select troops from among the commoners to fight the demonic beasts!

Yes, a purely commoner troops. Not just him, but none of the ten people in the patrol team passed the Chief Knight's review. It was simply inconceivable. Could it be that His Highness believed that these people, who had never wielded a sword, would be better at fighting than him? He feared that they would fall apart at the sight of the ferocious appearance of the demonic beasts!



But His Highness seemed serious... Not only was he training this rabble, but he also issued them uniforms. Every afternoon, Brian could see the group running in two columns down the street, wearing brown and gray leather armor. At first, the formation was loose, but recently it has become more orderly. 

As for himself, he was still carrying out the same monotonous tasks every day, with no hope of promotion in sight.

At night, when he tossed and turned in bed unable to sleep, a noise came from next door, followed by the door being pushed open, and someone quietly walked in.

"Hey, everyone up," the person whispered. Brian recognized the voice; it was a member of the patrol team, a guy nicknamed Scarface.

There were five people sleeping in his room, besides himself and Greyhound, the other three quickly got up, as if they were prepared, without even taking off their coats.

"Captain, get up, I have something important to tell you."

Scarface had a noble relative in the Longsong Stronghold, rumored to be a very important noble, which gave him a high status in the team, so Brian couldn't ignore him and had to get up and ask, "What's the matter?"

Greyhound was also woken up, "This... it's so late, you... you guys aren't sleeping?"

"I've got a good job to offer you, how would you like to be knighted?"



"What... What? A knight?" Greyhound said in surprise.

Brian's heart skipped a beat, and he quickly asked, "What exactly is the job?"

"You all know my uncle Luke, right? He's a count enfeoffed by His Grace and is also one of His Grace's confidants. This news was personally told to me by him," Scarface lowered his voice and said, "The Fourth Prince is planning to break away from Longsong Stronghold to act independently, which has displeased His Grace. He has decided to let the prince know who truly rules over the Western Territory."

"Is it... could it be... you plan to... assassinate..." Greyhound became more stuttered as he grew nervous, struggling to finish his sentence.

"How could that be," Scarface scoffed, "No matter what, he is still a prince. If he dies, even His Grace couldn't protect us. As I said, this is a good job."

Brian subconsciously felt that this deal was definitely not as simple as he claimed, but the temptation of being knighted was too great, and he couldn't help but say, "Let's hear it."

"Grain. Without grain, he can only obediently roll back to Longsong Stronghold. This job is promised by His Grace; as long as we succeed in burning the grain that the Fourth Prince has bought, he will hold a knighting ceremony for us and grant us a piece of fiefdom on the eastern side of the stronghold. This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, Captain, what do you think?"

"Are you... mad, His Highness had said that this year... the Evil Months are likely to last for more than four months, if you burn the grain, what will everyone eat!" Greyhound shook his head repeatedly, "Has everyone forgotten what happened two years ago?"

"What's that got to do with us?" another person said disdainfully, "Anyway, I wasn't planning on staying here. Once we've done His Grace's bidding, we can live a comfortable life in the stronghold."



"That's right, do you really want to eat slag in this godforsaken place for the rest of your lives?" The others chimed in to support him.



Damn it, they had colluded in advance. A chill ran down Brian's spine. Aside from himself and Grayhound who had grown up in Border Town, most of them came from various parts of the kingdom and had no attachment to the small town at all. Seeing that he couldn't stop them, he had to change the subject, "But all that wheat has been moved to His Highness's castle, with the prince's personal guards standing watch at the entrance. How could you possibly get in?"



"That's why I need you," Scarface said with a smug smile. "No one knows this crappy place better than you, having stayed here since you were a kid. I remember you said that there’s an abandoned well in the back mountain ravine that connects to the waterways under the castle. Through it, we can reach the castle garden without making a sound. Didn’t you crawl in there when you were a kid? How about it? Pull off this job with me, and you could also become a knight — knighted by the Duke himself."



No... A knight should fight against injustice, should not fear power, and protect the weak! Just for the Duke's personal grudge, to ignore the threat of hunger and death to the townspeople? What honor is there to be had in being a knight who is nothing but an empty shell!



He was just about to refuse when Grayhound started shouting.



"A bunch of madmen! You, you dare to covet the food, I absolutely, absolutely won't let you leave this place! I need to report to... cough." Grayhound's voice suddenly froze mid-sentence, and he turned around in disbelief to see a former comrade standing behind him, smirking. A black dagger was thrust into Grayhound from behind, the blade completely disappearing into his body. He trembled twice, opened his mouth to say something, but could only emit a hoarse gasp.



The attacker stirred the dagger twice, then yanked it out fiercely, and Grayhound collapsed to the ground like a deflated rag doll.



"How about it?" Scarface approached Brian, who could even feel the stench of blood on his breath, "I think you should have made up your mind by now, Captain?"
