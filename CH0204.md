## Tilly Wimbledon
The pair shared a tender moment before Ashes noticed a pile of gem-like trinkets placed in front of her and asked curiously, "What are these?"



"Come here," Tilly patted the space beside her, "I'll show you something interesting."



Ashes sat down cross-legged next to her and watched as she slipped on a white silk glove with a sparkling red gem embedded on the back of the hand.



"Is this... a tracking stone?"



Tilly didn't answer but smiled and stretched her hand towards the empty space. Suddenly, a bolt of lightning leaped from her fingertips, striking the ground with a crackling sound. A puff of blue smoke rose from the spot, leaving behind a palm-sized charred area.



Ashes could hardly believe her eyes. "You... you've acquired a new ability?"



Tilly Wimbledon was an extraordinary person whose magic worked on herself, manifesting as exceptional intelligence. It was impossible for her to release magic like a normal witch. The lightning just now signified that she had acquired a brand new ability—and it was common knowledge among the sisters that a witch couldn't possess two main abilities at the same time.



Tilly took off the glove and handed it to Ashes, "It's not that I have a new ability, but this stone." She cocked a smile, "It changed the way magic works, allowing it to manifest in a completely different effect."



Ashes caressed the gem in the center of the glove, greatly shocked. She knew that Tilly wouldn't lie to her—this meant that even non-combat witches could have combat abilities, significantly enhancing the witches' collective capacity to resist external enemies. "How many of these stones are there?"



"Only one," Tilly seemed to have guessed Ashes' thoughts, "And it's not so easy to use. You can try to imagine the magic as something tangible, fill the stone with it, and then release it."

Ashes pondered and struggled for a long time but did not produce a single spark of electricity.

"See?" she laughed, "We are the extraordinary ones, inherently able to sense magic. It's even harder for other witches. This requires exhausting one's imagination and understanding. In fact, I've tested many people, and only about two or three out of a hundred can quickly grasp and unleash lightning."

"Are you mocking me for being stupid?" Ashes took off her gloves.

"Pretty much," Tilly raised an eyebrow, "At that time, I only used—uh—"

Ashes kissed her, leaving her only able to murmur a low moan... After they parted, the latter took a long breath, "Well, you're not too dumb."

"What about the other stones?" Ashes licked her lips with lingering interest, only in front of the fifth princess could she completely relax, "Do they all possess different abilities?"

"They have different effects," Tilly corrected, her cheeks still flushed, "It doesn't grant ordinary people the abilities of a witch, only magic can activate it." She paused, "This leads me to a question."

"What question?"



"What exactly is magic power?" Tilly calmed her emotions and explained word by word, "For a long time, witches' abilities have been diverse and shown a high degree of uncertainty, and they also vary under the perception of the extraordinary. However, this strange stone completely unifies magic power, allowing any witch to release the exact same ability through it. Therefore, I might have been thinking in the wrong direction before. Magic power itself might be an omnipotent force, and what witches possess is just one of its manifestations."

"What about these magic stones?" Ashes asked.

"They can only release, but can't gather magic power. It's still unclear whether they are man-made or naturally formed," Tilly said with regret, "Legend has it that they were all excavated from ruins, and most of them have now fallen into the hands of the common people. I have only been able to collect this much... I heard there's an ancient ruin in the Eastern Region Forest of Seawindshire. I really want to go and see it for myself; maybe I could find more information about magic power and historical discontinuities."

She's talking about things I don't understand again, Ashes thought helplessly. As long as I can survive, who cares what happened over four hundred years ago, "It's better not to go. Seawindshire is probably one of the most dangerous places in Greycastle now."

"Why?"

"Before I set sail from Clearwater Harbor, I heard sailors chatting about it. Grace Wimbledon's Black Sail Fleet has all been mobilized, and their destination seems to be Seawindshire—that's Timothy's territory. She probably wants to use the flexibility and secrecy of the sea to strike directly at his rear camps," Ashes persuaded, "I only had the chance to leave the harbor after the martial law was lifted. If their information is accurate, Seawindshire might already be engulfed in flames."

"They are still killing each other," Tilly said with a worried look, "If this continues, it will only allow the Church to take advantage of the situation. If we can't unite, Greycastle will also be completely swallowed by the Church like Eternal Winter."

These words stunned Ashes, and the fifth princess quickly noticed her reaction, "What's wrong?"

"Nothing," she blinked, "You just now looked a bit like Roland Wimbledon. He also said the same thing to me."



"Oh? You actually met him?" Tilly became interested. "Right, you haven't told me what you gained from your trip to the Western Region. Tell me about it!"

"I went to Border Town after hearing about the Mutual Aid Society, Shadow should have told you that," Ashes embraced the other person. "It turned out that the so-called finding of the Holy Mountain was a trick set up by Roland. He took over the Mutual Aid Society and has been secretly recruiting witches..." She briefly recounted what she had seen and heard over the past week. "In the end, he told me that we must unite to withstand the attack of the Church, and if we can no longer stay in the Fjords, he would welcome us to Border Town at any time."



"Hmm..." Tilly pondered for a moment and suddenly said, "This person is not Roland Wimbledon; he has been replaced."

"Ah?"

"You said he has gathered a large number of witches around him, right? I guess a witch has controlled him, or simply transformed into his appearance," Tilly said bluntly. "I grew up with Roland since we were kids, and I couldn't be clearer about this—compared to the other two brothers and three sisters, he is the least good at concealing things, and when he lies, it's full of loopholes; he can't possibly pretend to be someone else. As for the kind of weapons you mentioned that can counter the God's Punishment Army, it further proves this point... A person can hide their nature but can't fabricate knowledge. The court tutors never taught these things, so how could he know about them?" Tilly spoke directly. "There is no one in this world who is born with such knowledge, so he can't possibly be my stupid and annoying brother."



"Is... that so?" Ashes frowned.

"Having said that, it's still necessary for me to get in touch with them," Tilly sighed. "After all, Roland Wimbledon is my brother, and although he's ignorant, he's not beyond redemption. Compared to the others, he is the least harmful one. I hope the witches from the Mutual Aid Society haven't buried him yet."

"I think they wouldn't do that," Ashes couldn't help but think of Wendy. "And I left Maggie there; at the end of the month, she will bring us more news from the town."

"That's all we can do for now, after all, our focus isn't here," the fifth princess stood up from her embrace and walked to the garden, spreading her arms. "Now that you're back, we can start implementing the cleaning plan. I will make sure that there are no traces of the Church left in the Fjords. Eventually, the islands of the Fjords will become a haven for witches."



The sunlight shone on Tilly from behind, coating her silhouette with a layer of golden fringe. Her grey hair brushed against her cheeks, like strands of light gold silk, her expression full of confidence, as if no difficulty could ever bring her down.

"I am at your service, my Queen," Ashes said with a smile.
