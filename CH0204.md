## Tilly Wimbledon
The two shared a tender moment before Ashes noticed the pile of gem-like trinkets laid out in front of her and asked curiously, "What are these?"



"Come here," Tilly patted the space beside her, "I'll show you something interesting."



Ashes sat down cross-legged next to her and watched as she donned a white silk glove on her hand, embedded with a sparkling red gem on the back.



"Is this... a tracking stone?"



Tilly did not answer but instead stretched her hand towards the empty space. Suddenly, a bolt of lightning leapt from her fingertips, striking the ground with crackling sounds. A wisp of blue smoke rose from the spot, leaving behind a palm-sized patch of scorched earth.



Ashes couldn't believe her eyes, "You... have acquired a new ability?"



Tilly Wimbledon was an Extraordinary; her magic worked upon herself, manifesting as exceptional intelligence. It was impossible for her to release it like an ordinary witch. Yet, the electric light suggested that she now possessed a brand-new ability—an impossibility, as witches could not have two primary abilities at the same time. This was common knowledge among the sisters.



Tilly took off the glove and handed it to Ashes, "It's not that I've acquired a new ability, but this stone." She curled her lips into a smile, "It changes the way magic operates, making it manifest in a completely different effect."



Ashes caressed the gem in the center of the glove, her heart deeply shocked. She knew Tilly would not deceive her—this meant that non-combat witches could also possess combat abilities, greatly enhancing the witches' capacity to resist external enemies. "How many of these stones are there?"



"Just one," Tilly seemed to have guessed what Ashes was thinking, "and it's not that easy to use. You can try to imagine magic power as something that actually exists, let it fill the stone, and then release it."

Ashes pondered hard for a long time but failed to produce even a spark of electricity.

"See?" she laughed, "We are still Extraordinaries, inherently able to sense magic power. It's even harder for other witches, requiring exhaustive imagination and understanding. In fact, I've tested many people, and only about two or three out of a hundred can quickly grasp and release lightning."

"Are you mocking me for being dumb?" Ashes took off her gloves.

"Pretty much," Tilly raised her eyebrows, "When I first did it, I only used—uh—"

Ashes kissed her, reducing her to murmurs and low moans... After they parted, Tilly took a deep breath, "Alright, you're not that dumb."

"What about the other stones?" Ashes licked her lips, still unsatisfied, feeling completely at ease only in front of the fifth princess, "Do they all have different abilities?"

"It's different effects," Tilly corrected, her cheeks still flushed, "It doesn't give ordinary people witch-like powers, only magic can activate it." She paused, "This has led me to a question."

"What question?"



"Magic, what exactly is it?" Tilly slowly calmed her emotions and explained word by word, "For a long time, witches' abilities have been diverse, showing extreme uncertainty, and they are perceived differently by extraordinary individuals. But this strange stone completely unifies magic. Any witch can release the same power through it, so I may have previously thought about it in the wrong way. Magic itself might be an omnipotent force, and what witches possess is just one form of its manifestation."



"And these magic stones?" Ashes asked.



"They can only release, but they cannot gather magic. It is still unclear whether they are man-made or naturally formed," Tilly said regretfully, "Legend has it that they were all excavated from ruins, and most of them have now scattered among the people. I've only been able to collect this much... I heard that there's an ancient ruin in the Eastern Region Forest of Seawindshire, I really want to go there and see for myself. Maybe I can find more information about magic and the gaps in history."



She's talking about things I don't understand again, Ashes thought helplessly. As long as I can survive, who cares what happened over four hundred years ago, "You better not. Seawindshire is probably one of the most dangerous places in Greycastle right now."



"Why?"



"Before I left from Clearwater Port, I overheard the sailors chatting about it, Grace Wimbledon's Black Sail Fleet has all set out, and it seems that their destination is Seawindshire—that's Timothy's territory. She probably wants to use the flexibility and concealment of the sea to strike directly at his rear camp," Ashes persuaded, "I only had the chance to leave port after the martial law was lifted. If their information is accurate, Seawindshire might already be engulfed in flames."



"They're still killing each other," Tilly said with a worried expression, "This will only allow the Church to take advantage of the situation. If they can't unite, Greycastle will be swallowed up by the Church just like Everwinter."



These words made Ashes pause, and the Fifth Princess quickly noticed her reaction, "What's wrong?"



"Nothing," she blinked, "You just reminded me of Roland Wimbledon for a moment. He's said the same thing to me before."



"Oh? You actually met him?" Tilly became interested. "Right, you never told me about what you gained from your trip to the Western Territory, tell me about it!"

"I went to Border Town after hearing the news from the Mutual Aid Society, Shadow should have told you that," Ashes pulled the other into her embrace, "But when I got there, I found out that the so-called finding of the Holy Mountain was actually a trap set by Roland. He took over the Mutual Aid Society and is secretly recruiting witches..." She briefly recounted what she had seen and heard over the past week, "In the end he told me that we must unite to resist the church's attack, and if we can no longer stay in the Fjords, he is always welcome for us to go to Border Town."

"Um..." Tilly pondered for a moment, then suddenly spoke up, "This person is not Roland Wimbledon; he has been replaced."

"Ah?"

"You said he's gathered a large number of witches around him, right? I guess a witch has taken control of him, or simply transformed into his appearance," Tilly said bluntly, "I grew up with Roland since we were little, I couldn't be clearer about this—compared to the other two brothers and the three princesses, what he's least good at is hiding things. His lies are full of holes, and he could never impersonate someone else. As for the weapons you mentioned that can fight against the God's Punishment Army, that proves my point even more... A person can hide their personality, but they can't fake knowledge. The court tutors never taught these things, so how could he possibly know?" Tilly said bluntly, "There is no one in this world who is born with such knowledge, so he definitely can't be my stupid and annoying brother."

"Is... is that so?" Ashes frowned.

"Having said that, it's still necessary for me to make contact with them," Tilly sighed, "Roland Wimbledon is ultimately my brother, though ignorant, he is not beyond redemption, and compared to the others, he's the least harmful. I hope the witches from the Mutual Aid Society haven't buried him yet."

"I think they wouldn't do that." Ashes couldn't help thinking of Wendy, "And I left Maggie there, by the end of the month, she will bring us more news from the town."

"That’s all we can do for now, after all, our focus is not here," the fifth princess stood up from her embrace and walked to the garden, spreading her arms, "Since you're back, we can start the cleaning plan. I will make sure that there won't be a trace of the church left in the Fjords. Eventually, the Fjords islands will become a safe haven for witches."



Sunlight shone on Tilly from behind, casting a golden outline around her figure. Her gray hair brushed against her cheeks, resembling delicate strands of gold. Her expression was full of confidence, as if no hardship could ever bring her down.

"I am at your service, my queen," Ashes smiled.
