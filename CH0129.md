## Classes Resume
The injured soldiers quickly received healing from Nana, for whom setting broken bones had become second nature. After Roland ordered the First Army to return to the camp, only the Chief Knight, the witches, and a few personal guards remained at the scene.



He walked over to the corpse with a grim face and directed Carter to cut open the gunshot wound on the victim's back.



The bullet hole was about one and a half fingers deep, and upon cutting it open, it was found that the lead ball had shattered, and the wound it inflicted was essentially no different from that on an ordinary person.



"What do you think?" he asked Carter.



Carter also seemed somewhat annoyed, probably because he hadn't expected to be outmaneuvered by someone who had never received swordsmanship training, "He had nothing but strength and speed, if I hadn't wanted to see what he was capable of, I could have chopped off his head with the first strike."



"What if the opponent were a knight?"



"This..." Carter pondered for a moment, "If it's one of the knights under the duke, I might just be able to manage, but if it were the Whirlwind Knights or the Steel Heart Knights from the King's City Knightage, I would be no match."



Roland neither agreed nor disagreed. Everyone relied on skill and swordsmanship to duel, and perhaps Carter was right. However, with equipment included, the situation could change dramatically. If the convict had been wearing heavy armor, a helmet, and wielding a two-handed greatsword during the test, he definitely would not have won so easily.



The boost from great strength was multifaceted—it allowed for the wearing of thicker armor and weapons, the ability to burst with greater speed, and to fight for longer durations. Roland felt he had to correct his previous thoughts back in Longsong Stronghold. Adrenaline? No, this thing was far more terrifying than adrenaline. At most, hormones could only stimulate the potential of the human body, but the red pill had clearly allowed the convict to surpass his own limits—especially the speed and momentum he displayed while running, which could almost match that of a heavy cavalry.



The black pill had a similarly astonishing effect; it rendered him immune to the pain from nearly severing his ribs with a horizontal slash and close-range gunshot wounds, preventing him from being stopped. An ordinary person would have already lost their fighting capability due to the pain.



If a strong commoner who did not fear pain was already this formidable, what about a group of well-trained soldiers? Thinking of what the High Priest had said, Roland couldn't help but frown.



"Your Highness," Nightingale spoke up, "look at his skin."



After the redness of the criminal's skin faded, it turned grayish-white and wrinkled profusely, resembling a snake shedding its skin. Roland prodded it with the hilt of his knife and found that beneath the skin was not solid muscle but an empty sensation. Upon cutting it open, they found that the subcutaneous fat had all turned into a viscous liquid, and the muscles had atrophied as well.



"This phenomenon is the same as after swallowing God's Punishment Stones," she looked at the prince, "the pill indeed contains elements of the stone."



"But simply swallowing the stones wouldn't produce an effect of amplified strength," Roland pondered, "how did they manage to create such an unscientific thing?"



The pill seemed to have severe side effects, and it was still unclear whether they were permanent or reversible. Roland leaned towards the former. If it was the latter, this drug, which was like a reinforced version of a morphine and adrenaline mix, could rightfully be regarded as a miraculous war medicine. As long as it was taken in batches according to the recovery time, it wouldn't be surprising if the Church used it to unite the world under their rule.



Even with its short duration and side effects, it was enough to warrant his vigilance, Roland thought. If the Church decided to support Timothy or Garcia, he might have to face an army high on drugs.



What worried him more was that the Church was willing to sell such things without considering that after the unification of Greycastle, the new king could use the pills to bite back at them. Greycastle could conscript far more cannon fodder for the battlefield than both the old and new Holy Cities combined. In a war of attrition, the Judgement Army would just be whittled away little by little.



Unless... they held an even stronger hand and didn't care about such matters at all.

Roland sighed at this thought. He had originally planned to solve the problems of insufficient population and funds in the town by attacking Longsong Stronghold, then focus on education, production, and agriculture, aiming to expand Border Town into a city in a short time. As for weapon research, it was to be put aside for the moment. However, it now seemed that the construction of the army could not be neglected either. The First Army needed to expand its numbers, the flintlock guns still had to be produced continuously, and research on new weapons had to be scheduled as soon as possible—such as the breech-loading rifle and fixed ammunition.

The mechanical principle of the breech-loading rifle was not difficult, and the fixed ammunition could be made with paper or by repeatedly stamping copper sheets.

The only thing Roland had no clue about was the primer used for the fixed ammunition. He only knew it was called mercury fulminate, and judging by the name, the ingredients must include nitric acid and mercury. Whether other substances needed to be mixed in, he couldn't remember at the moment. Moreover, he recalled that its production was sensitive to humidity and temperature, and it was highly dangerous—carelessness could lead to an explosion that would send one's fingers flying. After thinking it over, he decided to spend a considerable sum to recruit a group of alchemists to the town, build a laboratory in a corner, and let them figure it out on their own.

...

After dinner, Roland called Anna and Scroll into his office.

The finances of Border Town were now swelling, and he was about to invest half of his assets into the money-consuming and slow-yielding pit of compulsory education.

An industrial society required quality workers with basic cultural literacy, not illiterate brutes with mere brute strength. If universal education was not properly implemented, the demographic dividend would only turn into a demographic burden.

In light of this, he planned to start teaching classes every evening from today on. By the time Scroll mastered the basic knowledge of natural sciences, the town would likely have completed its first batch of literacy and education programs.



As the future pioneer of education and the all-knowing teacher, Roland naturally intended to impart all of his knowledge to Scroll. And inviting Anna to join was due to his partiality towards her.



Anna did not possess the ability to remember everything she read, but her thirst for knowledge and the will to actively learn were the strongest among all the witches. He often saw her searching for books in his bookshelf, and by now, she had likely read through the few books available multiple times over the half-year period. Furthermore, her speed of accepting new things and her logical way of thinking were rare in this era.



Taking the mathematics and physics textbooks that Scroll had transformed into, he began to explain the content of today's lesson.



Starting from basic addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, to slightly more complex equation calculations, Anna's comprehension clearly surpassed Scroll's by quite a bit. When it switched to physics, Scroll would mostly memorize Roland's words verbatim before slowly understanding them. Meanwhile, Anna would occasionally raise a few questions.



For instance, what basic particles looked like, and why objects composed of basic particles all had different shapes, and so on...



Some of these Roland could answer, while others he could not.



For example, what exactly was magic power.



He could only repeat the speculations he had thought about before, suggesting that magic power might be a form of energy, similar to electrical or thermal energy, and that currently, only witches could use it. He did not rule out the possibility that in the future, other ordinary people might also be able to store and use magic power through some method.



Anna showed a thoughtful expression.



Teaching women, especially those with outstanding elegance, always made time fly by quickly. Before he knew it, the candles had been changed twice, and the new one was about to burn out.



Suddenly, Roland heard a faint voice. Nightingale had fallen asleep on the couch without realizing it—perhaps such lessons were like lullabies to her, and now that the Mist had dissipated, her far from graceful sleeping posture was exposed to the three of them.



The prince shook his head with a wry smile, deciding to end the lesson there for the day. He took off his coat and gently covered her with it, then extinguished the candle. Along with a smiling Anna and the scrolls, he closed the door behind them.
