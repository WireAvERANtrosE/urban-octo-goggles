## Classes Resume
The injured soldier quickly received healing from Nana, who had become adept at setting fractures. After Roland had the First Army return to camp, only the Chief Knight, the witches, and a few bodyguards remained on the scene.



He walked over to the corpse with a grim expression and directed Carter to cut open the gunshot wound on the man's back.



The bullet hole was about a finger and a half deep, and upon cutting it open, they found that the lead ball had shattered, causing wounds not much different from those of an ordinary person.



"What do you think?" he asked Carter.



Carter also seemed somewhat vexed, probably because he hadn't expected to be outmaneuvered by someone who had never been trained in swordsmanship, "He had nothing but strength and speed. If I hadn't wanted to see how far he could go, I could have taken off his head with the first strike."



"What if the opponent had been a knight?"



"Well…" Carter thought for a moment, "If it were one of the knights under a duke, I might just be able to cope, but if it were a Whirlwind Knight or a Steel Heart Knight from the capital's Knightage, I would be no match for them."



Roland didn't openly agree or disagree. Everyone relied on skill and swordplay in a duel, and Carter might not be wrong, but the situation could change dramatically with the addition of equipment. Suppose the criminal had been tested while wearing heavy armor, a helmet, and wielding a two-handed greatsword; he certainly wouldn't have been defeated so easily.



The enhancement brought about by great strength was multifaceted—it allowed for wearing heavier armor and weapons, for bursting with greater speed, and for enduring longer in combat. Roland felt he needed to correct his previous thoughts at Longsong Stronghold—adrenaline? No, this was far more terrifying than adrenaline. Hormones at most trigger the potential of the human body, but the red pill had clearly allowed the criminal to break through his own limits. Especially the speed and momentum he displayed while running, which could almost match that of a heavy cavalryman.



The black pill also had an astonishing effect; it rendered him unstoppable even with a slash that nearly severed his ribs and close-range gunfire. A normal person would have lost their fighting ability due to the pain long ago.

A commoner with monstrous strength who felt no pain was already so formidable, what if it were a group of well-trained soldiers? Thinking of what the High Priest had said, Roland couldn't help but frown.



"Your Highness," Nightingale spoke, "look at his skin."



After the initial redness faded from the criminal's skin on his hands, it turned grayish-white and was covered in numerous wrinkles, like a snake shedding its skin. Roland prodded it with the hilt of his knife and found that beneath the skin was not solid muscle, but a hollow sensation. Upon cutting it open, he found that the subcutaneous fat had turned into a viscous fluid, and the muscles had atrophied as well.



"This phenomenon is the same as after swallowing the Divine Stone of Judgement," she looked towards the prince, "the pill indeed contains elements of the stone."



"But merely swallowing the stone would not produce the effect of amplified strength," Roland pondered, "how did they manage to create such an unscientific thing?"



The pill seemed to have strong side effects, and it was not yet clear whether they were permanent or recoverable. Roland leaned towards the former. If it was the latter, this drug, which was like a strengthened version of a mixture of morphine and adrenaline, could truly be called a war panacea. As long as it was taken in batches according to the recovery time, it would not be surprising for the Church to use it to unify the world.



Even if its duration was short and it had side effects, it was still enough for Roland to be cautious. If the Church turned to support Timothy or Grace, he might have to face an army on drugs.



What made him more uneasy was that the Church was willing to sell such a thing without considering that after the unification of Greycastle, the new king could use the pills to bite back at them? Greycastle could muster far more cannon fodder for the battlefield than both the old and new Holy Cities combined. In a war of attrition, the Judgement Army would only be gradually worn down to nothing.



Unless... they have a stronger hand and don't care about such things happening at all.

Roland sighed at this thought. He originally planned to solve the problem of insufficient population and funds in the town by attacking the Longsong Stronghold, then focusing on education, production, and agriculture, striving to expand Border Town into a city in a short period of time, while temporarily setting aside weapon research. Now it seemed, however, that he could not neglect the construction of the army either. The First Army needed to expand its numbers, the production of flintlock guns had to continue, and the research of new weapons had to be scheduled as soon as possible—like the breech-loading rifle and fixed ammunition.

The mechanical principle of the breech-loading rifle was not difficult, and the fixed ammunition could be made with paper or by repeatedly stamping copper sheets.

But as for the primer used in fixed ammunition, Roland still had no clue. He only knew that it was called mercury fulminate; by the literal meaning, the raw materials must contain nitric acid and mercury. As for whether other substances were needed, he couldn't remember at the moment. Moreover, he recalled that the production of this substance required specific humidity and temperature conditions and was quite dangerous—one careless mistake could blow one's fingers sky-high. After some thought, he decided to spend a large sum of money to recruit a group of alchemists, building a laboratory in a corner of the town for them to figure it out by themselves.

...

After dinner, Roland called Anna and Scroll into his office.

The financial purse of Border Town had already swollen, and he was about to invest half of the assets into the money-consuming pit of compulsory education, which yielded slow results.

An industrial society needed quality workers with basic cultural literacy, not illiterate people with mere brute strength. If universal education was not implemented properly, the demographic dividend would only turn into a demographic burden.

In view of this, he planned to start teaching classes every evening from today. By the time Scroll mastered the basics of natural science, the town would likely have completed the first batch of literacy and education tasks.



As the future pioneer of education and an all-encompassing teacher, Roland naturally wanted to pass on all he had learned to her. Inviting Anna to join was due to his partiality.



Anna did not possess the ability to remember everything she saw, but her thirst for knowledge and the will to learn proactively were the strongest among all the witches. He often saw her searching for books in his bookcase, and in half a year, she had probably read through the few books he had more than once. Besides, her speed in accepting new things and her logical way of thinking were rare in this age.



Taking the mathematics and physics textbooks that Scroll had transformed, he began to explain today's teaching content.



Starting with basic addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, and moving on to slightly more complex equation calculations, Anna's understanding ability was clearly superior to Scroll's. When it came to physics, Scroll would mostly memorize what Roland said verbatim before slowly understanding it. Anna, on the other hand, would occasionally ask questions.



For example, what do fundamental particles look like, and why do things made of fundamental particles have different shapes, and so on...



Some of these questions Roland could answer, and some he could not.



For example, what exactly is magic power.



He could only share his previous speculations, suggesting that magic power might be a kind of energy, similar to electricity and thermal energy, and that currently only witches could use it. He did not rule out that in the future, other ordinary people might also be able to store and use magic power through some means.



Anna looked thoughtful.



Teaching women, especially those with outstanding elegance, always made time fly by quickly. Unbeknownst to them, the candles had been changed twice, and the new one was about to burn out.



Suddenly, Roland heard a faint sigh; Nightingale had fallen asleep on the couch without realizing it—perhaps such lessons were like lullabies to her. The mist dissipated, revealing her far from graceful sleeping posture to the three of them.



The prince shook his head, amused yet helpless, and decided to end the lesson for the day. He took off his coat and gently covered her with it, blew out the candle, and left the room with a smiling Anna and the scroll, closing the door behind them.
