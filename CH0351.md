## Phantasmal (Part 1)
After completing the ceremony, Mayne supported the Pope back to the cart.

"Gerald." O'Brien gasped and called out in a low voice.

The Purifier in white emerged from a side door, her steps so light they were almost inaudible, "I am here."

Archbishop frowned; he had not expected a Purifier to be present in such a secretive location. Although they were raised by the Pope himself after their awakening and served His Eminence for life, these women were still witches after all... Moreover, it seemed that she knew about the existence of the Reflection Church even earlier than he did, which slightly displeased him.

"Take him to the Illusion Chamber."

"Mhm." She approached the praying table, pressed the carved holy scripture laid on it, and as magic light flashed, the huge painting behind slowly rose, revealing a dark metal gate. Gerald then took the pendant from the Pope's neck, inserted the crystal ornament into the lock on the gate, and turned it; a clicking sound came from inside, and the gate opened inward.

After removing the ornament, she did not return it to His Eminence O'Brien but handed it to Mayne instead.

The Archbishop turned to look at the Pope, who nodded, "Keep it. From now on, you will be in charge of guarding it. It can open both the secret library of the Secret Sanctuary and the secret doors of the research institutions."

"Let's go." Gerald smiled, took Mayne's hand, and entered the room behind the painting—this place should be where the surface church did not exist. In the same location, there was only a floor-to-ceiling window facing the Hermes Plateau.



The room looked very spacious, with a circular structure that was almost half the size of a prayer hall, capable of accommodating dozens of people standing side by side. It was difficult to associate it with the term "secret chamber." However, the vast space was devoid of any furnishings, appearing empty and desolate, with the only available seating being a stone bench that extended along the curved wall.



After the metal door closed, Mayne shook off the hand of the Purifier. "Did His Highness allow you to come in with me?"



Jill shrugged indifferently, "If I didn't come in, who would activate the Illusionary Magic Stone? You can't drive magic power."



Such an impudent response made Mayne's heart skip a beat; it seemed she still considered herself a witch of His Highness Oberon. When he took over the scepter and controlled the church, he would definitely make her understand that not only the Pope himself, but also the archbishops with the right of succession were figures deserving of respect.



"Then let us begin," he suppressed the emotions rising in his heart and sat down on the stone bench.



"Yes, my lord," Jill lifted a hidden panel on the wall and pressed her hand on the magic stone, "But please be prepared, as this is also my first time activating it."



The first time? Hadn't she lived for over two hundred years? Had she never participated in the papal succession ceremony before? Mayne felt slightly puzzled, but before he could think further, a dazzling light flashed, and to his surprise, he found himself plunged into darkness.



The darkness was so pure that he could not perceive any light source; the walls, floor, and the stone bench seemed to have vanished. It was as if a behemoth of the abyss had swallowed him whole, losing all sense of distance and direction. The heavens and the earth merged indistinguishably, with everything within sight engulfed by blackness. Lowering his head, even his own body seemed to be erased into it.



Mayne held his breath and carefully reached down to feel around, the stone bench was still beneath him, and stomping his feet, the floor was the same. This comforted him slightly. It seemed that he had not been transported to a new underground chamber, but rather the power of the magic stone had swallowed all the light in this place.



However, in such darkness, how could one possibly see the "truth" that His Highness spoke of?

As if in answer to his question, the ground lit up once again, but it was clear that this was not a scene within the secret chamber. Each stone slab was polished to a smooth and clear finish, engraved with elaborate and exquisite patterns, reflecting a faint blue luster. Soon, light also poured down from above, and to his amazement, a transparent skylight appeared on the ceiling. Through this window, he could even see the clear sky and clouds outside.

Before long, other furnishings in the room began to appear one by one: a marble round table, a circle of chairs, maps and glass cups on the table, curtains hanging all around, decorative swords and shields standing erect, and the head of a giant-horned deer hanging at the top of the main entrance.

Then came the figures.

Maine could hardly believe his eyes as lifelike images of women appeared before him, dressed in magnificent robes, sitting around the round table. The one seated directly opposite the main entrance, at the head of everyone, was unmistakably the red-haired Witch Queen. Her hands hung down, crossed in front of her, her chest puffed out, her eyes looking straight ahead, while everyone else's gaze was focused on her. Everything looked like a vivid painting.

Is this the meaning represented by the illusion room? Maine thought to himself. When the scene before his eyes became as rich as a real environment, it was as if everyone had come to life in an instant.

"Ladies, the God's Punishment Army experiment has been successful," a witch next to Akaris spoke up, "They appear to be extremely ferocious, fearless of life and death, and possess immense strength—even the witches with minor abilities can be transformed into warriors as powerful as the original Transcendents. In addition, they have the ability to disrupt the release of magic power, which undoubtedly gives them a great advantage when facing the Frenzied Demons and Hell Lords who also rely on activating magic stones for battle."

"But the transformation ceremony requires the life of a witch, and I've heard that not everyone can be successfully transformed," someone said.

"These are just some insignificant details," she spread her hands, "I believe that as research continues, the Quest Society will certainly find a way to compensate for this."



"Do not speak so lightly, Elaine, we are already few in number, each witch is precious!" the person frowned and said.



"What difference does it make to die at the hands of devils or to die in a ritual," Elaine said proudly, "at least the latter can make a final contribution to the Union."



"What did you say—"



"Enough." Agatha said softly. Although her voice was low, the scene instantly quieted down, everyone shut their mouths, waiting for the Witch Queen to speak.



"Mortals cannot defeat devils, my sisters," she said calmly, "We can do nothing and enjoy this last piece of tranquility, quietly waiting for the next devil invasion, after which history will completely erase us. Alternatively, we can make one last stand, place our hope in the God's Punishment Warriors, and make sacrifices for it. I admit it's a tough choice, but as long as humanity continues, the lineage of witches will never be severed."



"Although I am the Queen of Starfall City, I am willing to leave this significant choice to you: whether to give up resistance and die quietly, or to seek vengeance for our fallen sisters, drive the devils out of the Dawn realm, and restore the former glory of the witches, it's all up to you."



"Of course, no one here can personally take part in the third Battle of Divine Will, so regardless of the choice, we can all safely live out this short life. Remember, the decision you're making now is not just for yourselves, but for the witch community... for the future sisters to still see the smile of the deities."



"Those who disagree, please stand up now."
