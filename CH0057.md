## Snake Witch Hakkala
But Wendy did not become as excited as she did, instead, she asked with a skeptical tone, "Did he really say that?"



"Yes, before I got there, he had already saved Anna and Nana. The prince never believes that the power of witches comes from the devil; he says it is our own power—" Nightingale suddenly stopped, realizing that the other party did not believe what she had said.



Well, she thought, it's not Wendy's fault. If it were her, she probably wouldn't be swayed by a witch's description either. Witches have been oppressed for too long, traveling all the way from the Eastern Region to the Impassable Mountain Range, too many living examples laid before them—being betrayed, being abandoned was all too common, and they had long lost the ability to trust others easily.



With that thought, her excitement gradually subsided; perhaps this trip would not be as smooth as she had imagined.



"Wendy, you know about my ability to branch out, aside from being able to see the flow of magic, I can also discern whether others are lying," Nightingale spoke earnestly, "I once asked him, why take such a great risk to do this for witches, and he answered me, 'Border Town does not care about one's background.' He hopes that all witches will become free people."



"By doing this, he will become a thorn in the Church's side," Wendy frowned, "Even if the prince doesn't understand what this means, don't you?"



Nightingale couldn't help but let out a light chuckle, "My initial thoughts were almost the same as yours. I asked him, can all this really be achieved? Guess how he answered me?" She paused, then slowly said, "‘If you don't take this step, you'll never know the answer.’"



"He wasn't lying?"



"He wasn't lying." Nightingale affirmed.



"It sounds incredible," Wendy's tone slightly relaxed, unable to think of a reason why her friend of many years would deceive her.



"Yes," Nightingale empathized. Had she not seen it with her own eyes and had the ability to verify it, she probably wouldn't have made up her mind so quickly. Looking back on it now, just as Roland had said to her on the watchtower of the city wall, he indeed rarely lied. In the nearly two months they had spent together, except for not being completely honest about the use of Ice Calamity, everything else had satisfied Nightingale.



Of course, she didn't mind that little deception. It would be strange if one were to completely open up all their secrets to a witch they had just met not long ago.



"Tonight, after everyone comes back, I will tell the sisters this important news!" she looked at Wendy and said in a serious tone, "I hope you can help me persuade everyone."



As evening arrived, the witches who had been busy outside started returning to the camp one after another. Seeing Nightingale return safely, everyone was happy and crowded around her, asking all sorts of questions. Seeing the white bands wrapped around their arms, Nightingale felt a heavy feeling in her heart. After casually answering a few questions, she raised her hand to quiet everyone down.



What followed was a long narration. She began with her infiltration of Border Town, her encounters with Roland, Anna, and Nana, to the building of the city wall, the assembly of the steam engine, the resistance against the demonic beasts, and finally, Anna's coming of age. Nightingale took out the stolen steam engine design from her bosom to prove to everyone that she was not lying.



Most of the witches had been living isolated lives after joining the Witch Cooperation Association, and it was hard for them to imagine life outside. They listened intently to every word. When Nightingale mentioned that Anna had not suffered any pain and had safely reached adulthood, the crowd burst into an uproar. This was a major issue that plagued witches their entire lives. They endured hunger and cold, fleeing to the Impassable Mountain Range in search of the legendary Holy Mountain. If, as Nightingale said, there was a lord of a domain who was willing to accept them and they might also be free from the torment of demonic possession, wouldn't that be even more perfect than the Holy Mountain abode?



Just then, a path opened up in the crowd, and a witch with green hair and half a serpent tattoo on her face approached Nightingale.



"Respected Mentor, greetings," Nightingale bowed to her. The person was none other than the founder of the Witch Cooperation Association, the Serpent Witch, Cara. In the Association, the sisters all addressed her as Mentor.



"I've heard the stories you spoke of," her voice was hoarse and hollow, "are you trying to tell everyone that what we are doing now is all wrong?"

"No, mentor, those aren't just stories, what I mean is—"

"Enough," she waved her hand impatiently, "I don't know what you encountered in Border Town to utter such words. A prince, sympathizing with witches? It's as ludicrous as sympathizing with frogs," she sneered as she turned around, spreading her arms and shouting, "Sisters! Have you all forgotten how those mortals treated you?"



Before Nightingale could explain, she continued her accusation: "Yes, mortals, that incompetent bunch masquerading in the name of gods, directing their blades and whips at us. Without the God's Punishment Stones, what right do they have to trample witches underfoot? Our powers are not from demons, they are blessings from the deities, and it should not be the Church that acts on behalf of the gods, but us! Sisters of the Cooperation Association! The Holy Mountain recorded in the ancient texts is the dwelling place of the deities!"



What... Nightingale could hardly believe her own ears. Although she had always thought the leader of the Cooperation Association was a bit eccentric and excessively obsessed with finding the Holy Mountain, she was far from madness. Cara might not be as approachable as Wendy, but at least her care for her sisters was genuine and sincere. But unexpectedly, she harbored such hostility towards ordinary people.



Could it be that for the past years she had been suppressing her own hatred and anger? That the so-called non-interference in worldly affairs was just to accumulate strength, in exchange for a day of thunderous revenge in the future? Nightingale thought to herself, what now had caused her to no longer want to hide her true feelings? Could it be...



"We have found the clue to the opening of the Holy Mountain, just as it is recorded in the ancient texts! In just twenty more days, when the blood-red moon appears in the night sky, passing through that huge stone gate rising from the ground, we will reach the final shore!" She turned back to Nightingale, "You have been deceived by mortals, we have been living in a huge deception from the moment we were born. The torment of adulthood is a test by the deities of our spirit and flesh, only those with firm will and indomitable spirit are worthy of obtaining true power. As for the Church," she sneered twice, "a bunch of mortals daring to act in the name of deities, they will all eventually go to hell."



"And you... child, it’s not too late to turn back now," Cara paused, "Forget the stories you spoke of, I can forgive your ignorance and mistakes, and accept you again as a member of the Cooperation Association, to join us in seeking eternity in the Holy Mountain."



Nightingale's heart had completely cooled down. Torment is a test? Were those sisters who suffered the agony of devouring upon awakening and didn’t make it through just dismissible failures? This rhetoric was practically identical to that of the Church. And the witches around her actually showed a look of agreement, even Wendy did not step forward... She suddenly felt disinterested, and in the blink of an eye, the founder of the Cooperation Association, the guide of the witches, had become a stranger to her.



She shook her head, "If that's the case, I will take away the sisters who are willing to leave with me, and for those who decide to stay here... I wish you good luck."

Just as Nightingale was about to take her leave, a slight sting came from her calf. She looked down and found a black snake with blue stripes biting into her leg muscle—this was a Magic Snake, silent and invisible, capable of using various toxins, a common ability used by the witch Cara.

Paralysis quickly spread throughout her body. Nightingale opened her mouth to say something, but what greeted her was complete darkness.
