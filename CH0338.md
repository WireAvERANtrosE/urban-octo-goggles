## "Police"
Wendy turned over and got out of bed, trying to move his body. There was no pain in his back at all; it seemed that the knight was right, leaving the wound alone allowed it to heal quickly.

"How do you feel?" Kukacim asked. "Maybe you should rest a bit more."

"It's nothing serious. Didn't I do well yesterday too?" Wendy put on his worn coat and tucked his feet into the ice-cold boots. "Besides, working for them one day earlier means getting porridge sooner. I can't always eat yours; one bowl is simply not enough for two."

"I actually think it's quite good. The porridge here is much thicker than the relief soup in other places, and you can even taste a bit of meat," the old man shook his head. "Child, you were a patrol member before, you might not be aware of the life in the slums. The porridge there is just like clear soup, with only a few grains of wheat added. To make it look more substantial, they often cook it with grass roots or tree leaves. The porridge given out by the lord might not be enough to fill you up if split into two, but it won't leave you starving either."

"I want us both to be full." He tied his shoelaces and said with a smile.

"Alright," Kukacim sighed. "Then take good care of yourself and don't overdo it."

It was a strange feeling. He was just a scapegoat chosen by an old rat from the dark alleys, but now it felt like he had become a family elder, Wendy thought to himself. What was even stranger was that he actually found this feeling not too bad.

"I will," he said with an amused shake of his head, putting on his hood. "You too."

As soon as he opened the door, he saw two men standing outside. Their uniforms with light blue shoulder badges and armbands identified them—they were officials from the City Hall.



Widow's brows furrowed slightly, "Who are you looking for?"

One of them pulled out a piece of paper and glanced at it, "Are you Widow?"

"Yes."

"What happened?" Kukasim also noticed the situation outside the house.

"Congratulations," another person smiled, "You have passed the written test for the Public Security Team members. Next will be a week of comprehensive training," he handed a small card to Widow, "This is your temporary ID. Take it to the Second Army Camp, where someone will receive you."

The latter's eyes widened, "I... passed Lord's assessment?"

"Not yet," the officer replied, "The written test is just the first round of selection. You still need to complete the training and be recognized by the Chief Knight before you can pass the assessment and become an official member of the Public Security Team."

After saying their piece, the two men left straight away, neither asking for money nor currying favor, seeming to have come solely to deliver the message.

"You succeeded!" The old man excitedly patted Widow on the shoulder, "What did you say before? That there was absolutely no chance you'd be selected."



Wade was stunned for a long time before he muttered, "Because those questions were just too strange."



The old man was slightly startled, "What questions?"



Wade couldn't help but recall the events of a week ago. Since learning that His Highness the Prince was recruiting public security officers—a fancy name for the patrol guards—he had applied at the town hall as advertised. The response was incredibly swift; just five days later, he received a notice to take the test.



Wade was confident; he not only met all the requirements listed in the announcement but also had over five years of practical experience. The town indeed lacked personnel to supervise the populace, and the likelihood of him being selected was very high. If he could become a patrol officer, he could help Kukasim at any time, even if he lived in the inner city district.



But what he didn't expect was that the test from the beginning would be beyond everyone's expectations.



Over a hundred candidates sat in a hall as the knight handed out a stack of papers to each, instructing them to answer all the questions listed and to write their answers neatly on the paper, adding that the final reviewer would be His Highness the Prince himself. This method of testing immediately caused an uproar among the crowd. Although the announcement had stated that applicants should be literate, nobody thought they would be serious about it.



At that moment, more than half of the people were dumbfounded. Although Wade could understand the questions on the paper, after carefully scanning them, he was equally stunned—what kind of strange questions were these? For example, "You are a coachman driving a four-wheeled carriage on a narrow mountain path with two civilians sitting in the carriage. Suddenly, a group of refugees appears on the road ahead, and you can't avoid them in time. You only have the choice to run into them or let the carriage fall off the cliff. The former would result in many refugees dying, the latter would cause the death of two civilians, and in either case, you could survive due to your agile skills. What would your choice be? Please explain your reasoning in at least three hundred words."



The question was utterly baffling. Although it mentioned that one side was civilians and the other refugees, the specific numbers were all unclear, making it impossible to weigh the decision. Moreover, he always felt that running over a group of refugees seemed not too serious, but that might not be the answer His Highness the Prince was looking for.



So, choose to let the civilians die? Could that possibly be the correct answer?



And on the whole paper, there were similar strange questions written. He even thought at that time that His Highness was deliberately making things difficult for them, when in fact, the real security officers had already been decided.



"It's nothing, maybe I'm just overthinking it," Wode took a deep breath, "Then I'm off to the camp now."



"Mhm," Kukacim laughed heartily, "I think you'll definitely become a formal security officer."



...



The second military camp was located to the north of the town, outside the inner city stone wall. When Wode arrived, he found that Sir Knight Chief was already waiting in the camp.



"From today on, you are the reserve police," Carter began after everyone had arrived, "Over the next week, you must live in this camp and undergo special training. Those who qualify can stay; those who don't can roll back to where they came from! I will make you understand what discipline means, and what it means to serve the prince!"



This was more like the kind of assessment Wode remembered, only... out of the hundred or so applicants, the other party had only kept fifteen? He looked around, and judging from the attire and complexion, except for himself, the others seemed to be locals.



Indeed, the requirement to be literate was not a joke.



"Report!" someone raised their hand.



Carter grinned, "Oh? You seem quite familiar with the military, aren't you? Go on."



"Hehe, my brother is in the First Army," the man said, scratching the back of his head, "Excuse me, sir, but what is a policeman? Aren't we public security officers?"



"The police are a part of the public security system. You can think of them as the peacekeeping personnel within His Highness's territory. They are responsible for arresting criminals, combating illegal activities, maintaining order in the territory, implementing policies issued by His Highness and the city hall, as well as assisting citizens in need."



"Assisting citizens? But you just said we serve His Highness, the Prince..."



"There's no difference between the two. Serving the citizens of His Highness is also serving His Highness. Why, do you also wish to enter the castle to serve him?" Carter shrugged, "Become an excellent knight first."



However, knights are nobles... thought Veder, their status is worlds apart from us commoners, it's not something you can become just by wanting it.



"Remember, you are both enforcers of the law and protectors of the people. Now, go to the tent and change into your uniform," the Chief Knight clapped his hands, "Next, there's a task that we will be assigning you to carry out."
