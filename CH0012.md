## firing
Roland stood in the backyard of the kiln room, waiting for the first batch of cement to be produced.



This brick house was specially designed by him for cement production, about fifteen meters long and four meters wide. There were doors at both ends, the difference being that the front door was as wide as possible for people to move materials through, while the back door was only wide enough for one person, allowing Anna to sneak into the kiln room.



For this purpose, he had also built a surrounding wall around the middle of the house, enclosing the back half of the kiln room, with the entrance and exit guarded by knights— they were all subordinates of Carter, and their loyalty was beyond doubt.



The production process of cement sounded simple: crush limestone into powder and mix it with clay and iron filings. Then calcine it into clinker using either a dry or wet method, and finally, grind it together with gypsum for use. The raw materials were all very common; iron filings, which were difficult to produce in large quantities, could be omitted. The key lay in the calcining temperature of the clinker.



Roland did not remember the specific temperature required for firing cement, and even if he did, he had no way to measure and control the temperature— infrared thermometers and thermocouple temperature guns were countless times more complex than cement. He only knew that this temperature was almost as high as the melting point of iron, and the calcining step was also a difficult part of cement production.



In the era of underdeveloped smelting technology, maintaining a high furnace temperature had always been a problem that plagued everyone. Ordinary open furnaces lost a lot of heat, making it difficult to maintain the furnace temperature above 1200 degrees. Reflective furnaces required high-temperature resistant linings, and he couldn't think of how to make refractory bricks on the spot. Traditional blast furnaces were even less suitable— the temperature might meet the requirements, but relying on that narrow furnace chamber to calcine cement would likely take so long that even the Evil Months would pass without producing a sufficient quantity.



Therefore, the kiln room designed by Roland had no heating measures at all; he relied on Anna.



The limestone, broken down manually into small particles, was mixed with clay and water to create a slurry, which was evenly spread inside the kiln room. Then the knights locked the front door and cleared away the menial workers. Anna would enter through the back door, allowing her flames to bake the slurry on the ground until the iron rods placed inside the room melted.



Roland felt somewhat anxious; this was his first step in establishing a foothold in Border Town. If he couldn't produce cement, the plan to build a wall in three months would be nothing but empty talk. Without a wall to hold them back, he feared no one would be willing to stand their ground in this forsaken place. Whether in real history or fictional literature, in order to cultivate the land properly, a stable base was essential.



"Your Highness, can this stuff really glue stones together?" Carter Lannis, who stood by the side of the Fourth Prince, asked. Although the prince had told him it was the latest research achievement of the Greycastle Alchemy Workshop, he remained skeptical. After all, those people had never produced any truly reliable alchemical products.



"Who knows? That's what they claim anyway," Roland said with a shrug.



In this world, alchemy and astrology were collectively referred to as the Art of the Wise and were very popular among the nations of the continent. The royal families would usually cultivate their own alchemists and astrologers for the preparation of secret potions and fortune-telling. For the common people, these studies were too esoteric, leading to a blind faith in them. Considering this, Roland naturally attributed the source of the cement formula to the Alchemy Workshop. Whether the Chief Knight believed it or not was utterly irrelevant.



The flame peeking out of the window gradually extinguished, signaling that the burning was done.



Roland stood up with a whoosh, ushered Carter out of the yard, and waited alone at the back door of the brick house.



The iron door creaked open, and Anna stepped out, naked. Roland immediately draped his robe over her and handed her a cup of water, "How did it go?"



The witch's face was covered in soot. Although the wet process cement produced less dust, the hot air during calcination could still raise dust. For her, who could not wear a mask, staying inside for tens of minutes was clearly uncomfortable. She coughed twice and nodded, "The slurry has turned into ash powder."



Roland couldn't wait for the temperature in the kiln to drop low enough. He wrapped a wet towel around his head, grabbed a shovel, and entered through the back door.



The high heat enveloped him instantly, making it difficult to breathe, and the skin on his hands stung from the heat. Fortunately, shoveling the ash didn't take too much time; otherwise, staying in such an environment for a few minutes could potentially lead to heatstroke.



"Is this what you wanted?" Anna asked, stretching her head out after putting on the witch's suit.



"It looks very similar," Roland replied as he smoothed out the powder and felt its residual warmth with his finger, "but we won't know if it works until we try it."



"What is it used for?"



"Building houses, constructing bridges, repairing roads. There are too many applications. If it's successful, the homes of our people will no longer fear the cold, and neither heavy rain nor snow will be able to destroy them." He patted the little girl's head with his other hand, "It's all thanks to you."



Anna lowered her head. He wasn't sure if it was an illusion, but he felt that the girl's breathing quickened for a moment.



In theory, the clinker should be ground with gypsum to adjust its setting time. But at this moment, there was no need to consider so much. After a short rest, Roland shoveled out two more scoops and then called over Carter, who was standing outside the courtyard, instructing him to mix the cement mortar in a ratio of three parts ash to one part river sand.



The Chief Knight did not mind doing the heavy labor at all. To him, this work was far more preferable than fighting and brawling for His Highness in the capital or flirting with noble ladies during outings.



Because no iron filings were added to the raw materials, the resulting cement paste was pale in color, showing a grayish-white hue. Roland poured it all onto a stone brick and then covered it with another. The cement set in about four hours, but considering the instability of the trial product, he decided to simply wait until the next day to see the results.



The next morning, Roland hurried over to the backyard of the burning room with Carter and Anna. Pushing open the door, he noticed that the cement had solidified on the surface and was tightly bonded between the two stone bricks. The surface of the set cement was rough and uneven, with some areas showing efflorescence.



Roland squatted down, scraped off the white frost produced by the alkali reaction, and pressed his finger against the hardened cement. The sensation delighted him—the cement surface was tough and rough to the touch, completely different from the sensation of compacted soil. Even if he used his fingernail to scratch hard, he couldn't leave a single mark.



Carter, upon receiving a signal from the Fourth Prince, first tried to lift the stone brick but was unsuccessful. He then kicked it fiercely from the side several times until the joint between the cement and the ground broke apart, yet the two stone bricks remained firmly bonded together. In the end, he swung the hilt of his sword to hit them, managing only to chip off a small piece from the corner.



"Is this the effect of 'cement'?" Carter immediately realized its function, "It's unbelievable. Yesterday it was flowing like melted wax, and in just one night, it has become as solid as rock. With this stuff, we can build walls as quickly as we want. As long as we have enough stones, we could even build a wall around the borders of the kingdom within five years!"



"What's the use of that?" Roland responded dismissively, "No matter how tall and grand a wall is, it can't stop enemies from within. I would rather turn all the dilapidated wooden houses of Border Town into sturdy cement houses, so that my subjects no longer have to worry about being homeless after a disaster."



"..." The Chief Knight was stunned, he really did not expect the Fourth Prince, who embodied various noble vices, to say such a thing.



"You'll see in the future," Roland affirmed the path he was determined to take—For many transmigrators, technology is the primary productive force. But here, witches are the primary productive force.
