## Firing (This term is context-dependent; in the context of pottery or brick-making, "firing" is the process of hardening the material using high temperatures. However, without additional context, a precise translation may vary.)
Roland stood in the backyard of the kiln room, waiting for the first batch of cement to come out of the furnace.
This brick house was specially designed by him for cement production, about fifteen meters long and four meters wide. There were doors at both ends, the difference being that the front door was as wide as possible to allow people to move materials in and out, while the back door was only wide enough for one person, allowing Anna to sneak into the kiln room.
For this reason, he also built a wall around the halfway point of the house, enclosing the back half of the kiln room, with exits guarded by knights—Carter's subordinates, whose loyalty was beyond doubt.
The production process of cement is simple to speak of: crush limestone into powder, mix it with clay and iron filings, and then calcine it into clinker using a dry or wet method, grind it with gypsum, and it's ready to use. The raw materials are very common, and iron filings, which are difficult to produce in large quantities, can be omitted. The key lies in the calcination temperature of the clinker.
Roland did not remember the specific temperature required for cement calcination, and even if he did, he had no way to measure and control the temperature—neither an infrared thermometer nor a thermocouple temperature gun were more complex than cement by several orders of magnitude. He only knew that this temperature was almost close to the melting point of iron, and the calcination process was also a difficult part of cement production.
In an era of undeveloped metallurgy, maintaining a high furnace temperature has always been a problem that plagued everyone. The heat loss of an ordinary open furnace was immense, making it difficult to maintain temperatures above 1200 degrees. A reverberatory furnace, on the other hand, required a high-temperature-resistant lining, and he couldn't figure out how to make firebricks for the time being. The traditional blast furnace for smelting iron was even less suitable. The temperature might meet the standards, but relying on its narrow chamber to calcine cement would probably not produce enough quantity even if the Month of Demons had passed.
Therefore, the kiln room designed by Roland had no heating measures at all; he relied on Anna.
After manually crushed small limestone particles were mixed with clay and water to form a slurry, it was evenly spread inside the kiln room. Then the knights locked the main door, cleared away the laborers. Anna entered from the back door, allowing flames to bake the slurry on the ground until the iron rods placed in the room melted.
Roland was somewhat restless. This was his first step in staying at Border Town. If he couldn't produce cement, the plan to build a city wall in three months would be just empty talk. Without a wall to block, few would be willing to hold their ground in this forsaken place. Whether in real history or in fictional literature, to farm well, a stable base was essential.
"Your Highness, can this thing you mentioned really glue stones together?" Carter Lannis, who stood beside the Fourth Prince, asked. Although the prince had told him that this was the latest research achievement of the Greycastle Alchemy Workshop, he was still skeptical. After all, those people had never produced any truly reliable alchemical products.
"Who knows? Anyway, that's what they say," Roland spread his hands.
Alchemy and astrology were collectively referred to as the art of the wise in this world and were very popular in mainland countries. The royal families would generally cultivate their own alchemists and astrologers for the concoction of secret medicines and prediction of fate. For ordinary people, these studies were so high-end that they induced blind faith. Considering this, Roland naturally shifted the source problem of the cement formula to the Alchemy Workshop. As for whether the chief knight believed it or not, that was absolutely irrelevant.
The flames that had been coming out of the window gradually extinguished, indicating that the calcination was likely complete.
Roland stood up quickly, chased Carter out of the yard, and waited alone by the back door of the brick house.
The iron door creaked open, and Anna walked out naked. Roland immediately draped his robe over her and handed her a cup of water. "How did it go?"
The witch's face was covered in gray dust. Although the wet process of making cement reduced dust emissions, the scorching air during calcination would still raise dust. For her, who couldn't wear a mask, staying inside for dozens of minutes was obviously uncomfortable. She coughed twice and nodded, "The slurry has turned into ash powder."

Roland couldn't wait for the temperature in the kiln to drop enough; he wrapped a wet towel around his head, grabbed a shovel, and squeezed through the back door.

The hot air surrounded him instantly, making it somewhat difficult to breathe, and the skin on his hands felt sore from the heat. Thankfully, shoveling out the ash didn't take too much time; otherwise, staying in this environment for a few minutes could likely cause heatstroke.

"Is this what you wanted?" Anna asked, poking her head through after donning her witch's suit.

"It looks like it," Roland spread out the powder and felt its residual heat with his fingers, "but we won't know if it works until we try it."

"What's it for?"

"Building houses, bridges, and roads—there are too many uses. If it's successful, our people's homes will no longer fear the cold, and neither heavy rain nor snow will be able to destroy them." He patted the young girl's head with his other hand. "It was thanks to you that we made it."

Anna lowered her head. He wasn't sure if it was an illusion, but he felt her breathing quicken slightly.

In theory, the finished clinker should be ground with gypsum to regulate its setting time. But that wasn't a concern at the moment. After a brief rest, Roland shoveled out two more batches, and then called Carter, who was standing outside the yard, to prepare the cement mortar with a ratio of three parts ash powder to one part river sand.

The Chief Knight didn't mind doing rough work at all, and for him, doing such things was much better than fighting and flirting with noble ladies on behalf of the prince back in Greycastle.

Since no iron powder was added to the raw materials, the resulting cement paste was pale in color, presenting a grayish-white hue. Roland poured it onto a stone brick and covered it with another. With the cement's setting time around four hours, considering the instability of the prototype, he decided to wait until the next day to see the results.

Early the next day, Roland hurried to the kiln's backyard with Carter and Anna. Pushing open the door, he noticed the cement on the surface had solidified and was tightly bonded to the two stone bricks. The hardened surface was rough, with some areas showing efflorescence.

Roland crouched down, scraped off the efflorescence produced by the alkali reaction, and pressed on the hardened cement with his fingers, feeling pleased—the surface was hard and rough, completely different from the feel of compacted dirt, and even with his fingernails forcefully scratching, he couldn't leave a mark.

At Roland's signal, Carter first tried to lift the stone bricks but was unsuccessful. He then kicked fiercely at the side until the joint between the cement and the ground broke, but the two stone bricks remained firmly bonded together. Finally, he swung the hilt of his sword to strike them, only managing to knock off small pieces from the edges.

"Is this the effect of 'cement'?" Carter immediately realized its function, "It's incredible. It was as fluid as melted wax yesterday, and now it's as solid as rock overnight. With this stuff, we can build city walls as quickly as we want. As long as we have enough stones, we could even build a wall around the kingdom's borders in five years!"

"What's the use of that?" Roland said dismissively, "No matter how tall or strong, walls can't stop enemies from within. I'd rather turn all the rundown wooden houses in Border Town into sturdy cement houses, so my people never have to worry about being homeless after a disaster again."

The Chief Knight was stunned, as he had never expected the fourth prince, who combined various noble flaws, to say such a thing.

"You'll see in the future," Roland reaffirmed the path he had chosen—for many transmigrators, technology is the primary productive force. But here, witches are the primary productive force.
