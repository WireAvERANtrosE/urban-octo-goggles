## The Horn of the Decisive Battle
In the palace hall of the Eternal Winter City, the fire in the fireplace was already burning fiercely. Compared to the distinct seasons of Greycastle, the summers here were exceptionally short, and autumn felt more like a prelude to the impending severe cold. Even before one had the chance to change into lighter, short clothing, the chill wind would once again arrive stealthily.



Grace Wimbledon, draped in a fox fur coat, sat upright on the throne, listening to the complaints and demands of the nobles.



She did not like this palace; the pillars, walls, and floors were all made of snow-white stone, each piece polished to a smooth and shining finish, looking just like solid ice. Despite adding two layers of velvet cushions to her seat, she could still feel the bone-chilling cold emanating from the iron chair.



This damned house is just like one made of ice, she thought displeasedly. Once the situation has stabilized, the first thing to do would be to smash all the ground and walls and then relay them with dark brown granite slabs.



"Your Majesty, I hope you can help me obtain justice!"



A noble said with a mournful face.



This fellow had been rambling on and on, but in reality, his point could be made clear in just a few sentences. It was nothing more than the church taking over the royal capital and conducting public trials against some of the more notorious nobles, presided over by Bishop Heather. Most of them ended up on the gallows, but this guy was lucky, only being sentenced to confiscation of property, which was then distributed among the victimized commoners.



"I understand your request, personal property should not be plundered," Grace pondered for a moment, then slowly began, "However, the specific amount is difficult to define. How about this—if you can provide the financial income and expenditure statements for the past five years, I can extract a portion from the confiscated property to compensate you."



"However, the mob has looted my mansion clean, I'm afraid these records are..."

"Then I can only compensate you according to the standards announced in the proclamation," Grace interrupted. "Look around you; all of these are nobles who have suffered looting. If I give you more, others will get less. What do you say?"

"That's right, who knows if the numbers you reported are even true!"

"Why are you still quibbling, Sir Hutton, those Gold Royals never belonged to you in the first place."

"You should be grateful for what you're getting, look at your accomplices; they can only go to heaven to ask the gods for compensation."

Seeing the surrounding nobles staring at him angrily, he could only shrink back and bow, "Then let it be according to your standard, thank you for your kindness, Your Majesty."

"Very well," Grace smiled slightly, "Next."

"Greetings to you, Your Majesty." An elderly man with white hair stepped out of the crowd, respectfully placing a hand over his chest, his chest's Silver Heron family crest shining brightly.

"Marquis Bode, I remember that your territory was not attacked by the church's mob."



"Yes," he nodded in response, "it's not that they don't want to, but that they can't... The Impassable Mountain Range is easy to defend but hard to attack, and my knights have stopped the mob's invasion. Unfortunately, my child was not so lucky. On the day of the rebellion, he happened to be on duty at the palace, and in an attempt to protect the former queen, he was not only killed by the believers, but his body was also hung at the city gates. It wasn't until Your Majesty arrived at Everwinter that he was freed from this humiliation."



"What a tragic story," Grace feigned a sorrowful expression and sighed, "So what do you need me to do?"



"The man who killed him is called the Butcher, now the leader among the remaining rebels. These people are hiding in the mountains to the north, the Fertile Plains, and I want to seek vengeance for my child," the Marquis stated calmly.



"But I don't have many soldiers at my disposal. Aside from patrolling, guarding the city walls and granaries, it's hard to spare men to scour the wilderness for a hundred or so fugitive mobs," she shook her head in regret, "And once winter comes, with the heavy snow sealing the mountains, they will not receive supplies and will eventually freeze to death inside. Why the urgency?"



"Only by taking the life of the murderer with my own hands can I find peace, Your Majesty. I also don't need to trouble you to dispatch knights to search for the rebels. There are many natural caves at the foot of the mountains; they must be hiding there. However, most cave entrances are very narrow, and if we block them with rubble, even knights would find it difficult to attack inside. I hope you can provide me with the kind of alchemical substance that can blow up city gates, and I will handle the rest myself."



Snow powder? Grace frowned. This substance had great power and was a game-changer on the battlefield, something that absolutely could not be allowed to spread.



She was just about to refuse when the other party spoke again, "If you can agree to my request, I am willing to return to the court and serve you, and the Silver Loon family will fully support you in your rule over the Kingdom of Everwinter."



These words made Grace pause for a moment. When the church executed the queen, it also got rid of a batch of senior officials. Marquis Border was quite prestigious here, and if she could get him to serve as Prime Minister, gathering the remaining nobles together, it would to some extent alleviate the difficulties of administrative operation.



"This request is not excessive," she pondered for a moment and finally made a decision, "But I cannot give you the Alchemical Blasting Powder to use directly. When you need it, I will send a specialized alchemist to assist you in blowing open the cave entrance."



After the court meeting ended, Grace returned to the backroom, where Farrina came forward and handed her a cup of hot mulled wine. "You've worked hard, Your Majesty. Those nobles have indeed all turned towards you. In this way, even without relying on the Wolf King, you could slowly swallow up the entire Kingdom of Everwinter."



"If it weren't for the Church," the Queen shrugged.



The Church's move to deprive the nobility of their inheritance rights had pushed them all to her side. With the support of these people, coupled with the significant weakening of the former faction in power, it wasn't difficult to gain a firm foothold in the capital. However, taking control of Everwinter was still a long way off—the people here were greatly influenced by the Church, and the Black Sail warriors she sent to sweep through the churches in several other major cities had been attacked by civilians and believers. Therefore, forming an alliance with Wolfheart was extremely important. It would not only allow them to jointly resist the Church but also weaken the Church's influence by transferring populations.



As for those stubborn civilians, it would be best to just kill them all.



"By the way, the Wolf King has just sent a messenger with a letter for you," Farrina produced an envelope from her bosom. "Since you were dealing with state affairs at the time, I did not disturb you."



Grace opened the envelope, took out the letter, and unfolded it, her expression growing solemn.



"Is it bad news?"



"The Church has dispatched troops again," she said gravely. "They are advancing towards Wolfheart City by land and have already broken through several temporary defense lines."



"What?" Farryn couldn't believe his eyes, "The Evil Months are about to start, do they plan to ignore New Holy City?"



Grace sat back down at her desk, her brows furrowed in thought.



The church would never let things rest, but she hadn't expected them to act so quickly. If they waited until next spring to start the war, she would be much better prepared. The enemy clearly didn't want to give her any breathing space—if she ignored the Wolf King's plea for help and the Kingdom of Wolfheart were to fall, she wouldn't last long either.



However, this was also an opportunity.



If she could wear down the church's army in the city of Wolfheart, and then the demonic beasts massively invaded Hermes, the enemy would face a disaster of destruction.



They might send more God's Punishment Army, but she also possessed powerful weapons like the snow powder, along with the indomitable Styx black water, evil fire powder, and the towering walls of Wolfheart City, she would definitely be able to consume a large amount of the enemy's living forces.



Thinking of this, Grace spoke, "Pass on my orders, have the Black Sail warriors prepare to set out! This year, we shall spend winter in Wolfheart City."
