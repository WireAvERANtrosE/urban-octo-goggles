## The Horn of the Decisive Battle
In the palace hall of the Eternal Winter Kingdom, the fire in the fireplace was already burning fiercely.

Compared to the distinct seasons of Greycastle, the summer here was exceptionally short, and autumn felt more like a prelude to the impending cold, not even leaving enough time to change into light summer clothing before the chill wind would stealthily return.

Grace Wimbledon, draped in a fox fur coat, sat on the throne, listening to the complaints and requests of the nobles.

She disliked this palace; the columns, walls, and floors were all made of snow-white stone, each piece polished to a smooth, shining finish, looking just like solid ice. Even though she had added two layers of velvet cushions to her seat, she could still feel the bone-chilling cold emanating from the iron chair.

This damned house is like it's built of ice, she thought displeased. Once the situation stabilizes, the first thing to do would be to smash the floors and walls to pieces and then relay them with dark brown granite slabs.

"Your Majesty, I hope you can help me seek justice!"

A nobleman said, his face the picture of misery.

The fellow had been rambling on and on previously, when in fact, his situation could be explained in just a few sentences. Essentially, after the church occupied the capital, they conducted public trials against some nobles who had committed numerous wrongdoings. The presiding judge was Bishop Heather. Most people ended up on the gallows, but this man was lucky; he was only sentenced to have his property confiscated and distributed among the victimized commoners.

"I understand your request, private property should not be plundered," Grace pondered for a moment and then slowly spoke, "However, the exact amount is difficult to define. How about this, if you can provide the financial statements for the last five years, I can consider extracting a portion from the seized assets to compensate you."



"But, the mob has looted my estate clean, these records are probably..."

"Then I can only compensate you according to the standards set for a noble's rank, as per the published notice," Grace interrupted, "Look around you, they are all nobles who have suffered looting. If I give you more, others will receive less. What do you say?"

"Exactly, who knows if the numbers you reported are even true!"

"Why the fuss, Sir Hailong, those Gold royals never belonged to you in the first place."

"You should be glad you're getting anything at all, look at your cronies, they can only go to heaven to demand compensation from the gods."

Seeing the surrounding nobles glaring at him in anger, he could only bow timidly, "Then let it be as per Your Standard, thank you for your mercy, Your Majesty."

"Very well," Grace smiled faintly, "Next."

"Greetings, Your Majesty." An elderly man with white hair stepped out of the crowd, respectfully touching his chest, the silver egret crest on his chest gleaming brightly.

"Marquis Bode, I recall that your territory was not attacked by the church's rioters."



"Yes," he nodded, "it's not that they don't want to, but they can't... The Impassable Mountain Range is easy to defend and hard to attack, and my knights have blocked the invasion of the mob. However, my child was not so lucky. On the day of the riot, he happened to be on duty in the palace, and in order to protect the former queen, he was not only killed by the believers but also hung on the city gate. It was not until Your Majesty arrived at Everwinter that he was liberated from the humiliation."



"What a tragic story," Grace feigned a sorrowful expression and sighed, "So, what do you need me to do?"



"The man who killed him is called the Butcher, and he has now become the leader among the remaining rebels. These people are hiding in the mountains to the north, and I want to avenge my child," the Marquis stated calmly.



"But I don't have many soldiers at my disposal. Aside from patrolling, guarding the city walls and granaries, it is difficult to spare men to go into the wild mountains to search for about a hundred exiled rioters." She shook her head, expressing regret, "And once winter comes, the heavy snow seals the mountains, they will run out of supplies and sooner or later will freeze to death inside, why the urgency?"



"Only by killing the murderer with my own hands can I find peace, Your Majesty. I also don't need to trouble you to send out warriors to search for the rebels. There are many natural caves at the foot of the mountains, and they must be hiding there. However, most of the cave entrances are very narrow, and if blocked with rubble, even knights would find it difficult to break in. I hope you can provide me with that alchemical substance that can blow up city gates, and I'll take care of the rest myself."



He wants gunpowder? Grace frowned, this substance had great power, it was a game-changer on the battlefield, and absolutely could not be allowed to spread.



She was just about to refuse when the other party spoke again, "If you can agree to my request, I am willing to return to the court to serve you, and the Silver Pigeon family will also fully support your rule over the Kingdom of Everwinter."



These words made Grace pause for a moment. When the church executed the queen, they also wiped out a bunch of senior officials. The Marquis of Border Town was quite influential in this area. If he could be made Prime Minister in front of the court, gathering the remaining nobles together, it could to some extent alleviate the difficult situation of administrative operations.



"The request is not excessive," she pondered for a moment and finally made a decision, "But I cannot hand over the alchemical explosive powder directly for you to use. When you need it, I will send a dedicated alchemist to assist you in blowing open the entrance of the caves."



After the council meeting ended, Grace returned to the back room where Ferlin Eltek greeted her, handing her a cup of hot mulled wine. "You've worked hard, Your Majesty, those nobles have indeed all sided with you. With this, even without relying on the Wolf King, you could slowly swallow up the entire Kingdom of Everwinter."



"If it weren't for the Church," the Queen shrugged.



The Church's move to strip the nobility of their inheritance rights had pushed them all to her side. With the support of these people, plus the significant weakening of the past influential factions, it was not difficult to get a foothold in the capital. However, there was still a long way to go before she could control Everwinter—the people here were greatly influenced by the Church, and the Black Sail warriors she sent out to sweep the churches in other major cities had encountered attacks from civilians and believers. Therefore, forming an alliance with the Wolf Heart was extremely important; it would not only allow them to jointly resist the Church but also weaken the Church's influence by transporting populations.



As for those stubborn civilians, they could all be killed.



"By the way, the Wolf King just sent a messenger with a letter for you," Ferlin said as he pulled an envelope from his chest. "Since you were dealing with official affairs, I did not disturb you."



Grace opened the envelope, took out the letter, and unfolded it, her expression becoming grave.



"Is it bad news?"



"The Church has dispatched troops again," she said somberly. "They are moving towards Wolfheart City by land and have already broken through several temporary defensive lines."



"What?" Farrina couldn't believe her eyes, "The Evil Months are almost upon us, do they plan to just abandon the New Holy City?"



Grace sat back down at her desk, her brows furrowed in thought.



The Church would never let things end so easily, but she hadn't expected them to make their move so soon. If they waited until next spring to wage war, her preparations would be much more sufficient. The enemy clearly didn't want to give her a chance to catch her breath—if she ignored the Wolf King's plea for help and the Kingdom of Wolfheart was destroyed, she wouldn't last much longer either.



However, this was also an opportunity.



If she could exhaust the Church's army at the City of Wolfheart, and when the demonic beasts massively invade Hermes, the enemy would face a disaster of annihilation.



They might send more Punishment Army troops, but she also had powerful weapons like Snow Powder, the unquenchable dark waters of the Styx River, the Evil Fire Powder, and the towering walls of the City of Wolfheart. She could definitely deplete a large amount of the enemy's living forces.



Thinking of this, Grace spoke, "Send out my orders, have the Black Sail soldiers prepare for departure! This year, we will winter in the City of Wolfheart."
