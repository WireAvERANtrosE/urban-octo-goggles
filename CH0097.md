## New Witch, New Ability (Part 1)
Roland walked into the office and was surprised to find that it was not Nightingale inside, but Wendy.



"Is something the matter?" he asked as he poured himself a cup of warm water. "Where is Nightingale?"



"She's gone to welcome the sisters."



"Is that so," Roland said, picking up the cup and about to take a sip when he suddenly felt something was off, "Wait, what sisters?"



"The sisters from the Witch Cooperation Association. They've arrived in Border Town," Wendy replied.



"Weren't they supposed to be searching for the Holy Mountain?" he exclaimed, standing up abruptly. "How many people have come? And what about the one who wanted to harm Nightingale... the one called Snake Witch Cara, did she come as well?"



"No, Your Highness... they were unable to find the Holy Mountain. In the wilderness, they encountered terrible monsters, and in the end, only seven survived," Wendy repeated Leaf's account before bowing apologetically. "At the time, you were napping, please forgive me for taking the liberty of letting Nightingale and Lightning bring them back."



"It's fine," Roland waved his hand dismissively, "you know I wouldn't blame you for something like this. What kind of abilities do they have?"



"I'm not sure, but according to Leaf, none of them are combat witches. They might..." Wendy hesitated, "not be of much use to you."



"Non-combat types?" Roland's heart was immediately filled with anticipation. Under the constraints of the God's Punishment Stone and their effective range, witches' combat capabilities were actually quite limited, and production was their forte. If there were a witch who specialized in plasticity, he could solve the problem of rough processing techniques and enter directly into the era of mass mechanical production; if there were a witch capable of generating electricity, the nights in Border Town would be as bright as day. Next, he would ascend to the throne, marry a witch, reach the pinnacle of life, and lead everyone towards the realization of four modernizations. Just thinking about it was exciting.



"Your Highness, don't you need them..." Perhaps Wendy's concern arose from too much silence, as she asked in a low voice.



"No, how could I not," Roland snapped back to reality and said word by word, "I'll take as many of such witches as come."



Just as the sun set, Nightingale returned to the castle successfully with the remaining sisters of the Witch Cooperation Association, while Roland had prepared a sumptuous dinner in the castle hall as a feast to cleanse the dust of travel.



The witches were clearly famished, but since it was their first time dining in such an environment, everyone was rather restrained. For most of them, it was also their first time meeting a lord, let alone a prince.



Luckily, apart from Roland himself, there were Anna and Nana, two local witches, setting an example. With the addition of Lightning, who knew nothing of embarrassment and could liven up the atmosphere, everyone eventually relaxed a bit, and conversation began to flow at the banquet.



Roland was chewing on fried bread while looking over the group of women before him with great interest. They were all different in style but could all be considered beautiful. This was the greatness of magic— even if technology advanced to the point that witches were no longer needed, their appearance would still be an everlasting landscape.



The model community built by Karl was not yet complete, so the witches had to temporarily live in the castle. There were four vacant rooms left on the second floor, and after some consideration, Roland decided to change the single rooms into doubles. After all, those large beds were prepared for visiting nobles and could easily accommodate two people.



After the dinner concluded, the prince finally arrived at the long-awaited segment—the inquiry about abilities.



The witches entered the office in turn, accompanied by Nightingale, while Roland acted like an interviewer, jotting down each of their characteristics. For the first time, he also used the God's Punishment Stones to test the effectiveness of their abilities. The whole process was akin to a recruitment fair. After the last witch had been questioned, he let out a sigh of relief and stretched languidly. If he weren't afraid that Nightingale might be squatting nearby eavesdropping, he really wanted to hum "Superstar."



Even though he hadn't found witches specialized in shaping or generating electricity, meaning the progress towards modernization would have to slow down, this batch of witches still brought Roland plenty of surprises.



The most important of all was a witch named Leaf.



He spread out the parchment records on the table and pulled out the one about her.



Before reaching adulthood, Leaf's ability was limited to enhancing the fruits of plants. After coming of age, her ability greatly improved and developed a new branch: controlling plants.



The first ability could be used to improve fruits and seeds, increasing yield and enhancing the effects of herbs. The branching ability gave her the potential to alter the characteristics and traits of plants. According to her, by infusing magic into plants, she could make withered branches sprout green leaves, command weeds to entangle enemies, and even merge herself with a large tree.



However, the larger the plant, the more magic it consumed to control. Therefore, in combat, she preferred to use weeds as they took effect quickly and required less magic.



The method of using her ability was through physical contact and could be transmitted through a medium (such as the ground), with an effective range of about five meters.



There was no doubt that this witch, with her head of emerald green hair, was an excellent asset for developing agriculture—its importance was self-evident. Industrialization required a large population, and in turn, a large population depended on a sufficient food supply. This food had to be either produced locally or imported through trade. The former, without high-efficiency production, would only bind most of the labor force to the land. The latter was difficult to achieve in an era where transportation was extremely underdeveloped.



With the acquisition of a Druid, Roland now hoped to use a small number of farmers to feed a large number of industrial workers, accelerating the industrialization process of his territory.



Therefore, in the future direction of practice, he decided to have Leaf work on improving seeds, whether it was wheat or barley. As long as one of them could achieve increased yields, it would significantly raise the population limit his territory could accommodate. In addition, he heard that the Fjords produced some uniquely flavored foods, which, according to Lightning's description, seemed to be potatoes and corn. If the rumors were true, then the plan to introduce these two crops also needed to be scheduled as soon as possible. After all, wheat itself was not a high-yield crop.



After writing down the training plan, Roland put her information aside and pulled out a second piece of paper from the desk.



The second witch to be questioned was called Scroll, also the oldest among the seven, nearing forty this year.



This was a rare age among the witch community. The older one got, the harder it was to resist the backlash of magic power. However, seeing her ability description, Roland could understand why Scroll had survived to this point.



Her main ability was a memory far beyond ordinary people; after reaching adulthood, her ability stabilized and could almost be described as photographic memory. At the same time, she gained a very interesting branch ability: Scroll could turn books she had read into physical entities in a short period of time, which Roland named "Book of Magic."



Her main ability was almost always in effect, so each Day of Awakening, Scroll could pass safely, which was also the reason she, born into poverty, managed to become self-taught... This ability was of great help for learning, especially for the repetitive memory practice required for literacy. The branch ability exhausted all her magic power each time it was used, and the Book of Magic's existence time depended on the remaining magic power, generally between half a quarter of an hour to an hour.



Clearly, Scroll was a natural teacher. If education was to be popularized in the future, she could dominate all fields. Hmm... As for now, Roland thought, her ability did not need practice; it was better to keep her by his side for the time being. When he had some free time, he could write some elementary textbooks on mathematics and physics to teach her. When the time was right, she would shine in the field of education.
