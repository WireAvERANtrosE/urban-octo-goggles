## Ice Witch
Early the next morning, Agatha received a delicate parchment scroll from Roland's hands.

"What is this?"

"A contract. After you press your handprint, you will officially be a member of the Witch Union."

She unfolded the scroll and meticulously read through the contents, then said in surprise, "That's it?"

"Hm?" The other party seemed not quite to understand her point. "What do you mean?"

"The constraints are meaningless," Agatha pointed at the line that read 'Scope of Effectiveness,' "it only mentions not to betray Border Town without going against the mutual consensus of both parties, but there are no binding measures. If someone really wanted to betray, I doubt they would feel any psychological pressure. And the wording is too loose; is this really a contract?"

"Yes, I wrote it down off the top of my head; it's just a formality," the prince nodded, unsurprised. It seemed that Agatha was not the first to point out the flaws in the contract.

"A formality full of loopholes," she criticized inwardly, then poked the ink pad and pressed her handprint. The alliance contract demanded little from both parties, and according to its terms, she wouldn't feel much change after joining. Although it seemed somewhat superfluous, she also felt somewhat relieved.

She might say that she was cooperating with mortals, but in her heart, she was clear that this gray-haired man was the actual leader of the Witch Union. If she had to serve a mortal with the same respect as she would to the higher-ups of the Confederation or the lords of the Three Cities, she would find it difficult to accept. Now it seemed, at least, she retained a considerable amount of freedom.



Roland put away the sheepskin scroll and asked curiously, "What about the restrictions of contracts in Taquila?"

"That's only necessary when recruiting mortals. It includes everything from bodily punishment to mental torment," she curled her lips, "As for us, there's no need to sign such things. The Union is for life, and once you join, the only way out for a deserter is death."

"Alright," he took a breath, "Welcome to the Witch Union. Remember to come to the castle garden after breakfast, I need to test your abilities thoroughly."

...

The ability test was simpler than Agatha had imagined. She demonstrated each trait of her power in front of the prince and then answered a few of his questions, and it was over.

"The magic power form is a sky-blue pentagonal prism, with a moderate capacity for containment. The type is summoning, and the ability has evolved once. Initially, the effect was to create low temperatures, but after evolving, it can achieve solidification at room temperature, a very convenient ability," Roland recorded and then asked, "How did you manage to evolve your power?"

"Through constant practice and a sudden epiphany," she said proudly. As the youngest high-order awakened one at that time, everyone in the Union called her 'the prodigy of Taquila.' "Every day, I tried to lower the temperature further to freeze water rapidly. Until one day, I witnessed a witch who controlled flames melt a lead cake into liquid. As the flames continued to heat it, the molten lead began to boil."

"This sight made me realize that perhaps all things have three states: gas, liquid, and solid—lead is solid at room temperature, but if it's hot enough, it can turn into a gas; water is liquid at room temperature, but if it gets colder, it will solidify into ice."

"So, a gas that is gaseous at room temperature, could it also freeze like lead if the temperature is low enough?"



"Embracing this thought when using my ability, I quickly felt a completely different change in the magic power within my body, and eventually advanced to a high-order witch. This epiphany was also recorded in the 'Compendium of Laws and Spells.'"

In fact, she was the youngest person ever included in the book, and at that time, even the Three Chiefs praised her, believing that this insight was not only very enlightening for the advancement of witches but also of great significance for practical research. However, when she solemnly stated this, the other party remained quite calm.



"I see," the prince nodded, "What is the 'Compendium of Laws and Spells'?"



"Wait, you... aren't you surprised?" Agatha asked in astonishment, "This world is filled with gases everywhere. They seem elusive and weightless, but in reality, they can turn into flowing water or solid ice."



"That's quite normal. There are many types of gases, each with different boiling points and melting points," Roland shrugged, "Why should I be surprised? These things are considered common knowledge in 'The Basics of Natural Sciences.'"



"..." Agatha suddenly felt a tightness in her chest and took a few deep breaths, "Alright, I will study this book properly."



"So the 'Compendium of Laws and Spells'—"



"Is a record of all the realizations and processes of ability evolution for high-order awakeners," she said irritably, "But since the abilities of witches are different from one another, it's difficult to advance by imitating and referencing, certainly not as straightforward as your 'The Basics of Natural Sciences!'"



"Did I say something wrong?" the prince asked, puzzled.



"No, I was too arrogant," Agatha felt even more stifled in her heart.



"Ahem," perhaps noticing her discomfort, he changed the subject, "You just mentioned that each witch's ability is unique... Does that mean among the thousands of witches in the Union, there isn't a single one with duplicated abilities?"



"None," she replied stiffly, "The Quest Society believes that the form of magic determines the ability, but no two witches have exactly the same form of magic."



"But when you saw Anna before, you immediately thought she had a flame-related ability."



"That's just a simplistic classification for ease of understanding. Abilities that involve glowing and heating can all be classified as flame-related, but with the growth of magic power, maturity, and advancement, seemingly identical abilities will undergo great changes. Even in the initial stages of flame, some witches excel at controlling temperature, others have more intense flames, and some can project their flames. If differences aren't apparent, it's due to inadequate observation methods," Agatha explained, "The Quest Society's classification method is more formal and generally similar to your own."



"Also three categories?" Roland asked.



"Four, with the main difference being in the summoning type—The Quest Society has divided it into two kinds, one called mana and the other called shaping. You should be able to understand their differences from the names alone."



"Mana refers to the kind of summoning that Anna needs, which requires continuous consumption of magic power and disappears once the magic supply stops, while shaping is like the coating that Soraya draws, which can exist for a long time?"



"Although I don't know the specifics of Soraya's ability, that's roughly the idea... Anything that can exist for a long time can be considered a shaping summon, like my constant temperature solidification."



"Understood," Roland noted down this information as well, "That will be all for today's test. As usual, when I haven't assigned you a task, you're free to practice your abilities on your own. However, I think there's someone who might urgently need your help right now."

"Who?"

"The Chief Alchemist of Border Town, Kyle Sichi."
