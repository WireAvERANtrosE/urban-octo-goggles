## Bug's Stomach
"Tilly, you can't—" Ashes started to object but was interrupted.



"To enter the cave, we must rely on the witches with flying abilities to bring people out," Tilly wiggled the ring on her finger. "Although my magic power will deplete faster with the added weight, I can still carry an extra witch. This is crucial for the mission—having one more witch means we can handle more situations." She paused and looked at the witches from Border Town, "Anna, Lightning, Maggie, I need your help."



The three expressed no objections, and the little girl even looked eager to try.



Tilly breathed a sigh of relief, "So in addition to Ashes, Sylvie, and Hill, the rest of you sisters will take care of the ground entrance."



"Lady Tilly, let me accompany you," Andrea spoke up.



"If we encounter a pack of demonic beasts, Nightingale alone might not be able to handle them," she shook her head. "You and her can work together, one from afar and one up close."



"Don't worry, I will guard the exit for you," Nightingale appeared full of confidence. "Neither devils nor demonic beasts will be able to take a step near this place."



Tilly had thought it through clearly; the number of witches that could go down depended on the carrying capacity of the flying witches. The heaviest object was the "Ice Coffin," which, if it couldn't be awakened on the spot and had to be broken into pieces to be carried, would weigh at least as much as two to three witches. Only Sylvie's invisible barrier could lift such a heavy object.



Sylvie's Magic Eyes were indispensable; without her, they couldn't even find the precise location of the ruins inside the monster's belly. Anna's cutting and heating abilities were equally essential, but neither of them could fly. Fortunately, they were lighter, and Maggie could carry them after transforming into a magic bird. Lastly, there was Ashes, the Extraordinary who could remain stable in any situation, whom she would carry herself.



Lightning, despite her ability to fly, claimed that once she carried someone, her altitude would drop significantly and she feared she wouldn't be able to fly out of this deep cave. Her strengths lay in her exceptional agility and speed, which made her effective for alert, reconnaissance, and pincer movements.

The importance of these witches was almost irreplaceable; the absence of even one would make things extremely difficult. Therefore, her decision to go down was not an impulsive one but was made after full consideration.

As for Andrea... her destructive power at close range was extremely impressive, but once she encountered narrow areas where one could not see their own hands, her abilities would be greatly reduced. It was better for her to stay on the ground with Nightingale, guarding against the evil beasts lurking nearby.

Tilly had considered abandoning the rescue and simply returning home. However, she had an uneasy premonition – why was the surrounding area intact, yet this stone tower ruin was specifically targeted? Especially the direction in which the giant beast crawled—she looked toward the northwestern mountains, beyond which lay the Devil's domain.

Could there be a connection between the two?

The hot air balloon, controlled by Wendy and Anna, landed steadily. Tilly cast aside the miscellaneous thoughts in her head, reviewed the plan once more, took a deep breath, and said word by word, "We set off."

...

The pit was deeper than she had anticipated, about two stories high inside. It started as a straight drop and soon began to slope, eventually forming a horizontal passage. The soil around emitted an unpleasant odor, and upon closer inspection, one could see a sticky liquid dripping on the surface of the soil, reminiscent of the wet traces left by a slug's passage.

As the group continued deeper, the light from the entrance quickly disappeared, and the entire bottom of the cave, aside from the faint light from a few torches, was engulfed in darkness. Not only that, but the howling of the wind also ceased, and the cold was gradually replaced by geothermal heat, warming Tilly's body.



Gazing at the flickering lights that seemed to come and go, she couldn't help but think of fireflies.

"The beast is right ahead," Sylvie whispered just then.

But there was no need for her reminder; everyone was aware that they were getting close to their target—the depths of the cave echoed with strange sounds, somewhat like the rustling of autumn wind through the forest, yet also resembling the crunching of chewing.



"Descend." She had Ashes behind her wave the torches a couple of times before controlling the magic stone to lower their altitude until their feet touched the soft, sticky mud.



Then, Anna's cold light shone forth.

She transformed the Blackfire back into Heartfire, and instantly, a cold yet gentle light flooded the surroundings. Under the greenish glow, the witches could clearly see the tail of the beast. It crawled slowly forward, its wriggling gray skin constantly secreting a slimy substance, making the stench of decay even stronger.



"A disgusting big bug," Ashes drew her greatsword, "What's next, cut open its belly?"



"Wait, Anna has to be the one to kill it," Tilly shook her head, "I don't know if whatever's inside its belly poses a threat to us; getting close and swinging your sword is too risky."



"Mm, let me try." While keeping the green fire burning, Anna summoned another ball of Blackfire—In the blink of an eye, the Blackfire turned into a thin line as thick as a finger, shooting straight towards the beast.



The thin line effortlessly pierced through the monster's skin and sliced toward its belly. Perhaps due to the high temperature, the skin touched by the black line instantly ignited, and the liquid inside vaporized, spewing out billowing white steam. Prepared for this, Sylvie propped up an invisible shield, blocking the splattering juices.



This is the power of evolution, Tilly thought to herself. Although Anna had introduced her ability before setting off, actually witnessing it still shocked her. The ability to act independently of one's physical body, the black fire that could become as fine as a thread was sharper than any greatsword, and it was extremely difficult to observe its trajectory, leaving the enemy no chance to dodge.



The monster let out a sharp, pitiful wail and its body writhed wildly. But the black fire continued to slice forward relentlessly, quickly mashing up a large portion of its corpulent body. The flowing liquids didn't even get close to the witches before another ball of green fire evaporated them completely.



Gradually, the beast stopped struggling, and its skin slackened.



"It's dead," said Sylvie, "Its heart has stopped beating."



"This thing had a heart?" Ashes asked, pinching her nose.



"In its head, about the size of the Observation Balloon. And..." she paused, "there is magical power flowing in its body."



"So you're saying, this is a hybrid demonic beast?"



"No one knows the answer," Tilly said, "The historical records regarding demonic beasts and the barbaric lands are scarce. There's too much unknown here; we better hurry up and dig out the ice coffin."



After another incineration by Anna, the foul smell was no longer as intense as before. With Sylvie's guidance, they quickly found the remnants of what had been devoured—of course, the basement was now just a heap of broken stones, and it was impossible to discern its original form. The glowing magic stones that Lightning had mentioned had mostly turned into mushy lumps. Fortunately, the transparent crystalline columns were still intact. After being flipped out from the sticky innards, not a trace of corrosion was found on them, and the woman sealed within the crystal was still as lifelike as ever.

"It's all up to you now," Tilly said to Anna.
