## Hidden Answer
When Roland returned to the castle, it was already late, and the snow outside had intensified.



He entered the bedroom, took off his coat, shook off the snow that had accumulated on the collar, and hung it on the clothes rack by the fireplace.



"Your Highness, don't you think this matter was dealt with too hastily?" Nightingale revealed herself in front of the prince.



"Nana?" Roland poured a cup of wine for himself and for her, even though this barley wine was much more bitter than the beer from later times, he had gradually grown accustomed to its taste.



Nightingale took the cup and held it in her hands without drinking—she was waiting for the prince's answer.



"There's no more appropriate time than now," Roland downed his drink in one gulp and refilled his cup, "If we want to make full use of Nana's abilities during the Evil Months, it's impossible to keep hiding the identity of a witch. The ability to instantly heal injuries that could be fatal is definitely not something that can be achieved with ordinary herbs or bloodletting therapy, which is something everyone can think of."



"Thanks to this town located beyond the western border, which is of little significance itself, the Church's influence here is very limited—if I were them, I wouldn't want to waste Gold royals on a place that could be abandoned at any moment," Roland continued, "The town doesn't even have a small chapel, and the missionaries left early along with the nobles back to Longsong Stronghold. What do you think Border Town looks like right now? An isolated island that has lost contact with the outside world."



"...Was this something you had planned all along?" Nightingale asked.



Roland nodded, "The heavy snowfall will bury the roads leading to Longsong Stronghold, and the dock's shipping is under my control. We have at least three months to reverse the notion that 'witches are evil.' Propaganda alone is very limited in effect; we must rely on close contact to quickly eliminate this misunderstanding."

That's why he wanted to keep Nana by all means. He wanted to create a different world version of Florence Nightingale.

This legendary nurse, by diligently caring for the wounded, managed to reduce the mortality rate from 42% to 2%, and as a result, was venerated by the soldiers as the Goddess with the Lamp, elevating the entire nursing profession to a worshiped status.

And Nana's abilities were even more miraculous, healing injuries through magic. As long as one didn't die on the spot, their life could be saved. This was probably more effective in boosting the morale of the militia than any weapon.

At the same time, thanks to her father being a declining noble, who regularly dealt with hunters and farmers, he was very amiable towards the commoners and even allowed Nana to attend the academy run by Teacher Karl. If it were any other nobility, even those with the lowest rank of baronet, they would not willingly associate their daughter with these people—in their eyes, these were the so-called lowly commoners.

"Can this really be done?" Even Nightingale, when facing such a behemoth as the Church, felt particularly powerless.

"If we don't take this step, we will never know the answer."

Roland did not expect the entire town to change their views because of this, but at least he wanted to firmly hold this new team he had formed in his hands, and later rely on these seeds from within the people to spread his own ideas.

Three months was enough time to change many things.



Nightingale was silent for a moment before she spoke softly, "Why are you doing so much for the witches?"



To liberate productive forces, to gain more powerful strength, to have a place in the future struggle for the throne—of course, these answers were not suitable to be said at this time. Although Roland was a mechanical dog who had played plenty of GALGAME, he could be considered battle-hardened and well-versed. His experiences from two lifetimes, spanning more than twenty years, reminded him that he was facing a critical question.



He pondered his words and then slowly said, "Haven't I told you before? In Border Town, we don't care about one's background. I hope that one day, even witches can live as free people in my territory."



This time, Nightingale's silence lasted longer, and the only sound in the room was the crackling of the burning charcoal. Her profile, illuminated by the flickering firelight, was like a stunning painting.



When she spoke again, Roland felt as if time had started to flow once more, "You really don't have to go to such lengths," her voice was distant and gentle, "Please forgive me for lying to you before... The sisters of the Witch Cooperation Association have been wandering for too long; they don't have many extravagant hopes, just a place where they can feel content, even if it's in this castle."



"What's the difference between that and a cage," Roland shook his head, then suddenly, as if realizing something, he widened his eyes and looked at Nightingale, "Wait... are you saying, you are willing to bring them here?"



Nightingale sighed and avoided the prince's gaze, "By doing so, you will make an enemy of the Church."



"Their reach has extended too far," Roland said unconcernedly, "Once the slogan 'divine right of kings' is declared, conflict between the Church and the nations of the continent is only a matter of time. As for Border Town, as long as we get through these three months smoothly, there's not much they can do. This place is a thousand miles away from the Church's stronghold. Will the bishop bring an army of inquisitors to traverse the entire Greycastle to attack me? My father would never allow such a thing to happen; it would be a serious provocation to the royal dignity."



After Nightingale curtsied and left, Roland lay down on the bed and took a deep breath.



There were some things he had not fully expressed. The Church was thousands of miles away, and given the speed at which news spread in this world, they would probably only start to react after the end of spring. Moreover, considering the long distance and his status as a prince, it was most likely that they would send an envoy to investigate the situation.



Back and forth, it would probably take half a year. By that time, he should have the strength to break with them.



Therefore, the greatest hidden danger did not come from the Church, but from the witches themselves.



This was something only Roland could see.



Although the witches were at a disadvantage now, this situation would not last forever. Witches did not depend on bloodline inheritance but were randomly awakened without any discernible pattern, which meant that witches could never be completely eradicated; they would only grow in numbers.



The Church relied on the God's Punishment Stones to maintain their advantage over witches, but this advantage could only be used to counteract magic power. For now, the awakening of witches not only granted them a variety of abilities but also led to a trend where their physical fitness, mental reactions, and even appearance surpassed that of ordinary people.



Essentially, they could be considered "new humans."



The more brutal the oppression, the more intense the resistance. What kind of destruction would a revolt led purely by witches bring to Greycastle? The hatred bred by the Church, once out of control, could very likely transform into indiscriminate hatred toward all the citizens of the kingdom.



Roland did not wish to see such a situation occur.

Therefore, he needed to start from Border Town, to construct a framework that could accommodate both parties, and to extend it to the entire Greycastle, and even to the kingdoms of the continent.

A world where witches and common people could coexist in harmony.
