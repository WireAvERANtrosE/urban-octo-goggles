## A once in a thousand years opportunity
Roland pushed open the door of the office, where Barov had been waiting for a long time.

He tossed the documents to the Minister Assistant and lay straight back on the recliner, propping his feet up on the desk.

If there wasn't an outsider present, he really would have liked to hum a tune.

"Your Highness, please accept my condolences," Barov quickly finished reading the documents and frowned, "The king's unfortunate death and the perpetrator being the First Prince is truly a tragedy. I wonder what your plans are moving forward."

"The death of King Herman is too bizarre. I want to see what my third sister and fifth sister decide before making plans," Roland said, "But regardless, there are some things we should prevent in advance."

Barov looked at the prince, waiting for him to continue.

"The capital might become unstable due to this change of royal power. The first thing to do is to move your families and relatives away." Of course, more importantly, to avoid the Second Prince using these people to threaten his own subordinates. For the time being, maintaining the normal operation of administration and finance in Border Town is indispensable, and the Minister Assistant is essential. Roland sipped his tea and continued, "You and Carter, as well as your subordinates, all write a letter to your families. I will entrust the royal guards to carry them to the capital and arrange for them to temporarily take refuge in other towns."

"There's no need to come to Border Town?" Barov was no fool; his more than twenty years of political experience made him immediately understand the prince's profound intentions.

"No need," Roland did not wish to have his subordinates threatened by their families, nor did he want his subordinates to think that he was threatening them with their families. Thus, he chose a compromise, to first settle them in other, safer towns. Later, once Border Town was on stable footing, they could be moved there.



"I understand, thank you for your concern, Your Highness," the Minister's Assistant nodded in agreement, which allowed Roland to breathe a sigh of relief. After all, there were too few capable people under his command.



"Additionally, regarding the mineral trade, we will temporarily halt the export of iron ore and only sell raw gemstones to Willow Town," he instructed, "I need to keep these iron ores for our own use."



"That will cause a decrease in fiscal revenue, Your Highness."



"But not by much. The miners have discovered a new gemstone deposit, which can make up for some of the shortfall," Roland said. Moreover, business was usually slow in the winter anyway. People were reluctant to travel and trade on days when demonic beasts might appear, and over the long four months, there might be only two or three rounds of trade. For the light and nimble single-masted sailboats, transporting raw gemstones was clearly the more profitable option.



"I understand," Barov noted down his orders.



After the Minister's Assistant left, Roland called for Carter Lannis, "I need to expand the size of the militia, and after the recruitment notice is issued, you'll arrange it. Select a few members who are quick to react and capable to serve as captains in the new teams. The training should follow the method we implemented last time."



"Your Highness, if we use the same training method as before, it might take a long time for the new teams to be ready for action."



"That's still better than a motley crew," Roland waved his hand, indicating for him to proceed as instructed. Even though the troops trained in this way were far from being considered an army, probably only on the level of college students after military training, sometimes combat strength had to be compared to the opponent. Apart from the brainless demonic beasts, the most likely opponents he would face were a 'mixed army' cobbled together from private armies, mercenaries, and serfs. With equipment from a different era, even college-student level troops should be able to handle it.



After Carter also left, Roland couldn't help but laugh.



He had not expected such a coincidence to occur! It was like sending charcoal in snowy weather or offering a pillow to someone dozing off.



Was this bad news for him? A dilemma? Absolutely not! He didn't know much about Grace Wimbledon, but she was certainly not someone who would let herself be slaughtered. The fact that the eldest prince was sentenced to death so swiftly, even without any hidden machinations, meant she was unlikely to return to the capital anytime soon.



All he needed to do was follow through with the plan. As long as he stayed put in Border Town, someone was bound to jump outâ€”and Duke Ryan was very likely to be the first one who couldn't sit still. Otherwise, he wouldn't have sent the recall order to him with such urgency in this dreadful weather.



The Duke hoped he would see it sooner rather than later, so as to be restless day and night.



If he chose to stay in Border Town, it would be tantamount to defying the will of the new king. Once the Evil Months were over, the Duke would most likely come under Timothy Wimbledon's banner to give him a profound lesson. And that was exactly what Roland needed.



If one were to ask what industrialization lacked the most, the answer would undoubtedly be people.



It required a large number of people to be thrown into this massive scale of production, turning individuals into cogs that would drive this immense machine. It is no exaggeration to say that England laid the profound foundation for the subsequent Industrial Revolution by driving a large number of farmers off the land through the "enclosure movement," turning them into free laborers.



The industrial age was so brutal; by continuously feeding the furnace with educated workers, it would yield rich returns. The more detailed the industrial classification, the more the required population would multiply.



What had been troubling Roland all along was the population issue.



Border Town has a total of over two thousand residents, and even with the machinery of the new era, production is still workshop-style. Without a large number of available workers, many projects cannot be launched. But from where could he steal, deceive, or coerce so many people to come?



Buy slaves? Not to mention where one could buy thousands of slaves at once, adult slaves are expensive, and they no longer have much potential to be cultivated. Slaves under ten years of age take too long to train, and even if he unscrupulously employed child labor, it would still be years before they could work.



Recruit talent? How many people would be attracted to such a remote place? And the cost would be even greater than buying slaves.



Encourage childbirth? Enforce marriage? Forget it...



He had not overlooked Longsong Stronghold, but with the kingdom in a stable state, for him to act against the neighboring lords would be tantamount to joking about his future. And Duke Lion likewise did not dare to target him openly, only able to set traps in secret.



But now it was different. After Timothy ascended to the throne, he was eager for all his rivals to disappear, which was evident from the urgency of his recall order. Duke Lion could clearly see this as well, and once the restraint of the old king was gone, it would be strange if he, as the ruler of the Western Territory, did not do something.



This was the opportunity Roland had been waiting for.



Longsong Stronghold, as a frontier of the kingdom and a key town with a hundred years of operation, has nearly ten thousand permanent residents. And beyond the stronghold, there are vast lands and towns without any defenses. If he could defeat the Duke of the stronghold and take the city, he would gain a large number of free citizens and at the same time complete the initial accumulation of wealth.



What could be easier than annexation to acquire population? What could be faster than plundering to accumulate wealth?



This news was like a lighthouse dispersing the fog, illuminating the path forward for Roland.

He would definitely not let go of such a rare opportunity.
