## Lucia
Ling's condition stabilized.



Just like the odd arrangement when they first boarded the ship, the mercenaries carrying wooden guns divided everyone into several groups. Those with critical injuries and open wounds were carried into the strange wooden hut first for treatment. Then, it was the turn of the young, families with children, and the adults, in that order.



Lucia and Ling were at the very front—the entire treatment process was incredibly fast. With her eyes covered, she held her sister and walked into the cabin with the help of the mercenaries. She did not have to wait long before someone placed a small pill in her hand. The pill was tiny, slightly sweet, and the person even took the initiative to tell her that her sister's medicine had been administered by them, so she did not have to worry.



After leaving the room and taking off her hood, Lucia was surprised to see Ling's complexion visibly improving. Although she was still unconscious, her forehead was no longer burning up, the flush on her face had faded, and the black spots had disappeared without a trace.



When everyone was freed from the fear of death and reborn, they were almost too excited to contain themselves. They all knelt down and cheered towards the gray-haired man in the distance, showing him the highest respect. From the mercenaries, they learned that he was the lord of the land, the ruler of the Western Region, His Highness Prince Roland Wimbledon.



It was just like the rumors had said. The lord not only lit a bonfire by the dock to cook and distribute meat porridge to everyone but also told them that as long as they were willing to work for the town, they could obtain wages, food, and shelter. While enjoying the fragrant meat porridge, everyone discussed animatedly. They all said how fortunate they were to have boarded the ship heading to the Western Region and praised His Highness for his kindness.



Only Lucia felt a tinge of anxiety.



How was she going to get in touch with the Witch Cooperation Association? The message that had been secretly circulating only mentioned that a group of witches had stayed in Border Town, but it did not explain how to find them—it was likely that important details had been lost during the transmission. She vaguely heard that the message had come from a major city in the central part of the kingdom.



Just as everyone was filling their stomachs and being led by the mercenaries towards the wooden sheds by the river, a woman's voice suddenly appeared behind Lucia.



"Are you looking for us?"

She was startled and jumped forward two steps while turning around, ready to run away. However, when the figure of the newcomer caught her eye, Lucia stood frozen in place.

My goodness, what a beautiful woman she was, with long curly hair that emitted a soft orange glow in the flickering firelight, eyes bright as stars, and a sweet smile on her lips. Most striking was the aura she exuded, her presence no less than that of any noble, as if she herself was an important personage.

"My name is Nightingale, I am a witch, welcome to the Western Border Town."

This feeling made Lucia involuntarily lower her head, "My... my name is Lucia White, and I want to join you."

"Then follow me," Nightingale smiled slightly, "I'll take you home."

By this time, the sun had already set behind the mountains, and only a faint light remained in the sky. Lucia, carrying the sleeping Lily, slowly followed behind her.

"When did you awaken?" she asked.

"Awaken?" Lucia was taken aback.



"It's the moment when you become a witch," Nightingale explained, "From then on, your body will continuously gather magic power. We call this transformation awakening."

"I think... it was probably two years ago," Lucia recalled, "Is magic power the same as the demonic power?"

"That's just the Church's rhetoric," she shook her head, "Magic power is a gift from the heavens to us, unrelated to good and evil, righteousness and wickedness. The so-called demonic bite is just the backlash on the body when it's filled with magic power. It can be avoided by practicing our abilities."

"We don't have to endure that kind of pain?" Lucia's eyes widened.

"That's right, if it weren't for the Church's oppression, witches wouldn't have to suffer from the backlash at all." Nightingale blinked, "And this is our home where we can freely use our abilities." She pointed behind her, "Is this cute little fellow your sister? What about your other family members?"

"They're all dead, only me and Lily escaped," Lucia fell silent for a moment, "A group of people attacked the city of Valencia, pillaging and slaughtering everywhere. My father tried to resist them and was... stabbed through the chest by several swords. My mother told us to run, and then she also... also..." A long-suppressed sorrow welled up in her heart, making it impossible for her to finish her sentence. The hardships, hunger, and fear she endured along the way all turned into grievances bursting forth. She had been stubbornly holding on for her sister's sake, but the defensive wall she had built in her heart seemed unable to hold back the violently fluctuating thoughts any longer. Her sobbing quickly turned into loud crying; she knew it wasn't proper, that she should maintain manners when meeting someone for the first time, but her tears were like a storm that couldn't be stopped.

She must be disliked by the other party now, right? She felt her tears and snot blending together, her mouth full of saltiness. However, contrary to Lucia's expectations, a pair of arms wrapped around her, pulling her into a warm embrace. The other person gently patted the back of her head, not minding the mess of tears on her face, and softly comforted her, "Cry, it's okay to cry it out."

...

When Lucia's emotions finally stabilized and she lifted her head, she saw that the other person's shoulder was wet with her tears.



"Yes, sorry..." she said with a flushed face.



"It's alright, are you feeling better now?" Nightingale pulled out a handkerchief to wipe her face and lifted Belle with one arm, leading her with the other. "Let's go, there are many sisters waiting for you."



Lucia had originally thought that the witches' residence would be in some inconspicuous abandoned warehouse or basement. She never expected Nightingale to bring her into the castle district—wasn't this the lord's private domain? What surprised her even more was that the guards not only didn't stop her, they even waved and saluted her.



Had the Mutual Aid Society taken control of the entire town?



And when she went up to the third floor of the castle and entered a brightly lit room, she was stunned to find the man sitting across from her was none other than the lord who had received the people's cheers earlier.



"This is the leader of the Witch Union, Prince Roland Wimbledon. He has taken in the surviving witches of the Mutual Aid Society and has spread the message to other cities, hoping to attract more homeless sisters," Nightingale introduced, "And this town is the homeland for the witches. You don't have to doubt this, because the one who treated your sister earlier and all the sick on the ship were witches."



Lucia's mind went blank, she had never imagined that there would be a noble willing to shelter witches, instead of treating them as tools or slaves. It wasn't until she came back to her senses that she hastily bent over to curtsy, her awkward and strange posture making Nightingale unable to suppress her laughter, "It's alright, His Highness doesn't mind these formalities."



"Did you come from the Eastern Region?" the lord's voice was calm and relaxed, not like an interrogation but more like a casual conversation.



Lucia stole a glance at him, only to see him leaning casually in his chair, looking interested.



"Yes..."

As the conversation deepened and Nightingale supplemented with explanations, her mood gradually relaxed. Although the other party was a noble, he didn't have an overbearing attitude, but rather seemed like an elder who cared about her.



"So it is, awakened for two years and still not of age..." He said with interest, "Then, what is your ability?"



"To restore an object to its original form," Lucia hesitated, "but it doesn't work on everything."



"Its original form?" His Highness stroked his chin and pushed a beautiful cup to the front of the table, "Can you show me?"



"It will destroy it."



"That's alright."



Lucia nodded, walked to the side of the table, and placed her hand above the cup.



In a short while, the cup began to shrink and deform, eventually turning into three completely different substances: on the left was something that looked like a puddle of oil, black and sticky; in the middle was a small clump of black powder, and on the right was a puddle of clear water, slowly dripping down the table.
