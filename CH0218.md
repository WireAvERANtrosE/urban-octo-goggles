## Lucia
Ling's condition stabilized.



Just like the strange arrangements made when they first boarded the ship, the mercenaries carrying wooden rifles divided everyone into several groups. Those who were seriously injured with open wounds and critical conditions were carried into the strange wooden hut for treatment first, followed by the young, families with children, and then the adults in order.



Lucia and Ling were among the first in line—the entire treatment process was very fast. With her eyes covered, she held her sister and was assisted into the cabin by the mercenaries. It wasn't long before someone put a small pill in her hand. The pill was tiny and slightly sweet, and the person even took the initiative to tell her that her sister's medicine had already been administered by them, so she needn't worry.



When she walked out of the room and took off her hood, she was surprised to see that Ling's complexion was visibly improving. Although still unconscious, her forehead was no longer burning hot, the flush on her face had faded, and the black spots had disappeared without a trace.



When everyone was freed from the fear of impending death and felt reborn, they were almost too excited to contain themselves. They knelt down and cheered towards the grey-haired man in the distance, paying him the highest respect. From the mercenaries, they learned that he was the lord of the land, the holder of the Western Region, His Highness, Roland Wimbledon.



What followed was exactly as the rumors had described. Not only did the lord start a bonfire by the dock and distribute meat porridge to everyone, but he also told them that as long as they were willing to work for the town, they could receive wages, food, and a place to live. As everyone enjoyed the fragrant meat porridge, there was a buzz of conversation, all saying how fortunate they were to have boarded the ship to the Western Region and praising His Highness for his kindness.



Only Lucia felt a twinge of anxiety.



How exactly was she supposed to contact the Mutual Aid Society? The message that had been secretly circulating only mentioned that a group of witches remained in Border Town, but it didn't specify how to find them—it was likely that important details had been lost during its spread. She vaguely heard that the message had come from a large city in the middle of the kingdom.



Just as everyone had their fill and was being guided by the mercenaries towards the wooden shacks by the river, a woman's voice suddenly appeared behind Lucia.



"Are you looking for us?"

She was startled and jumped forward two steps while turning around, ready to run away. However, when she saw the person approaching, Lucia couldn't help but stand frozen in place.

My God, what a beautiful woman she was, her long curly hair glinting with a soft orange light in the flickering fire, her eyes bright as stars, and a sweet smile on her lips. What stood out the most was her aura, no less distinguished than any noble, as if she was a personage of great importance.

"My name is Nightingale. I am a witch. Welcome to Border Town."

This feeling made Lucia involuntarily lower her head, "My... my name is Lucia White, and I want to join you."

"Then follow me," Nightingale said with a slight smile, "I'll take you home."

The sun had already set behind the mountains, and only a faint light remained in the sky. Lucia, carrying the sleeping Bell, slowly followed behind her.

"When did you awaken?" she asked.

"Awaken?" Lucia was taken aback.



"It's the moment of becoming a witch," Nightingale explained, "From that moment on, magic power will continuously accumulate inside your body. We call this transformation an awakening."

"I think... it was about two years ago," Lucia recalled, "Is magic power the same as the evil power of demons?"

"That's just what the Church claims," she shook her head, "Magic power is a gift from the heavens, it has nothing to do with good or evil. The so-called 'Devouring by Demons' is just the backlash of magic power building up in the body, which can be avoided by practicing and controlling one's abilities."

"Can we avoid that kind of pain?" Lucia's eyes widened.

"Yes, if it weren't for the oppression of the Church, witches wouldn't have to suffer from the backlash at all." Nightingale winked, "And this is our home, where we can freely use our abilities." She pointed behind her, "Is this cute little one your sister? What about the rest of your family?"

"They all died, only Linger and I escaped," Lucia fell silent for a moment, "A group of people attacked Golden City, burning, killing, and looting everywhere. My father tried to resist them and was... pierced through the chest by several swords. My mother told us to run, and then she too..." Overwhelmed by grief long suppressed, she could not finish her words. The hardships, hunger, and fear she endured all along turned into a burst of grievance. She had gritted her teeth and persevered for her sister's sake, but the defenses she had built in her heart seemed unable to hold back the surging thoughts any longer. Her sobbing quickly turned into loud crying. She knew it wasn't proper, that she should maintain decorum upon a first meeting, but her tears were like a storm that couldn't be stopped.

She feared she would be disliked for this. She felt her tears and snot mix together, tasting the saltiness in her mouth. However, to Lucia's surprise, a pair of arms wrapped around her, pulling her into a warm embrace. The other person gently patted the back of her head, not minding the messy dirt streaked by tears on her face, and softly comforted her, "Cry, it's alright to let it out."

...

When Lucia's emotions finally calmed down and she lifted her head, she saw that her tears had soaked a patch on the shoulder of the other person.



"Yes, sorry..." she said with a flushed face.



"It's okay, do you feel better?" Nightingale took out a handkerchief to wipe her face and lifted Anna with one hand, while holding her with the other, "Let's go, many sisters are waiting for you."



Lucia had thought that the witches' residence would be in some inconspicuous abandoned warehouse or basement, but to her surprise, Nightingale led her into the castle district—wasn't this the personal domain of the lord? What astonished her even more was that the guards did not stop her but instead waved to her in greeting.



Could it be that the Witch Union had taken control of the entire town?



Upon reaching the third floor of the castle and entering a brightly lit room, she was shocked to find that the man sitting across from her was none other than the lord who had received the cheers of the people earlier.



"This is the leader of the Witch Union, Prince Roland Wimbledon. He has sheltered the surviving witches of the Witch Union and spread the message to other cities, hoping to gather more sisters who have nowhere to turn," Nightingale explained, "And this town is now the witches' home. You need not doubt this, for the one who treated your sister and all the patients on the ship are witches."



Lucia's mind went blank; she never imagined that there would be nobles willing to shelter witches instead of treating them as tools or slaves. It wasn't until she came back to her senses that she hastily bowed in an awkward and strange posture, causing Nightingale to laugh, "It's okay, His Highness does not mind such formalities."



"Did you come from the Eastern Region?" The lord's voice was calm and relaxed, more like casual conversation than an interrogation.



Lucia sneaked a glance at him and saw that he was leaning casually on his chair, his expression filled with interest.



"Yes..."

As the conversation deepened and Nightingale provided explanations by her side, her mood gradually relaxed. Although the other party was a noble, he didn't have an overbearing attitude, but instead seemed like an elder who cared about her.

"I see, awakened for two years, and still not of age..." he said with interest. "So, what is your ability?"

"To restore an object to its original state," Lucia hesitated, "but it doesn't work on everything."

"Its original state?" His Highness stroked his chin and pushed a beautiful cup to the front of the table. "Can you show me?"

"It will destroy it."

"That's alright."

Lucia nodded, walked to the table, and placed her hand above the cup.

In a moment, the cup began to shrink and deform, eventually separating into three distinctly different substances: on the left appeared something like a pool of oil, black and thick, in the middle was a small clump of black powder, and on the right was a puddle of clear water, slowly dripping down the surface of the table.
