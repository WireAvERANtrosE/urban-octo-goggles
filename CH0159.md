## The most powerful persuasion
Before meeting the new witch, Roland had already received a detailed report from Tassa. 
He had not expected that the long-missing Tilly Wimbledon would become the leader of another witch organization, and moreover, she had managed to gather most of the witches within the kingdom of Greycastle before he did. What was even more intolerable was that she was now trying to extend her reach into his own territory.
Nightingale had mentioned that the witch before him was an extraordinary being, and her abilities were likely combat-oriented.
Any extraordinary being warranted caution, so when Roland received Ashes in his office, not only was the invisible Nightingale by his side, but Anna was also standing there. In front of the desk, several extremely thin black fires formed an imperceptible wall to the naked eye. If she dared to make a move, these thin lines would slice her into several pieces.
Strengthening type witches without the Divine Stone of Judgement did not have an advantage in witch conflicts, but once they wore the stone, they possessed unrestricted destructive power. Fortunately, the Divine Stone was loathed by most witches, and probably considering this, Ashes did not bring any of the Church's signature items when she came to Border Town to recruit witches.
"Your witches? Don't be arrogant. They are living people, not your private property!" Ashes said coldly.
Roland was suddenly at a loss for words, experiencing for the first time since his transmigration the awkwardness of a verbal defeat. He was used to saying 'my subjects' or 'my people' but now, unexpectedly criticized by democratic rhetoric, he was extremely embarrassed. Although it was common for a lord to refer to the people or things of his territory in such a way during this era, emphasizing this point in front of Nightingale and Anna was simply a lack of emotional intelligence, and he had fallen into the trap set by the other party.
So, he coughed twice, conceding gracefully, "I've never thought of it that way. They stay in the town of their own free will, and I believe that this is the best place for them. As for the Fjords you mentioned, let alone the fact that the sea voyage itself is very dangerous, the climate of the Fjords is unpredictable, constantly plagued by storms and tsunamis. It's not a suitable place to live at all."
"But at least there, the Church's power is negligible. Witches can use their own power to transform their homeland, to fight against natural disasters, but they have no way to fight against the Church with the Divine Stone of Judgement, not to mention the God's Punishment Army," Ashes said mercilessly. "Do you realize how foolish what you have done is? The messages you spread will only attract the Church to come knocking. Forgive my bluntness, but you simply cannot fight the God's Punishment Army. The correct way to avoid tragedy is to let the witches leave your territory."

Roland had previously heard from Wendy about the information on God's Punishment Army and knew that convincing the other party with strength was more effective than any words. Of course, he could ignore Ashes, but by doing so, he would be completely giving up on winning over the witches under Tilly Wimbledon. Although the hope was slim, he still wanted to try.

"How many of the God's Punishment Army can you fight against at the same time?" he asked.

Ashes looked somewhat puzzled, but in the end, she held up three fingers. "I can manage three people."

"Then let's have a contest," Roland sat up straight and said seriously, "Let the result of the competition tell you whether it's possible for me to defeat the God's Punishment Army."

"What did you say...?" Ashes was stunned for a moment, and a different expression finally appeared on her cold face.

"A fair contest, one-on-one," he said word by word, "If I can defeat you head-on, doesn't that prove I have the capability to resist the Church?"

Ashes showed an expression that said 'you're crazy', "You and me? Or do you mean... you want the witches to fight?"

"Of course not me, nor the witches. The God's Punishment Army surely all have Divine Stones of Judgement, right?" Roland smiled, "Your opponent will be an ordinary knight."

Although it was regrettable that he couldn't personally participate, the opponent was after all an extraordinary witch with off-the-charts combat capability, as could be seen from Wendy's description—single-handedly wreaking havoc in the monastery and still managing to escape alive while being pursued by multiple members of the God's Punishment Army. Even with bare hands or a wooden sword, she could exhibit extraordinary lethality. The actual combat effectiveness of the revolving pistol was yet to be examined. For safety's sake, he decided to entrust this glorious task to Carter. If he had an AK47 in his hands, he would have to take it up himself no matter what.

"An ordinary knight..." Ashes's expression returned to its initial indifference. "If I win, will you let the witch go with me?"

"Of course not, just as if you lost, I can't possibly ask Tilly to bring all her witches to Border Town," Roland replied.

"Then what's the point of this duel?"

"It's not a duel, it's a contest," Roland corrected, "The point is to let you know that I am not completely defenseless against the Church. Plus, if you lose, you'll remember when you go back that if you can't stay in the Fjords, the Western Region still has a remote place that can offer a home for witches to live. Of course, if you win, it will at least add to your persuasive power when you try to convince Wendy and the others, won't it?"

"I will not lose," Ashes stated, "Call your knight now."

"Not now," Roland waved his hand, "I need a week to prepare for the contest. During this week, you can stay in the castle, experience life in the town with the witches, and perhaps you might change your previous opinion."

She looked at the prince for a while before nodding, "Maybe they will change their minds and leave Border Town with me before the seven days are up."

Roland shrugged.

As she turned and walked to the door, he suddenly called out to her, "Wait... have I seen you somewhere before?"

Although I am certain I have never seen this face before, the figure from behind gives me a strangely familiar feeling. Roland recalled briefly, and this sense of familiarity seemed to come from... the royal palace.

"Didn't your personal guard tell you?" she didn't turn around, "If it weren't for Tilly stopping me, you probably would have left the palace with only one hand."

After the office door closed, Nightingale appeared and whistled, "Did you touch her butt as well?"

"What?" Roland was stunned, "I don't remember there being such a person in the palace. And what do you mean by 'also' touched?"

Nightingale mouthed a word, and he made out 'Tyra'—damn it, although he did indeed touch the head maid's butt, that was to prevent being caught and done according to convention, alright! I haven't even settled the score with you for spying!

"Cough cough," Anna interrupted the two, "Are you really confident that the knight can defeat the extraordinary witch? If it fails, it might affect the other witches' confidence in you."

Fortunately, Anna's expression still looked calm, Roland breathed a sigh of relief, "A self-strengthening type witch is not affected by the Divine Stone of Judgement, but she still fights with her own physical functions. Compared to rapid-fire thermal weapons that can shoot quickly, the limitations of the body are always too great. I think the odds of winning are at least seventy percent."

However, that is assuming that the research and development of the ammunition can be completed within a week, he thought.
