## The most powerful persuasion
Before meeting the new witch, Roland had already heard a detailed report from Theo.

He had not expected that Tilly Wimbledon, who had been missing for a long time, had become the leader of another witch organization and had even managed to gather most of the witches within the Kingdom of Greycastle before him. What was even more intolerable was that she was now trying to extend her reach into his own territory.

Nightingale said that the witch before him was an Extraordinary, and her abilities were likely combat-oriented.

Since any Extraordinary deserved caution, when Ashes was received in the office, Roland was not only accompanied by the invisible Nightingale but also by Anna. In front of the desk, there were several extremely fine streams of black fire forming an invisible wall to the naked eye, ready to slice her into pieces should she dare to rush forward.

Enhanced witches did not have an advantage in witch conflicts without wearing God's Stones, but once they donned the stones, they possessed unrestricted destructive power. Fortunately, most witches detested the God's Stones, and Ashes probably took this into account. When she came to Border Town to recruit witches, she did not carry any symbolic items of the Church.

"Your witches? Don't be so arrogant. They are living people, not your private property!" Ashes said coldly.

Roland was immediately choked up, experiencing for the first time the awkwardness of being outwitted in a verbal skirmish after his transmigration. Usually, he was used to saying 'my subjects' or 'my citizens', but now he was unexpectedly criticized for his democratic rhetoric, which was exceedingly embarrassing. Although according to the customs of this era, it was not a problem for a lord to refer to the people or things on his land in this way, it was simply not emotionally intelligent to stress this point in front of Nightingale and Anna, and he had fallen into the trap set by the other party.

So he coughed twice and smoothly responded, "I have never thought of it that way. They stay in the town of their own free will, and I believe that this is also their best destination. As for the Fjords you mentioned, not to mention that the journey across the sea is perilous in itself, the Fjords are plagued by unpredictable weather and are frequently battered by storms and tsunamis. It is simply not a suitable place for living."

"But at least there, the Church's power is minuscule. Witches can use their own power to transform their homeland and fight against natural disasters, but they have no way to fight against the Church with God's Stones, let alone the God's Punishment Army," Ashes said mercilessly. "Do you realize how foolish what you've done is? The news that spreads will only lure the Church to your doorstep. Forgive my bluntness, but you have no way to fight against the God's Punishment Army, and the correct way to avoid tragedy is to let the witches leave your territory."



Roland had already heard from Wendy about the intelligence on the God's Punishment Army; he knew that convincing the other party with strength was more effective than any words. Of course, he could ignore Ashes, but by doing so, he would be giving up on trying to win over the witches under Tilly Wimbledon's command. Despite the slim hope, he still wanted to give it a try.



"How many members of the God's Punishment Army can you fight against at the same time?" he asked.



Ashes looked somewhat confused, but in the end, she held up three fingers. "I can handle three."



"Then let's have a contest," Roland sat up straight and said seriously, "Let the result of the contest tell you whether I have a chance to defeat the God's Punishment Army."



"You're saying... what?" Ashes was stunned for a moment, and a different expression finally appeared on her cold face.



"A fair contest, one-on-one," he said word by word. "If I can defeat you head-on, that would prove that I have the ability to resist the Church, right?"



Ashes gave him a look that said 'are you crazy', "You and me? Or are you saying... you want the witches to take part?"



"Of course not me, and certainly not the witches. The God's Punishment Army surely all possess God's Stones of Retribution, right?" Roland smiled, "Your opponent will be an ordinary knight."



Although he felt a bit regretful for not being able to fight in person, the opponent was after all an extraordinary witch with off-the-charts combat ability, which could be seen from Wendy's description—she had single-handedly caused chaos in the monastery and managed to escape alive despite being pursued by several members of the God's Punishment Army. Even if it was with bare hands or a wooden sword, she could still wield extraordinary lethality. The actual combat effectiveness of the revolving pistol remained to be tested. For safety's sake, he decided to hand over this honorable task to Carter. If he had an AK47 in his hands, then he would have to go himself no matter what.



"Ordinary knight..." Ashes' expression returned to its original indifference, "If I win, will you let the witch go with me?"



"Of course not, just like if you lost, I couldn't possibly make Tilly bring all the witches she has gathered to Border Town, right?"



"Then what's the point of this duel?"



"It's not a duel, it's a contest," Roland corrected, "The point is to let you know that I am not completely defenseless against the Church. And if you lose, naturally, you will remember that if you can't stay in the Fjords, there is a remote place in the Western Region that can provide a home for witches to live. Of course, if you win, it would at least add more persuasion when you try to convince Wendy and the others, wouldn't it?"



"I can't possibly lose," Ashes said, "Call your knight now."



"Not now," Roland waved his hand, "It will take me a week to make the necessary preparations for the contest. During this week, you can stay in the castle, experience life in the town with the witches, and perhaps you will retract your previous view."



"..." She looked at the prince for a while before nodding, "Maybe they will change their minds and leave Border Town with me before the seven days are up."



Roland shrugged his shoulders.



Just as she turned and walked to the door, he suddenly called out to her, "Wait... have I seen you somewhere before?"



Although he was certain that he had never seen this face before, there was a strangely familiar feeling about the figure from behind. Roland briefly recalled, and this sense of familiarity seemed to come from... within the royal palace.



"Didn't your personal guard tell you?" she didn't turn around, "If it weren't for Tilly stopping me, you probably would have left the royal palace with only one hand."



After the office door closed, Nightingale appeared and whistled, "Did you also touch her butt?"



"What?" Roland was stunned, "I don't remember there being such a person in the palace at all. And what do you mean by 'also' touched?"



Nightingale shaped her lips to form a word, and he made out "Tyra"—damn it, although he indeed had touched the head maid's butt, it was to avoid revealing any flaws, a customary touch, okay! I haven't even settled the score with you about the peeping!



"Cough cough," Anna interrupted their conversation, "Are you really confident that a knight can defeat an extraordinary witch? If it fails, it might affect the other witches' confidence in you."



Fortunately, Anna's expression still looked calm, and Roland breathed a sigh of relief, "A self-enhancing type witch may not be affected by the God's Punishment Stones, but she still fights using her own bodily functions. Compared to a repeating firearm that can shoot rapidly, the limitations of the body are ultimately too great. I think the odds of winning are at least seventy percent."



However, the premise is that the ammunition research work can be completed within a week, he thought.
