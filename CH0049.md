## Mixed Breed
Roland rubbed his eyes. What on earth was this thing? If the mutation of demonic beasts could still be somewhat understood within the realm of biology, the monster before him now seemed as absurd as something out of a horror movie.



From a distance, it looked like a giant turtle with two heads, but upon closer inspection, those were actually two wolf heads.



Was this some sort of Frankenstein's monster? Roland thought. The massive demonic beast was almost as tall as the city wall, about six meters in length, with six legs resembling those of a rhinoceros—short and thick. But just one of its legs was as big as an adult human's torso. And the heads... those two wolf heads didn't act like the two-headed creatures in movies, which would take turns roaring or fighting each other in a display of dominance. Instead, they hung low, their eyes dull and lifeless, moving forward slowly like walking corpses.



Perhaps the most striking feature was the shell on the demonic beast's back, a dull grey-brown surface covered with algae, which at a glance seemed incredibly hard. It covered the creature from head to tail like a turtle's shell, and if the monster could retract into it like a turtle, it would be quite difficult to kill.



However, Roland wasn't worried. A demonic beast that moved so slowly was nothing but a target. Even if firearms couldn't penetrate the shell, blowing up the exposed wolf heads was always an option. And if it retracted into its shell, they could just use explosives to blast it sky-high.



"Your Highness, this is a hybrid," Iron Axe said, approaching with a tense expression. "I think I understand why there are different kinds of demonic beasts moving together. They must be driven by this hybrid."



Like a lion driving a flock of sheep? Roland nodded. "This one is quite different from the one you encountered last time."



"This is also my first time seeing this type of hybrid. It may look clumsy, but please don't underestimate it. Any hybrid is likely to be difficult to deal with."



"It's about to enter range," Roland said. "Let's start with arrows."



At this moment, light snow was fluttering in the sky, accompanied by the unpredictable northwest wind—it was not the ideal weather for archery. However, the two hunters selected by Iron Axe appeared quite confident.



They climbed up the watchtower, quickly determined the direction of the fleeting wind, and then launched their arrows into the air.



The two sharp arrows seemed as if they had eyes, reaching their peak height before falling almost vertically onto the target's shell under the influence of wind and gravity.



Just as Roland had anticipated, the arrows were directly deflected, and in his mind, he even heard the sound of ricocheting.



The two hunters remained calm and collected, quickly nocking and drawing new arrows, and then fired two more volleys in quick succession.



The final round of simultaneous shooting was effective, with all the arrows landing on the front part of the creature. One of the arrows precisely hit the wolf's head, while another buried itself into the neck of the target.



However, the creature did not roar angrily or accelerate its charge; it merely paused for a moment before retracting its head and legs into its shell, continuing to advance slowly.



This change left everyone dumbfounded.



The demonic beast now resembled a tank with lowered suspension, with the bottom edge of its shell almost scraping the ground as it moved forward. In such a situation, even the best archer would find it impossible to shoot an arrow into its body.



"Load the guns," Roland commanded.



Now that the target was only fifty feet away from the wall, even the smoothbore flintlock rifles didn't need to worry about missing.



Carter and Iron Axe immediately approached the parapet, resting the barrels of their guns on the wall, took aim, and fired.



A puff of white smoke drifted by, and Roland could clearly see the fragments splashing onto the carapace as the bullets struck it, with a small piece of the shell cracking open. The demonic hybrid was unaffected and continued to advance at the same speed.



It seems that the strength of this armor still falls within the category of carbon-based lifeforms, he thought. Unfortunately, the lead bullets were too soft and easily deformed, making them unsuitable for penetrating thick armor. Relying on these four guns to shatter the demonic hybrid's shell was unrealistic; it was time to use the explosive packs.



Iron Axe's judgment was in line with the prince's. He immediately signaled the vice-captain of the spear team to transport the explosives. By then, the demonic beast had already reached the city wall. When it felt that it could no longer advance, its carapace began to vibrate rapidly, like a jackhammer at an extremely high frequency, repeatedly colliding with the wall. Instantly, stone chips flew, and several cracks spread quickly along the cemented joints.



The rubble stone wall had strong compressive strength, but its tensile and shear resistance were extremely poor, which meant that its ability to resist vibration was almost nil. Everyone standing on the wall felt the intense shaking, and soon, a piercing friction sound reached their ears as the demonic hybrid's carapace started to cut a notch into the wall surface.



The impact did not stop. It began to move again, embedding its entire front body into the wall.



The militia fled from the wall section that was full of cracks, while Roland was scooped up around the waist by the invisible Nightingale and jumped directly down from the wall—if someone had been watching the prince at that moment, they would have seen him land with his feet suspended in the air, like a ghost.



As Tanner carefully carried a bag of explosives and hurried over, he was surprised to find that a nearly nine-foot-wide breach had been made in the middle of the city wall. The demonic beasts, having crossed the wall, had stopped shaking and were still moving forward at their previous pace.



"Hurry up!" Iron Axe shouted. "Light it and put it under the feet of this beast!"



Although Tanner's hands were trembling, his mind was unexpectedly clear. Every detail of handling the explosives during training emerged one by one before his eyes. Unlike the prototypes, the final product had a reduced charge and was enclosed in wood, with waste ore fragments filling the space between the explosive bag and the wood. The ignition design was also optimized, using a pull-type ignition with flint and copper wire. If that failed, there was still a normal fuse at the end of the bag for lighting. He clumsily tore the oil-soaked cloth wrapped around the outside, gripped the exposed bend of the copper wire, and pulled it with all his might. A hurried sizzling sound came from the wooden box, followed by smoke rising—this was the sign of successful ignition.



This type of fuse, soaked in saltpeter, burned slowly, taking about ten breaths' time. Tanner saw puffs of white smoke emerging from the box, and the world around him seemed to quiet down. He had seen the power of this thing—if it exploded in his hands, he feared not even a piece of his body would be left.



Nine breaths.



Tanner stood there listening to the pounding of his own heartbeat, silently counting down the time, step by step he approached the demonic beast and placed the explosive bag in its path.



Five breaths.



Then it simply rolled over it, and nothing could stop its advance.



Three breaths.



Tanner turned and ran.



Two breaths.



One breath—



There was only a muffled bang, Tanner felt the ground beneath him shake violently, and the world once again became noisy.



He turned his head and saw a white wave of air burst out from beneath the shell—it was the snow lifted by the explosion of the explosives, which at first glance looked very much like a dispersing mist. The demonic beast finally stopped its advance, as if it could no longer bear the weight it carried, and the massive armor crashed to the ground. Then, black blood gushed out from beneath the shell, soaking the ground around it.



"Ohhh!" 



A cheer suddenly erupted from the crowd.



Tanner sat down on the ground, and only then did he realize his cold sweat had soaked through his clothes.



It was finally over.



As everyone thought this, the high-pitched buzzing of the horn once again resounded across the border. Another wave of demonic beasts emerged from the horizon, rushing toward this remote border town.
