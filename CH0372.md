## Leisure
A week later, Border Town welcomed the last month of autumn amidst a heavy snowfall.

Roland gazed out from the window of his office, watching the black silhouettes flicker against the snowy white rooftops—a daily chore for the townspeople to shovel the accumulating snow to the ground, preventing the roofs from collapsing.



To this day, it had been exactly one year since he arrived in this world, yet the previous autumn had not been nearly as cold, and from this vantage point, one could not see as many neat and dense houses.

Back then, it wouldn't have been surprising to describe the town as an abandoned wasteland. Apart from a circle of decent-looking wooden houses around the square, further out lay nothing but dilapidated mud huts and thatched cottages. The noble's residences were mostly concentrated around the square as well, with the only stone-paved road leading from there to the castle. Beyond that, the town had no other smooth terrain, and human and animal excrement could be found everywhere.



Now, the roads here had all been replaced with macadam surfaces—even without a top layer, they were of excellent quality and sturdy. Dark lines divided the silver-white town into many varied squares, with spacious main roads flanked by the future commercial districts, and residential areas on the periphery.



Besides that, Border Town's industry had gradually taken shape, or rather, had finally transitioned from workshop-style production to a self-sustaining production line—of course, this was limited to the steam engine. The blast furnace area could produce iron ingots that met processing requirements, while the steam factory could turn them into components. The blacksmiths were no longer strangers to the various machines and had even taken on a large number of apprentices. Although the highly precise steam-powered machine tools still relied on Anna to manufacture, this was a considerable advancement for them. After all, before this, these people had only handled blacksmith hammers, or were simply miners or hunters by trade.



For now, it could be regarded as a product of the workers' own strength.



Additionally, the production of bullets and gunpowder was entirely undertaken by ordinary people. Firearms still required Anna's personal touch, not due to a lack of machining tools, but because the town's blast furnace couldn't produce steel of consistent quality—a problem Roland had listed as a priority to solve in the next phase.



The achievements in the field of chemical engineering were much more surprising, probably because there hadn't been many expectations, so any progress was considered an unexpected joy. Now, sulfuric acid and nitric acid had begun mass production, and there were promising developments in chemical explosives. As long as the production of bullets could be increased, transitioning to a new generation of repeating rifles would not be too difficult.



The backward production methods are not a big concern, as for the current situation of the town, solving the issue of availability is more important. Once Paper's abilities stabilize and she can control her magic precisely, the chemical industry might reach a new peak.

The most crucial point is that, whether it is production, education, or construction, Border Town is now on a path of positive development. Given enough time, with more and more educated people, there will be faster breakthroughs in various fields.

Transforming a barren land into what it is today within a year, he felt an overwhelming sense of accomplishment from the bottom of his heart.

Standing by the window and looking over the town, Roland felt he could watch it all day.

At that moment, the melodious sound of a bell came from the northwest.

It was the warning of a demonic beast attack.

Since the Evil Months had begun, the bell would ring roughly every three to four days. However, the First Army had become adept at handling such situations and no longer needed Roland to personally supervise the battle on the walls—thinking back to a year ago, if he hadn't been within sight of the militia, there was no guarantee that they wouldn't have dropped their weapons and fled in panic.

"The demonic beasts are attacking again, should I go take a look?" Nightingale's voice came from beside him.

"Mm," Roland nodded, "be careful."



"Rest assured, they won't be able to touch me."

Then he felt a slight warmth on his cheek, and the voice disappeared.

Roland shook his head helplessly, probably on such a snowy day, the witches were also getting bored, saying it was to observe the situation, but in reality, they were looking for something to do. Especially the combat witches brought by Tilly, who would always be the first to go to the walls to watch the battle when the time came, waiting for those mixed breed demonic beasts that could make it to the top of the walls, so they could show off their skills. Ever since Nightingale found out about this, she also became interested, and would follow them as soon as the alarm sounded, perhaps wanting to see who was the strongest combat witch.

Roland sighed in his heart, she was not this dedicated when it came to studying.

However, fighting side by side to enhance the understanding between witches and ordinary people was not something he was inclined to stop. The current revolving rifles were adequate against the ordinary demonic beasts, but still somewhat inadequate against the wolf-lion hybrids. Having powerful witches on site could effectively stabilize the defense line and reduce the possibility of troop casualties.

So far, the First Army had not yet suffered a single fatality.

Nightingale's departure inspired him; the combat witches had their own diversions, but the support witches didn't have as much fun. Perhaps, it was time to create some new entertainment activities.

With that thought, he called for Scroll.

"Your Highness, do you have a new task for me to complete?"



The artist who made significant contributions to Border Town seemed in high spirits, with the freckles on her face having faded quite a bit, her smile brimming with the irrepressible vibrancy of youth.

Her proactive inquiry made Roland pause slightly, wondering why he suddenly felt a twinge of guilt.

"Uh, have you been busy with work recently?"

"No, why do you ask?" Soraya brushed the hair from her forehead, "There have been fewer people going to the factory lately, so I can finish applying the coatings in half a day. I was only really busy for a while when Alchemist Camilla was making those strange metal boxes," she paused, then turned her head and smiled, "But compared to my days at the Mutual Aid Society's camp, I prefer this fulfilling life. I'm also very happy that my abilities can be of help to you."

Hmm... that smile is quite blinding.

Roland couldn't help feeling a twinge of guilt, "Ahem, I've called you here because I want you to draw some new cards."

"More Gwent decks?"

"No, you've probably grown tired of those," he waved his hand, "After all, the rules are very simple, and there's not much variation if you know what cards your opponent holds."

"True, that is..."



"Look, the new deck is like this, very simple," Roland pulled out a piece of white paper and sketched a rough draft, "It's divided into four suits, and then numbered from one to thirteen, finally adding one King and one Queen, making a total of fifty-four cards."

Soraya's abilities had improved significantly, and she quickly drew a set of coated playing cards directly from the sketch, "How do you play this?"

"There are many ways to play it, but let's start with the simple ones." Roland tested the feel of the cards and immediately was reminded of the feeling before he had crossed over. During the New Year, the most common activity for his family was to sit around a brazier, watch the Spring Festival Gala, and play poker all night long, until daylight when they would set off firecrackers to welcome the arrival of the New Year.

Compared to another traditional entertainment, Mahjong, poker does not require any specific setting, a board on the lap is enough to start, and with its rich variety of games, it can be considered the most popular game in the world.

"Go call Anna," Roland said with a smile, "I'll teach you how to play Landlord."
