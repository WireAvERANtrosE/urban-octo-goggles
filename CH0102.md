## Honeysuckle and the Elk (Part 1)
As night fell, the Elk Count's mansion was brightly lit. Peter, holding an invitation, was welcomed by the attendants into the hall, just as the birthday banquet for the Count's third daughter, Aurelia, was beginning.



Only nobles with considerable heritage and reputation in Longsong Stronghold could attend the banquet. The Count took this celebration very seriously, which was evident from the woolen carpets spread throughout the hall and the attendants’ uniforms, tailored in black with gold trim. After all, Aurelia had just turned sixteen, the age for discussing marriage and betrothal.



The sound of string music began to play as attendants wove through the crowd with glasses and bottles of wine. The round tables in the hall were laden with steaming dishes, and the guest of honor, Aurelia, dressed like a canary, was surrounded by a group of sisters in a corner of the hall, seemingly engaged in lively conversation.



This was the most fashionable banquet style in the capital at the moment. Peter thought to himself that banquets in the Western Region used to be different, where everyone would usually sit around a long wooden table, waiting for the chef to serve the dishes. They would have large bowls of pork, whole chickens, buttered bread, double-sided fried eggs, and large bowls of lettuce leaves.



However, for Peter, who had also spent a few years in the capital, this birthday banquet was only a superficial imitation.



For instance, the attendants held cups of colored glaze instead of the clean, transparent glass cups. After pouring in the wine, the true color and aroma of the wine could not be showcased. The round tables should have been covered with white cloth instead of exposing the greasy tabletops. As for the dishes, they still retained the traditional style of the Western Region—big and crude. Peter shook his head; at the very least, the chefs should have cut the meat into smaller pieces before serving.



As was customary, he had already eaten his fill at home before attending the banquet, and he was not about to carve into these large chunks of cooked meat. The attendees of the banquet represented the face of their respective families, and it would be unseemly to eat with a shiny, greasy mouth in this setting. Peter did not want to become the subject of ridicule among the young ladies.



"Long time no see, buddy," suddenly someone hooked an arm around his neck from behind, "I heard you've been appointed as an envoy by the lord again? How's the ore yield in Border Town, you must have skimmed quite a bit, huh?"



Recognizing the familiar voice, Peter knew it was Rene Mead, the second son of the Elk family, a fool who aspired to be a famous knight and neglected his own territory. Of course, he was also a friend. "Not bad," Peter didn't really want to talk about his experiences in Border Town, "Did you make yourself useful on your trip to the Coldwind Ridge, or were you just shivering in the taverns in Hermes all the time?"



"Damn it," Rene pushed Peter a bit, "I've never heard anything nice come out of your mouth. This time I didn't even go to the New Holy City. The day before the Border Guards set out, I just happened to catch a cold and was in bed for a whole week."

"Not bad, you've improved a bit since last time, at least you saved the guards a lot of trouble."

"You're wrong this time," Rene suddenly said with a mysterious smile, "If I hadn't been lying in Coldwind Ridge for a week, I might have been lying forever on the cold walls of the Holy City."

"What do you mean?" Peter raised an eyebrow.

"I heard it from others," the Second Son of the Elk leaned in close and whispered, "The New Holy City was almost lost, the demonic beasts had rushed into the inner city. If it wasn't for the Church dispatching their strongest warriors, I'm afraid even the Grand Cathedral would not have been spared. But the armies of the Four Kingdoms all suffered heavy losses, hardly anyone came back from Coldwind Ridge. In just one month, the city was full of widows, and those without savings at home..." he winked and gestured with two fingers, "just two Silver Royals. Hey, don't look at me like that, I didn't do anything."

"Are you sure this news is true? What about the Border Guards?"

"Of course, I saw it with my own eyes, the lord fell ill the day he received the message," shrugged Rene, "As for the guards... what else can they do but slowly recruit again. The North is now in urgent need of experienced soldiers. If my family hadn't insisted on calling me back, I could at least have been leading a cavalry unit by now."

That's not the point, Peter thought to himself. The main defense target of the Coldwind Ridge Border Guards is the Church's Judgement Army. Now, with the leaders and soldiers of the Four Kingdoms laid to rest in Hermes, it all seems a bit conspiratorial. If they are up to something, the north of Graycastle now is like a stripped woman, "What about the Judgement Army, how were their losses?"

"They won't be much better than the armies of the Four Kingdoms. Just think about it, they're always the most fanatical ones charging at the front. That being said, if the Judgement Army didn't step up, the troops from the other countries certainly wouldn't have budged," he said disdainfully, "That's how those knights are, always talking about honor, but when it comes to fighting the demonic beasts, they prefer to shrink back."



"For example, this gentleman before me," Peter chuckled, perhaps overthinking it. But even if the Church wanted to make a move against the North, it had nothing to do with Longsong Stronghold. Let the new king worry about that.



"Regrettably, no one has yet accepted my allegiance, or rather, I haven't found anyone worthy of it," Rene paused, glancing towards the door, "The people from the Wolfheart family have arrived. I'll go and greet them first, then come back to find you."



"Go ahead, no need to come back."



"Oh, right," he turned back after taking a few steps, "Did you notice the handkerchief in the invitation?"



"Was that your doing?"



"Ha, I'd only stuff a pair of two-day-old socks in your pocket," he wagged his finger, "That was cut by my sister herself. Although there's quite an age gap between you two, as long as you're interested, I'll wholeheartedly support you both. Don't drag your feet, my friend, you're already twenty-two."



Peter rolled his eyes at him, and the latter whistled and walked away, laughing.



Taking a glass of wine from a waiter's tray, Peter strolled to a corner alone and quietly observed the lively hall. He noticed that while Aurelia and her sisters were chatting merrily, they would also sneak peeks in his direction. During that brief moment when their eyes met, he could see her quickly avert her gaze and a hint of blush spread across her cheeks.



Peter returned the gesture with a polite smile. However, in his view, she was still just a young girl.



Suddenly, a fierce discussion erupted on one side of the hall, drawing everyone's attention.

"What! He really dares to say that?"

"Yes, that coward Kori, didn't even dare to let out a peep and just slunk back like that," said the loudest person, "It's simply a disgrace to Longsong Stronghold!"

Peter recognized him; he seemed to be called Simon Elay, a branch of the Wolfheart family, who had married a quite attractive woman. He had seen that woman too, and indeed, she was uniquely charming.

"It sounds as if you have a way to deal with it," someone sneered.

"I might not be able to do it alone, but if we can get the attention of His Grace, the Duke, I don't believe Roland Wimbledon would dare to continue acting so recklessly!"

Hearing this familiar name, Peter froze for a moment, his interest immediately piqued.
