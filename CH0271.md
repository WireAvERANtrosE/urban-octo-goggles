## Elements
Kyle Sichi finished today's experiment and returned home, his wife had already prepared baked flatbread and mushroom soup, and also poured him a full glass of white liquor.

The latter two were goods sold at the Convenience Market, especially these large, pure white mushrooms, just like the description on the signboard: "You will never find a delicacy more fresh and delicious than this," and after trying them, he found this to be true. Just one bite and it's hard to forget such a rich and unique flavor.

Of course, its price was also astonishingly high, with a palm-sized mushroom costing one Silver Royal. If it wasn't for his generous salary, Kyle wouldn't have been able to afford such expensive food. There were many such items, like soap, mirrors—with money, life in the town was much more comfortable than that of an average noble.

Roland was truly unfathomable, and that was what Kyle felt most deeply.

After enjoying dinner, his wife handed him a letter.

"What is this?"

"The guards brought it this afternoon when you were not home," his wife said while clearing the tableware. "They said it seems to come from Redwater City."

"Is that so?" Kyle walked into his study, used a small knife to cut open the seal, and spread out the letter.

The opening sentence was unexpectedly, "Hello, esteemed Mentor."



This was a letter from Chemi sent to him, and he couldn't help but smile as he sat at his desk and began to read it carefully.



After he had left the alchemy workshop in Redwater City, another alchemist named Cabala had become the new chief. However, this person was narrow-minded, and after obtaining the crystal glass formula left by Kyle, he not only claimed to the lord that it was a joint work between him and Kyle, but also intentionally or unintentionally excluded Chemi in the alchemical experiments.



In the letter, Chemi complained that perhaps it was because he had borrowed Cabala’s apprentice when he was exploring the double stone acid-making method, and yet he had not informed the other party of the results beforehand. Now, it seemed that the other alchemists were also starting to avoid him intentionally or unintentionally, which was very troubling for Chemi.



Kyle could probably understand the thoughts of these people—Chemi, as the youngest alchemist in the refining room, was considered by many to have distinguished himself from the many disciples only by luck and Kyle’s favor. But the chief alchemist sneered at this view. Since saltpeter and green vitriol were common substances, why was it Chemi who discovered the double stone acid-making method and not someone else? This alone was enough to prove the point. Observational skills, memory, bold conjectures, and careful experimentation were all indispensable, and this young man's talent was even greater than his own.



At the end of the letter, Chemi also attached two alchemical formulas, saying they were new discoveries from his recent research on acids, which he wanted to share with his mentor. Kyle recognized at a glance that the essence of the two formulas was nothing more than the neutralization reaction of acid and base to form salts, something he could write a dozen of in one go.



With a sigh, Kyle Steuer put down the letter and turned his gaze back to the book "Elementary Chemistry" on the desk, which had been flipped through several times.



What changed everything was this "ancient book" that His Highness had given him. If it weren't for it, he might still be like Chemi, still sifting through the superficial soil in chaos and confusion, treating it as a treasure.



He picked up the book and flipped directly to the last page.



There was a neatly divided table with about a hundred squares.



Every time he saw this table, he couldn't help but get goosebumps and feel an inexplicable reverence... and fear.



Each cell in the grid was marked with a tiny serial number, totaling one hundred and eighteen by the end. Except for the first two rows, most cells were blank, but some were filled with symbols. For instance, number twenty-six: Iron, number twenty-nine: Copper.



The table was named "The Elemental Periodic Table."



The Chief Alchemist once held the book tremblingly and asked Roland about the content of the blank spaces, only to be told, "It was originally filled out, but he simply couldn't remember anymore."



If the other party wasn't His Royal Highness, what he wanted to do most was to slap the entire book onto the other party's face.



According to the book, this table encompassed all the elements in the world—if there was a holy scripture for alchemy, without a doubt, it would be the most dazzling chapter within. What filled him with fear was the question: what kind of person could have drawn up such a chart? If they had reached this stage, what was alchemy then? It was nothing more than a castle crookedly built by children in the sand.



Kyle suddenly remembered His Highness's promise that if he could bring over Chemist and pull together a group of apprentices who hadn't been able to leave last time, there might be hope to fill the three new laboratories. Then, he could obtain the coveted "Intermediate Chemistry."



With that thought, he immediately pulled out a piece of blank paper and began writing a reply.



In fact, when His Royal Highness had asked him during the meeting if he had any clue about large-scale acid production, he hadn't told the whole truth, because those details were complex and lengthy to explain and would be a waste of time. Most importantly, he didn't know if his plan would work, as the methods he envisioned for production were entirely based on the elements and reaction principles from the books.



Compared to the previous alchemical experiments, this hypothesis even seemed like the delirious babble of a child dreaming—using substances never seen before and unheard-of methods of reaction to produce something that appeared completely irrelevant to the raw materials, simply because they shared the same element.

But Kyle Sichi had a faint premonition that this method might just work!

After all, the hundreds of transmutation experiments before had without exception proven the correctness of the content described in the book.

With a preliminary plan in place, the next step was to complete a full set of theoretical experiments in the laboratory because His Highness had said that a product that could be mass-produced using industrial methods could also be replicated in the laboratory.

The letter was quickly written. He did not offer Charles excessive consolation, but instead directly told his once greatest disciple about the known, the measurable, and the attainable aspects of alchemy. Kyle believed that any wise person with a keen interest in alchemy would not miss such an opportunity to witness the truth.

He folded the letter neatly into the envelope, sealed it with wax, and then all that was left was to wait until tomorrow to hand it over to a merchant willing to deliver it.

Having done all this, his gaze returned to the periodic table.

If the blanks on the table were never filled, Kyle would find life utterly joyless. Fortunately, Prince Roland's last words stirred his emotions, those words still lingered in his ears—

"Don't look so downcast. Every element on the periodic table is arranged according to rules, and you can completely rely on yourself to fill it in."



"Rules... arrangement? Do you mean to say that unknown elements can also be deduced, just like alchemical formulas?"

"That's right, even if you have never seen them, you can describe their appearance and properties."

"Then... what is this rule?"

"You want to know? It's all in 'Intermediate Chemistry'."
