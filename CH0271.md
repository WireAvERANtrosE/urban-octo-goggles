## Elements
After finishing today's experiment, Kamo Squirrel returned home to find that his wife had made baked flatbread and mushroom soup, and she had poured him a glass of white wine.

Both of these were goods sold at the convenience market, especially the large white mushrooms which lived up to their description on the sign: "You won't find a more delicious and fresh flavor than this," and after trying them, he found this to be true. Just one bite and it was hard to forget their rich and unique taste.

Of course, the price was also astonishing; a palm-sized mushroom cost one Silver royal. If it weren't for his generous salary, Kamo would never dare to buy such expensive food. There were many such items, like soap and mirrors; with money, life in the small town was much more comfortable than that of the average noble.

Roland was truly unfathomable, and this was the most profound feeling he had.

After enjoying dinner, his wife handed him a letter.

"What's this?"

"The guard brought it this afternoon when you were not yet home," his wife said while cleaning up the tableware. "He mentioned it seemed to come from Redwater City."

"Is that so?" Kamo walked into his study, cut open the envelope with a knife, and spread out the letter.

The opening line was actually, "Hello, esteemed mentor."



This is a letter from Chem, he couldn't help but smile as he sat down at his desk to read it carefully.



It turns out that after he left the alchemy workshop in Redwater City, another alchemist named Kabala became the new chief. However, this man was narrow-minded. After obtaining the crystal glass formula left by Kyle, he not only claimed to the lord that this was the work of both him and Kyle, but also intentionally or unintentionally pushed Chem out during alchemical experiments.



In his letter, Chem complained that perhaps it was because he had borrowed Kabala's apprentice while exploring the double-stone acidification method, and in the end, he hadn't informed the other party of the results in advance. Now, it seemed like the other alchemists were also starting to avoid him, which made Chem very troubled.



Kyle could probably understand these people's thoughts. As the youngest alchemist in the purification room, many people thought that he stood out from the many disciples only by luck and Kyle's favor. But the chief alchemist scoffed at this idea. Saltpeter and green vitriol were common things; why was it Chem who discovered the double-stone acidification method and not someone else? This was already enough to explain the problem. Observation skills, memory, bold conjectures, and careful experimentation were all indispensable, and this young man's talent was even above his own.



At the end of the letter, Chem had also included two alchemical formulas, saying they were new discoveries from his recent research on acids, which he shared with his mentor. Kyle immediately saw that the essence of the two formulas was nothing more than the neutralization reaction of acid and alkali generating salt. He could easily write out a dozen such formulas in one breath.



Sighing, Kyle Sichi put down the letter and his gaze moved back to the "Elementary Chemistry" book that had been flipped through several times.



It was this "ancient book" given to him by His Highness that changed everything. If it weren't for this book, he might still be like Chem, still fumbling in chaos and confusion, sifting through the superficial soil and treating it as treasure.



He picked up the book and flipped directly to the last page.



There it was, a neatly divided table with about a hundred squares.



Every time he saw this chart, he couldn't help but get goosebumps, feeling an indescribable reverence... and fear.



Each cell on the top left corner of the grid was marked with a small serial number, totaling one hundred and eighteen. Aside from the first two rows, most of the cells were blank, but some were filled with symbols. For example, number twenty-six: Iron, number twenty-nine: Copper.



The chart was named "The Periodic Table of Elements."



The Chief Alchemist once trembled while holding the book, asking Roland about the content of the blank spaces, only to receive the reply that "it was originally filled, but he really couldn't remember."



If the other party hadn't been His Highness, what he most wanted to do was to smack the entire book onto the other party's face.



According to the records in the book, this chart encompassed all elements in the world—if there ever was a holy scripture for alchemy, without a doubt, this would be the most dazzling chapter within. What frightened him was, what kind of person could have drawn such a chart? If they had reached this point, what was alchemy? Nothing but a castle of sand crookedly piled up by a group of children.



Kyle suddenly remembered the prince's promise. If he could bring over Chemist and pull together a group of apprentices who didn't make it last time, perhaps he could hope to fill the three new laboratories. In doing so, he might get his hands on the much-coveted "Intermediate Chemistry."



With that thought, he immediately pulled out a sheet of white paper and began to write a reply.



In fact, when His Highness asked him during the meeting whether he had any leads on mass-producing acid, he didn't tell the whole truth, because the content was complex and lengthy, and it was a waste of time to explain. Most importantly, he didn't know if his plan would work, as the method he envisioned for obtaining the acid was entirely based on the elements and reaction principles described in the book.



Compared to the previous alchemical experiments, this hypothesis even seemed like the babbling of a child in a dream—using substances never seen before and unheard-of methods of reaction, to create something that looks entirely unrelated to the raw materials, simply because they share the same element.

However, Kyle Sichi had a vague premonition that this method just might work!

After all, the hundreds of substitution experiments that had been conducted before all attested to the correctness of the contents described in the book.

With a preliminary plan in place, the next step was to complete a full set of theoretical experiments in the laboratory, because His Highness had said that a product that could be mass-produced using industrial methods could also be replicated in the laboratory.

The letter was soon finished. He didn't offer much in the way of consolation to Charles, but rather spoke directly to his once-great disciple about the knowable, measurable, and attainable aspects of alchemy. Kyle believed that any sage who was passionate about alchemy wouldn't miss such an opportunity to witness the truth.

After folding the letter and placing it in an envelope, and sealing it with wax, all that was left was to wait until tomorrow to hand it over to a willing merchant to deliver.

Having done all this, his gaze returned to the periodic table.

If the blanks on the table were never to be filled, Kyle would feel that life henceforth would be devoid of joy. Thankfully, the latter words of Prince Roland had stirred his emotions, those words still lingered in his ears—

"Don't look so glum, every element on the periodic table is arranged according to a pattern, and you can certainly fill it in on your own."



"Regular... arrangement? Do you mean to say that unknown elements can be inferred, just like deducing alchemical formulas?"

"That's right, even if you've never seen them, you can describe their appearance and properties."

"Then... what is this regularity?"

"You want to know? It's all in 'Intermediate Chemistry'."
