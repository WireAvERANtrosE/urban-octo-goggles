## Rescue
Anna nodded, stretched the black fire into a thread, and gently pressed it against the crystal pillar.

The witches couldn't help but hold their breath as they saw plumes of green smoke rise from the point of contact—not the actual color of the smoke, but a varying hue under the reflection of the green fire.

The black fire embedded itself into the crystal.

"How's it going?" Tilly asked.

"It's a bit strenuous, but it can be cut," Anna replied.

All of a sudden, the "Ice Coffin" underwent a change. Accompanied by a crisp crackling sound, several fractures spread from where the black fire had embedded itself, sprawling across the entire pillar like a spider web in the blink of an eye. Almost at the same time, Sylvie raised a barrier, enveloping the witches within.

But the expected explosion did not occur; the shattered crystal collapsed in chunks like crumbling earth, revealing a core that emitted a chill—an inner layer made of true ice crystal. In an instant, everyone felt the biting cold as the surrounding temperature plummeted.

Fortunately, Anna quickly stabilized the falling temperature and brought it back to normal.

Under the baking of the black fire, the ice crystal melted even faster, its transparency sharply decreased, and its shape no longer had sharp edges, shrinking and melting like a regular block of ice. However, Tilly noticed that there was no pool of water forming on the ground; the melted parts all turned into smoke and drifted away as if the "Ice Coffin" had never existed.



When all the ice crystals melted away, the woman sealed within revealed her true form.

She seemed to still be trapped in slumber, her long hair and robe showing no signs of having been wet, everything was as it was when she was encased in ice. Losing the support of the ice pillar, her body went limp and fell backward, then Ashes caught her in her arms.

"Is she still alive?"

"Her heartbeat is very faint, but it hasn't stopped," Ashes pressed her hand against the other's chest, "This... is simply unbelievable."

Indeed, it was unbelievable. Tilly realized that since coming to Border Town, in less than a week, she had encountered more unimaginable things than in the previous year. But she also felt slightly relieved. To be able to survive in the extremely low temperatures of the ice crystals, her identity was almost certain—she was a witch.

This adventurous act had, after all, not been in vain.

As for her name, her origin, and why she was trapped in the ruins, these questions could wait until they returned to be slowly inquired.

...

Andrea was somewhat boredly guarding next to the hollow, occasionally glancing down into the pit, hoping to be the first to see Tilly return.



No devils appeared around the relic, and even demonic beasts were rarely seen. Occasionally, wolves or wild boars would pop out from the woods, but before there was even a need to draw a bow, Nightingale had already nailed her dagger into their heads. 



As time seemed to slow down, aside from herself, only the witches from the Witch Cooperation Association remained on guard near the cave entrance. She couldn't even find someone to chat with to pass the time. Although the woman named Wendy looked very amiable, Andrea just couldn't muster the courage to initiate a conversation. 



As a noble from the upper echelons of Dawn, elegance and reserve were qualities that an unmarried lady must possess.



Never mind, better to chat with Nightingale. It was said that she had fought toe-to-toe with Ashes and neither had won. Since it was about gathering information on an old opponent, it wouldn't count as striking up a conversation.



Yes, this was just a necessary task.



She brushed the snow off her head and looked up, only for her heart to suddenly leap—Nightingale was gone. 



The woman with golden curls, who looked just as elegant as a noble, had been leaning against the basket, but now she had disappeared. Right, her ability seemed to be concealing her form.



With this in mind, Andrea calmed down and listened for any sounds around her, using her ears and nose as good allies to capture the movements of her opponents when sight was of no use.



Then she heard the faint rustling of footsteps.



Is it Nightingale?

No, Andrea felt her hair stand on end; these footsteps were clearly not made by one person—there was a group of people approaching from the jungle ahead, only a hundred steps away from her! But as she looked around, everything seemed calm, and not a single figure could be seen.

The footsteps quickly closed in, damn it, the enemy is invisible!

Just as she was about to sound the alarm, a roar suddenly burst beside her ear.

Flames flashed in mid-air, followed by a shaking of the air, and a strangely shaped monster appeared—it had a narrow head and sharp scythes for arms, resembling a mutated mantis. However, unlike any insect, it walked upright.

The bullet from the flintlock shattered its face, and black blood sprayed from its head, almost splashing onto Andrea.

The monster fell with a thud, and then she saw Nightingale's fluttering white cape and hood.

Then came the second gunshot!

Damn, she had been careless! Andrea bit her lip; she had noticed all this sooner than herself.



She summoned her magic longbow but did not know where to shoot, so she slowly retreated to the side of the hanging basket to stand with the other witches.

Four gunshots rang out, and four monsters fell, all killed with a single shot.

When Nightingale reappeared beside one of the monsters, Andrea put away her weapon and quickly walked over.

"What is this?"

"It's either a demonic beast or a devil," she crouched down to fiddle with the enemy's claws and sickles, "but judging by the color of their blood, they're more like demonic beasts."

"When did you notice them?"

"From the moment they appeared," Nightingale smiled, "in the Mist, the magical glow from their bodies is as conspicuous as the stars in the night sky."

"Demonic beasts can also have such abilities?" Andrea frowned.

The other's smile stiffened, "Uh... the mixed breeds are probably a bit special."



At this moment, the witches who had gone deep into the cave also returned to the surface. In addition to the original seven, Ashes had an additional blue-haired woman on her shoulder.

"Is she the one who was calling for help in the ruins?" Andrea stepped forward to ask.

"Yes," Tilly nodded, "We'll talk about the details aboard the Seawatch. The longer we stay in this forest, the more uneasy I feel. By the way, did you encounter any danger up there?"

"A few strange hybrid demonic beasts came, but they're all dead now," Nightingale shrugged.

The hot air balloon quickly inflated and rose into the air, the basket passing over the tops of the trees and began moving toward the town. At that moment, Sylvie let out a cry of surprise, "My God, what is all that below? Demonic beasts?"

"Demonic beasts?" Andrea leaned out to look in the direction of the ruins, but saw nothing.

No, there was indeed something moving on the ground. The previously fallen monster corpses suddenly lost half of their mass, and the black bloodstains were smeared; at the boundaries between soil and snow, one could see bizarre twisting motions, like observing objects through a glass. If one did not look closely, it would be difficult to notice these changes.

"It's those strange hybrids again," Nightingale said nonchalantly, "There must be around a hundred of them, all scurrying into the cave... Perhaps they are attracted by that giant creature and want to have a feast?" She yawned, "But all of this has nothing to do with us anymore."
