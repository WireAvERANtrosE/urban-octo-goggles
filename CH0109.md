## Echo (Part 2)
However, the Ashes clan was defeated in a duel by the treacherous Iron Whip clan, which not only led to the killing of the clan chief but also to the exile of the clan to the endless cape. As the daughter of the clan chief, Zol Silvermoon, also known as Echo, was sold to a slave trader in Clearwater Harbor because of her outstanding appearance.



Iron Axe, due to his mixed blood, was adopted by the Ashes clan but was not considered a real Mojin by the Sand People, hence he was not sentenced to exile. Instead, because of his high martial skills, he was sought after by other clans who wanted to recruit him. Iron Axe, grateful for the clan chief's care over the years and determined to rescue Echo, did not hesitate to refuse the other clans. After a series of arduous journeys, he finally arrived at Clearwater Harbor, only to find that by then Echo had been sold to the capital of Greycastle.



Later on, one was saved by a witch and became a member of the Witch Union; the other, disheartened, headed toward the western regions of Greycastle. Until today, the two unexpectedly reunited in Border Town.



"What do you plan to do then," Roland pondered for a moment, "return to the Southernmost Region with Echo and revive the Ashes clan?"



"No, Your Highness!" Iron Axe knelt on one knee, "I have sworn to the Three Gods that I will serve you for the rest of my life. It's just that... at that moment, upon seeing Lady Silvermoon, I was too excited and couldn't control my emotions. Please punish me!"



"And what about you?" The prince looked at Echo, "Do you want to avenge your clansmen?"



Echo also knelt down, "I thought of revenge when I first awakened as a witch, but now I have long since abandoned such thoughts." She bit her lip, "Please allow me to stay here... I have nowhere else to go."



"I understand, stand up," Roland said calmly, "There's no need for this, I haven't even said anything yet." He paused briefly, then changed tack, "Actually, helping you take revenge is not impossible."



"What?" Iron Axe's eyes widened, as if he couldn't believe his ears. Echo, on the other hand, didn't react much, indicating that she truly had no hope of returning to Iron Sand City.



"Of course not now," Roland waved his hand. This was not a whim of his; in Iron Axe's description of the extreme southern region, he heard some very interesting things—the land was scorching hot and dry, with a bizarre environment. Especially the orange fire that erupted from the ground, which could burn for decades without extinguishing. Near the orange fire, one could often see huge ground faults. At the bottom of the faults, the black River of the Nether flowed incessantly.



Be it the orange fire or the River of the Nether, to Roland, it all sounded like oil. Moreover, it seemed like oil that flowed openly! The importance of this black liquid for industry was self-evident; modern wars were half caused by it, and fluctuations in oil prices could affect the rise and fall of a group of countries, and even change the world's pattern. If he could get involved in the extreme southern region under the pretext of the affairs of the Sand Nation, perhaps he could secure a stable source of oil.



However, Roland had no time to attend to the disputes in remote areas and could only leave a lead for later to play out a "since ancient times" drama.



"Once I ascend to the throne, I will consider seeking justice for you," Roland stopped Iron Axe, who was about to kneel again, "But today you have violated the first military discipline, so you are to be confined for two days. Reflect on your actions."



"Yes, Your Highness," Iron Axe replied excitedly.



"Then training continues," Roland said to the Chief Knight, "You will be in charge of the next marching drill."



Carter nodded in agreement.

...

Brian originally thought today's training would end there, but everyone remained seated in the training field, and not a single person left on their own.



Since Carter left with the prince, the order he gave was to rest on the spot, not to disband.

If it was the patrol team he had been with before, such a scenario was simply unimaginable.

"Sir Knight, do you think Sir Iron Axe will come back?" Nail, from the same group, leaned in to ask, "His actions earlier really gave me quite a scare."

"How many times have I told you not to call me 'sir'?" Brian corrected, "In the First Army, you should call me team leader. His Highness said we should address each other by our military ranks." After being knighted by the Fourth Prince, his status in the team had risen sharply, and the others didn't dare to talk to him much, only Nail—a short fellow who had transferred from the mines to the military—often came up to chat with him. According to Nail, he had even talked to Prince Roland himself up close and personal.

"As for that matter... His Highness probably won't blame him too much, right?" Although he said this, Brian himself was not certain. He had seen a commoner accidentally bump into the former lord's carriage and get stabbed to death on the spot by the guards. Iron Axe was a foreigner, and kneeling before a woman in front of the prince, calling her "chieftain," was definitely a breach of etiquette.

"I guess so," Nail nodded repeatedly, "I've spoken to Prince Roland myself, and he's, um..." He scratched his head, seemingly searching for the right words, "He looks similar to those nobles, but feels completely different."

Brian also did not want anything bad to happen to Iron Axe; after more than a month of collective training, he had grown to greatly admire this foreigner. Especially during the outdoor exercises when Iron Axe taught everyone how to set up tents—his exquisite skills and patient instruction benefited everyone. In the knight's eyes, Iron Axe was even more suitable than Carter Lannis to command the First Army.



"Here they come!" Nail nudged Brian's arm, "Eh, it seems that Sir Iron Axe is not with them."

Before he could let his thoughts wander, Carter had already ordered everyone to get in formation, standing neatly in the groups they had been assigned to before. Then Prince Roland stepped forward to speak, "The woman beside me is a witch named Echo, who is also a long-lost... relative of Iron Axe. Iron Axe has been punished with two days of confinement for disrupting the formation and violating military discipline. I want to reiterate that you are a regular army, and the most important thing for a soldier is to obey orders and uphold discipline! Do you understand?"



"Yes, Your Highness!" Brian said aloud with the others. Hearing Iron Axe's decision, he felt a sense of relief. Nail beside him even stealthily made a funny face at him.



"The training to come will be assisted by Echo. Her ability is to mimic all sorts of sounds, including musical instruments, horns, and drums. The marching tune she will play next is the command that directs your movements! Everyone must march to the beat of the drum, trying to keep the formation in a straight line," said the princess, pausing for a moment, "On the battlefield, Echo will stand behind you. She is the flag of the First Army, the soul of the Gun Battalion! You must protect her at all costs! Now... everyone get familiar with the tune."



What was a marching tune? Brian looked puzzled. Was it one of those songs occasionally played in taverns? Would such a soft, tender melody be suitable to command everyone to advance?



However, as an unfamiliar melody began to come from Echo's mouth, he almost instantly understood the princess's intention—the rhythmic drumbeats made him want to start marching, and the lively tune stirred up his desire for battle.



—The so-called marching tune was a 'battle song' that inspired people on the battlefield, motivating everyone to keep moving forward.
