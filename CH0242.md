## New Architectural Field
The first award ceremony lasted until noon. As the person responsible for conferring the awards, providing commentary, and hosting, Roland was utterly exhausted by the end. Thankfully, the ceremony finally concluded with the ringing of the noon bell and the sound of celebratory cannon fire. Sweating profusely, he returned to the castle and just as he stepped onto the third floor, he saw Anna leaning against the office door with a smile on her face.

"What's going on?"

"You'll see when you go in." She winked her beautiful lake-blue eyes at him.

It couldn't be some kind of prank, could it? Roland, puzzled, pushed the door open and was immediately stunned—lined up in two neat rows were twelve witches, with Scroll and Wendy at the front. Upon seeing the prince, everyone simultaneously lifted their skirts slightly, bent their knees, and bowed.

"Cough cough, what is this…"

Scroll was the first to speak, "Your Highness, your actions have proven everything you've said, and we sisters are deeply grateful. No words can describe our gratitude, and we ask to continue to serve you in the future."

"I see," Roland breathed a sigh of relief, "I thought you were all going to resign en masse."

"Pfft," Wendy couldn't help but laugh, "How could that be possible, Your Highness? This is the holy mountain that witches have dreamed of. As long as you don't drive us away, we hope to live here forever."

"And that is exactly what I want to see... In fact, you don't have to do this; I'm not just helping you, I'm also helping myself. Don't be too serious; I prefer to see you relaxed and at ease."



"Hmph, I said there was no need to be so formal," Lily snorted. "See, he even thinks we're too serious."

"Not at all, you agreed right away too," Miya muttered quietly, "Traitor!"

"Alright, everyone head to the dining room first, His Highness still needs to change," Scroll helplessly held her forehead, "By the way, Miss Anna mentioned you've been sleeping late recently? Please take care of your health, you can't fall before that goal is achieved."

"Don't worry," Roland smiled, "I'm in very good health."

After the witches filed out, only he and Anna were left in the office.

"So, you're also here to express your gratitude?" Roland teased her.

"Um... what I want to say is the same as them," Anna lifted the corners of her mouth, "'No words can describe my gratitude.'"

"And then... you hope to continue living in Border Town?"

"That's not necessarily the case."



Roland was momentarily stunned, his heart skipping a beat. "Why?"



"Because you won't stay here forever," Anna said, tilting her head, "…and no matter where you go, I will always follow you."



A warm current suddenly surged in his heart. Since the day he met her, her thoughts had never changed. Whether facing the invitation of the Mutual Aid Society or the dire moments against the demonic beasts, she had chosen to stand with him.



Just then, Anna suddenly stepped forward and gently embraced him.



"Wait, I'm sweaty," Roland reminded her.



The girl didn't reply, but instead pressed her head against his chest, as if she wanted to memorize his scent, taking a deep breath. He eventually gave up on the idea of pushing her away and wrapped his arms around her fair neck, holding on for a long time without letting go.

...

After lunch, Roland took a cold shower and quickly immersed himself in work.



He called Karl Barton over, spread out the detailed map of Border Town, and pointed to the location of the Redwater River. "I want to build a bridge here."



"Not a pontoon bridge?" Karl pondered for a moment before speaking, "Please forgive my frankness, Your Highness, but here at Redwater River, nearly a hundred meters wide, it is almost impossible to build a stone bridge. Even an arch bridge could at most span a third of the distance. With the great flow of the Redwater River, it's impossible to set the bridge piers down; even stone piles as thick as a man would be washed away... Apart from raft crossing and pontoon bridges, there isn't a single bridge across the entire river."



"It's not a stone bridge, but a steel bridge," Roland explained, "with three spans. The central piers will be dealt with by witches. You only need to get the approach parts of the bridge set up in advance. However, I require an incline at the bridge head to raise the entire structure so that inland sailboats can pass underneath without their masts touching the bottom of the bridge."



"Isn't that like building the bridge up to the sky?" Karl exclaimed in surprise.



"It's only about six or seven meters above the ground," he casually drew a schematic diagram of the three-span iron bridge on the sketch, "For better development of the south bank in the future, as well as for dockyard construction, a bridge that doesn't hinder navigation is necessary. Although a pontoon bridge is simple, it essentially blocks the river, which is unfavorable for subsequent development."



The First Army's expedition to the capital had given Roland quite a few insights—he discovered that the rivers within the boundaries of Greycastle flowed in all directions, with major cities built beside several main waterways. If he were to conduct warfare within his territory in the future, having several shallow-water heavy gunboats would definitely be an asset for providing fire support and conquering lands—after all, the power of naval guns, known for their caliber, was far beyond that of field artillery. And to build ships, first, he needed a dockyard, hence the plan for the steel bridge was conceived.



"But I have no experience in building such bridges..." Karl hesitated.



"Neither do I," Roland shrugged, "We'll just have to explore this together step by step. You can set up the bridge on the shore and test it first. Once that's done, we can move it to the Redwater River," he also imparted to him the concept of overall prefabrication and one-time hoisting construction, "Just like installing a water tower, with the help of the Hummingbird to lighten its weight, and your student Anna to assist with assembly and welding, it won't be too difficult."



"By your... command, Your Highness," he nodded.



"Besides that, there's another very important project I want to entrust to you," the prince moved his finger to the area of the castle, "I plan to expand the scale of the backyard, enclosing all the open space on the high ground into it, and build a three-story building here."



If all goes well, next month Tilly's five witches will arrive in Border Town, and there are no spare guest rooms left in the castle. Although it's possible to temporarily change to three people per room, the number of witches is always increasing, and it won't be possible to keep making do. Superior living conditions and a variety of novel and comfortable experiences are also part of my strategy to retain the witches. Whether it is the difficulty of transitioning from luxury to austerity of the ancients or the modern theory of sugar-coated bullets, a beautiful and comfortable life can always be addictive.



"A three-story... brick house?"



"Not exactly a brick house," Roland smiled. "Its name should be reinforced concrete structure. The columns and top beams are all made of reinforced concrete, like the bones of a human. This structure allows the house to be built taller, and it won't be a problem to add to four or five stories later."



"Reinforced... concrete?" Karl repeated, looking puzzled.



"It is a mixture of cement, sand, and gravel, with steel bars embedded in it to enhance its bending resistance," he explained. "Of course, the exact amount of each ingredient needs to be rigorously tested. If configured successfully, it can even be more durable than natural bluestone."



In theory, there is a lot of flexibility in the quality of this material. The same concrete, if mixed by farmers using their own cement, is entirely different from that mixed at batching stations. The same goes for steel bars... Some people even build their own homes on their homestead without using pebbles, or they substitute steel bars with iron wires or bamboo strips. Roland had seen several "rural villas" spring up during his time in the countryside.



And he intended to follow suit, after all, it was just a three-story building, and it would be hard to collapse no matter how much he cut corners.



Furthermore, he hoped that through the witches' residential building project, Karl would master this kind of architectural material that could be freely shaped, like man-made stone. As one of the directions for the development of the construction industry, concrete occupies a significant position. He was not well-versed in architecture, knowing only what little he had learned from the countryside, so broadening the stonemason's horizons and leading him onto the right path was the correct approach.



"Uh... Do you want me to figure this out slowly?" he asked.



"No," Roland said with a slight smile, "that I can teach you."
