## New Architectural Field
The first knighthood ceremony lasted until noon, with Roland, who took on the roles of the award presenter, commentator, and host, standing until the end exhausted. Fortunately, the ceremony finally came to a successful conclusion amidst the ringing of the noon bells and the sound of saluting cannons. He returned to the castle drenched in sweat, and just as he stepped onto the third floor, he saw Anna leaning against the office door with a smile on her face.

"What's going on?"

"You'll know once you go in." She blinked her beautiful lake-blue eyes.



Roland, utterly confused, pushed open the door, only to freeze in place—the twelve witches were neatly lined up in two rows, with Scroll and Wendy at the very front. Upon seeing the prince, everyone simultaneously lifted the hems of their skirts, bent their knees, and bowed in a curtsy.



"Ahem, what is this..."

Scroll was the first to speak, "Your Highness, your actions have proven everything you've said, and the sisters are deeply grateful for this. No words can describe our gratitude, and we ask to continue serving you in the future."



"I see," Roland sighed in relief, "I thought you were all collectively resigning."

"Pfft," Wendy couldn't help but laugh, "How could that be, Your Highness? This is the sacred mountain that witches have longed for in their dreams. As long as you don't drive us away, we hope to live here forever."



"And that is what I wish to see as well... Truly, there is no need for such formalities, as I am not only helping you but also helping myself. Don't be overly solemn; I prefer you all to be relaxed and at ease."



"Hmph, I said there was no need to be so formal," Lily huffed, "Look, he even thinks we're too serious."

"It's not like that, you just agreed immediately too," Miya muttered under her breath, "Traitor!"

"Alright, let's all head to the dining hall first. His Highness still needs to change," Scroll said helplessly, holding her forehead, "By the way, Miss Anna told me you've been going to bed very late recently? Please take care of your health. You mustn't fall before that goal is achieved."

"Don't worry," Roland said with a smile, "I'm in very good health."

After the witches left in single file, only he and Anna remained in the office.

"So, are you also going to express your gratitude to me?" Roland teased her.

"Um... I want to say the same as them," Anna's lips curled into a smile, "‘No words can express my gratitude’."

"And then... hope to always live in Border Town?"

"That's not necessarily the case."



Roland was momentarily stunned, his heart skipped a beat, "Why?"



"Because you won't always stay here," Anna said, tilting her head, "...and no matter where you go, I will always follow you."



A warm current suddenly surged in his heart. Ever since the day he met her, her thoughts had never changed. Whether it was facing the invitation from the Cooperator Society or the dire moments against the demonic beasts, she chose to stand with him.



At that moment, Anna suddenly took two steps forward and gently embraced him.



"Wait, I'm sweaty," Roland reminded her.



The girl did not reply but pressed her head against his chest, seemingly trying to memorize his scent, and took a deep breath. He ultimately gave up the intention to push her away, wrapping his arms around her fair neck and did not let go for a long time.



...



After lunch, Roland took a cold shower and quickly immersed himself in work.



He summoned Karl Van Bate and spread out the detailed map of Border Town, pointing to the position of the Redwater River, "I want to build a bridge here."



"Not a pontoon bridge?" Karl pondered for a moment before speaking, "Forgive my bluntness, Your Highness, but the Redwater River here is nearly a hundred meters wide, and it is almost impossible to build a stone bridge. Even an arch bridge can only span one-third of the distance at most. The flow of the Redwater River is extremely large, and it is impossible to set bridge piers in it. Even stone piles as thick as a person would be knocked over... Apart from raft crossing and pontoon bridges, there isn't a single bridge along the entire river."



"It's not a stone bridge, but a steel bridge," Roland explained, "It will have three spans, with witches handling the central piers. You only need to get the approach bridge in place in advance. However, I want a slope at the end of the bridge to raise the entire bridge body so that inland sailing ships can pass through without their masts hitting the bottom of the bridge."



"Wouldn't that be like setting the bridge up in the sky?" Karl exclaimed in surprise.



"It's only about six or seven meters above the ground," he said, sketching a rough diagram of the three-span steel bridge on paper, "In order to better develop the south bank in the future, as well as construct shipyards, it is essential to have a bridge that does not hinder navigation. Although pontoon bridges are simple, they essentially block the river, which is unfavorable for subsequent development."



The First Army's expedition to the capital gave Roland many inspirations—he found that the rivers within the borders of Greycastle crisscrossed, with major cities built alongside several main waterways. If they were to conduct operations within the territory in the future, having several shallow-water heavy gunboats would undoubtedly be a powerful tool for fire support and siege warfare—after all, the might of naval guns, known for their caliber, could not be matched by field artillery. And to build ships, he first needed a shipyard, hence the plan for the steel bridge emerged.



"But I don't have any experience in building such bridges..." Karl seemed hesitant.



"Neither do I," Roland shrugged, "We'll just have to explore it slowly for the first time. You can first set up the bridge on the shore for testing, and once there is no problem, then move it to the Redwater River," he casually imparted the concept of overall prefabrication and one-time hoisting construction to Karl, "Just like installing a water tower, with the Hummingbird lightening its weight, and with your student Anna to help with assembly and welding, it won't be too difficult."



"I obey... Your Highness," he nodded.



"In addition, there is another very important project I want to entrust to you," the prince moved his finger to the area of the castle, "I plan to expand the size of the backyard, enclosing all the open space on the high ground into it, and building a three-story building here."



If everything goes well, next month Tilly's five witches will arrive at Border Town, and there are no spare guest rooms left in the castle. Although they could temporarily adjust to having three people per room, the number of witches will always continue to increase, so it’s not possible to keep making do like this. Superior living conditions and a variety of novel and comfortable experiences are also part of my strategy to retain the witches. Whether it's the difficulty of transitioning from luxury to frugality in ancient times or the modern theory of the sugar-coated bullet, a beautiful and comfortable life can always make people indulge in it.

"A three-story... brick house?"

"It's not entirely a brick building," Roland smiled, "Its name should be called reinforced concrete structure, with columns and beams made of reinforced concrete, just like the skeleton of a person. This structure allows houses to be built higher, and it will be no problem to add up to four or five stories later."

"Reinforced... concrete?" Karl repeated, puzzled.

"It's a mixture of cement, sand, and gravel, with steel bars embedded in it to enhance its bending resistance," he explained, "Of course, the specific amount of each ingredient needs to be rigorously tested. If configured successfully, it can even be stronger than natural bluestone."

In theory, this material has a very large quality elasticity. Concrete is not the same everywhere; what you buy in the countryside and mix yourself is completely different from what is proportioned at a mixing station. The same goes for the steel bars... Some people even build their houses on homesteads without gravel, or they use iron wires or bamboo strips instead of steel bars. Roland had seen several "rural villas" spring up in the countryside.

And he planned to emulate this, after all, it was just a three-story building, and it would be hard to collapse even with some corner-cutting in construction.

Furthermore, he hoped that through the witch residence project, Karl could master this kind of building material that can change shape at will, as perfect as man-made stone. As one of the directions for the development of the construction industry, concrete occupies a significant place. He was not proficient in architecture; what he knew was just the superficial knowledge learned from the countryside, so it was the right approach to broaden the stonemason's horizons and lead them onto the right path.

"Uh... So, should I explore this gradually?" he asked.



"No," Roland said with a slight smile, "this I can teach you."
