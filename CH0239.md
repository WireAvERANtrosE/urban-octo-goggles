## Midnight Snack
After dinner, Anna walked into the kitchen with a big bag of Bird Beak Mushrooms.



These pristine mushrooms were collected from the Misty Forest at the request of Maggie—unlike ordinary mushrooms, Bird Beak Mushrooms usually grow at the tops of huge trees, living off the nutrients of the trees, and are also a favorite food of some flying creatures. Although they taste exceptionally delicious and the thick stalks are as tender as succulent meat, their high growth position makes them hard to notice from the ground, and there are not many people willing to climb each tall tree in search of them.



Her mother would always gather some for her on her birthday, no matter how few, and make two mushroom dishes to celebrate. Compared to moldy coarse bread and bland wheat porridge, that unique flavor was unforgettable. Even though she no longer had to worry about going hungry and the food had become much more abundant each day, she still wanted to personally make those two dishes that could only be tasted in the Western Territory's small town and share them with Prince Roland, who had been busy working late every day recently.



The stove in the kitchen had already been extinguished, but that was not a problem for Anna. She threw the firewood into the stove, summoned Blackfire, and soon the flames in the furnace were burning vigorously.



At this moment, Nightingale suddenly popped out from the wall, "Eh, what are you doing?"



"I'm making some food for His Highness, he has been going to bed very late recently. And you?"



"Ahaha," she scratched the back of her head, "I just wanted to find some snacks... I'm a bit hungry," she paused, then curiously leaned in, "What are you planning to make?"



"Um... Honey-roasted mushrooms and mushroom soup," Anna opened the bundle, revealing the Bird Beak Mushrooms inside, "They are all special foods from Border Town, do you want to try them?"



Nightingale nodded and quickly added, "Can you teach me how to make them... I also want to learn how to make this."



"Sure," Anna said with a smile, "it's quite easy."



After slicing the mushrooms, she grabbed a handful and gave them to Nightingale, "First, spread a layer of butter evenly on both sides of the mushrooms, then place them over the fire to carefully toast them until they are golden brown on both sides. Be careful not to overcook them, or they will turn black."



"Mhm," Nightingale took the mushroom slices and, imitating Anna, she spread grease on both sides, "Has His Highness been working late recently?"



"Yes, in order to settle the refugees and to draw up some new machinery blueprints, he goes to bed almost every night after midnight. Several times, when I passed by the office, I could still see light coming through the crack under the door," Anna nodded, "Having been away for nearly half a month, you must miss His Highness, right?"



Nightingale's hand trembled slightly, and the mushroom fell into the butter, "Uh... well... not really..."



"It's not just you. Lightning, Lily, Echo, and Wendy all miss His Highness. They said there wasn't even a place to bathe over there and have been wanting to come back for a long time," Anna suddenly noticed that the other person's expression was a bit strange, "Hey, what's wrong?"



"No," she shook her head, picked up the mushroom, and gave an embarrassed smile, "So it turns out, indeed... I miss him quite a bit."



"Right?" Anna, holding the greased mushrooms with her fingers, reached into the flames, "If I were away from His Highness for half a month, no, maybe just a few days, I would be eager to see him again."



Her encounter with Roland Wimbledon in the dungeon was the most incredible moment of her life. To this day, when she recalls it, she still feels warmth and gratitude in her heart. If it weren't for His Highness, even if she could continue to live, her life would be filled with ignorance and confusion, just like those numb townspeople.



His Highness taught her the wonders of this world, whether it was pepper steak drenched in sauce or "The Basics of Natural Science Theory," his presence added something new to her life, making her finally feel not the same as others, but a unique witch.



The other sisters must think the same—once you spend enough time with His Highness, it's impossible not to fall for his ingenious ideas and unique charm, a point Anna firmly believed in.



"Ah, did I roast this too long?" Nightingale lifted the iron fork, one side of the mushroom already turning brown.



"A bit..." she couldn't help but laugh, "Bird's Beak Mushrooms are quite delicate, so the grilling time must be just right, you'll get the hang of it after a few more tries. I'll go get the stew ingredients ready."



Nightingale dipped the slightly burnt mushroom in honey and salt, tossing it into her mouth, "Hmm, it's still pretty delicious." Watching the girl skillfully mix various herbs and ingredients together, she asked curiously, "Did you often do this before?"



"Yes, pickling food, grinding flour, working short jobs for the nobility, helping the neighbors wash and shear their sheep," Anna said, "Apart from attending classes at Teacher Karl's academy, I spent most of my time doing these things." She paused, "But after my mother passed away, my father never let me go back to the academy, nor did he allow me to leave the house."



"I'm sorry..."



"It's nothing, it's all in the past," Anna's eyes shone brightly, like a cerulean lake under moonlight, "Compared to many witches, I'm already very fortunate, aren't I?"



The mushrooms smeared with fat curled slightly under the flame, making a faint sizzling sound. Sprinkled with a bit of salt and flipped twice, you could smell the enticing aroma, the buttery milk smell mixed with the unique flavor of the Bird's Beak Mushrooms, making one's mouth water. The final touch was to swirl it around the honey jar, completing a piece of roasted mushroom. Both the Bird's Beak Mushrooms and the honey could be harvested from the Misty Forest, and for the locals, if during logging they happened to cut down a tree with both a beehive and Bird's Beak Mushrooms at the top, that was considered an extremely lucky day.



As the clay pot used for stewing soup spouted plumes of white steam, the two of them also finished their respective tasks of grilling mushrooms and seasoning.

"All done, at least it looks pretty good," Nightingale stuffed another piece into her mouth, "It turns out I have quite the talent for cooking... Pfft, this piece is a bit too salty though."

"The timing is almost perfect," Anna glanced at the night sky outside the window, "Let's bring it to His Highness."

"Could you please help me take it to him?" she asked with her hands clasped together, "I'd appreciate it."

"Aren't you coming with me?"

"No," she said with a smile, "because I don't know what kind of face to show when I see him now."

Anna paused, and before she could ask what that meant, the other person had already vanished into thin air. Is the expression really that important? A smile, a look of disappointment, or an expressionless face would all do. Even when she had just come out of the prison, having lost faith in everything and feeling utterly dejected, His Highness had not found her presence bothersome, so why avoid him? Unable to figure it out, she shook her head, picked up the plate and soup bowl by herself, and walked towards the office.
