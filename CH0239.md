## Nightfall
After dinner, Anna carried a large bag of bird beak mushrooms into the kitchen.

These pristine mushrooms were picked from the Misty Forest at the request of Maggie—unlike ordinary mushrooms, bird beak mushrooms usually grow at the tops of large trees, subsisting on the nutrients from the trees, and are also a favorite food of some birds. Although their taste is extremely delicious and the thick stalks are as tender as lean meat, due to their high growing location and being hardly noticeable from below, there are not many people willing to climb up each tree to search and pick them.

Her mother would always pick some, more or less, on her birthday and make two mushroom dishes to celebrate, which were far more memorable than the moldy coarse bread and the bland and tasteless wheat porridge. Although she no longer had to worry about going hungry and her daily meals had become much richer, she still wanted to personally make these two dishes that could only be tasted in the Western Region small town and share them with Prince Roland, who had been busy working late every day.

The kitchen stove had already been extinguished, but this was not a problem for Anna. She threw firewood into the stove and summoned the black fire, and soon the flames in the furnace were burning vigorously.

Just at that moment, Nightingale suddenly popped out from the wall, "Eh, what are you doing?"

"I want to make some food for His Highness; he has been going to bed very late recently. What about you?"

"Ahaha," she scratched the back of her head, "I just wanted to find some snacks... I'm a bit hungry," she paused, then curiously leaned in, "What are you planning to make?"

"Um... honey roasted mushrooms and mushroom soup," Anna opened the bundle, revealing the bird beak mushrooms inside, "These are specialties of Border Town, would you like to try some?"

Nightingale nodded, then quickly added, "Could you teach me how to make it... I also want to learn to prepare this."



"Sure," Anna said with a smile, "It's quite easy."

After slicing the mushrooms, she grabbed a handful and handed them to Nightingale, "First, spread butter evenly on both sides of the mushrooms, then carefully roast them over the fire until they are golden brown on both sides. Be careful not to roast them for too long, or they will burn."



"Okay," Nightingale took the mushroom slices and, imitating Anna, smeared fat on both sides of them, "Has His Highness been working late recently?"



"Yes, in order to settle the refugees and draft some new machine blueprints, he's been going to bed past midnight almost every day. A few times when I passed by the office, I could still see light seeping out from under the door," Anna nodded, "Having been away for nearly half a month, you must miss His Highness, right?"



Nightingale's hand trembled slightly, and the mushroom fell into the butter, "Um... well, not really..."



"It's not just you. Lightning, Lily, Echo, and Wendy all miss His Highness. They said there wasn't even a place to bathe there, and they've been longing to return for a while," Anna suddenly noticed that Nightingale looked a bit strange, "Huh, what's wrong?"



"No," she shook her head, picked up the mushroom, and smiled a little embarrassedly, "So that's how it is... Indeed... I do miss him quite a bit."



"Right," Anna said, pinching the buttered mushroom and reaching into the flames with her bare hand, "If I were away from His Highness for half a month, no, maybe just for a few days, I would be eager to see him again."



Her encounter with Roland Wimbledon in the dungeon was the most incredible moment of her life, and even thinking back on it today, she still felt her heart filled with warmth and gratitude. If it wasn't for His Highness, even if she could have continued to live, she would have lived in ignorance and confusion, just like those numb townspeople.



His Highness taught her the wonders of this world, be it the pepper steak drenched in sauce or the "Fundamentals of Natural Science Theory." His presence had infused something new into her life, making her feel that she was no longer like everyone else, but a unique witch.



She was sure the other sisters felt the same way—after spending time with His Highness, it was impossible not to be drawn into his ingenious ideas and unique charm. Of this, Anna was certain.



"Ah, did I grill this for too long?" Nightingale lifted the iron fork, one side of the mushroom had turned a charred yellow.



"A bit..." she couldn't help but laugh, "Bird's Beak Mushrooms are quite delicate, so the grilling time must be just right, not too long, not too short. You'll get the hang of it after a few tries. I'll prepare the ingredients for the stew."



Nightingale dipped the slightly burnt mushroom in honey and salt, then popped it into her mouth, "Mmm, still tastes good." She watched the girl skillfully mix various herbs and ingredients together and asked curiously, "Did you use to do this a lot?"



"Mm, pickling food, grinding wheat, working odd jobs for the nobles, helping the neighbors bathe and shear their sheep," Anna said, "Apart from attending classes at Teacher Karl's academy, I spent most of my time doing these things." She paused, "But after my mother passed away, my father never allowed me to go back to the academy, or even to leave the house."



"I'm sorry..."



"That's alright, it's all in the past," Anna's eyes shone bright, like a lake under the moonlight, "Compared to many other witches, I'm already very lucky, aren't I?"



The buttered mushroom slices curled slightly in the flames, making a soft crackling sound. Sprinkled with a bit of salt and flipped twice, one could smell the enticing aroma. The milk scent of the heated butter mixed with the unique flavor of the Bird's Beak Mushroom was mouthwatering. Finally, twirling the honey jar around to complete a grilled mushroom. Both the Bird's Beak Mushroom and the honey could be gathered from the Hide and Seek Forest. For the locals, if they happened to fell a tree that had both a beehive and Bird's Beak Mushrooms at the top, it was considered an extremely lucky day.



As the clay pot for stewing soup emitted puffs of white steam, the two of them completed their respective tasks of grilling mushrooms and seasoning.



"All done, at least it looks alright," Nightingale shoved another piece into her mouth, "Turns out I have quite a talent for cooking...oops, this piece is a bit too salty."



"The timing is just about perfect," Anna glanced out at the night sky, "Let's take it to His Highness."



"Could you help me deliver it to him?" she put her hands together in a plea, "Please."



"Aren't you coming with me?"



"No," she laughed, "Because I don't know what kind of expression I should wear when I see him now."



Anna paused, but before she could ask what that meant, the other person had already vanished into thin air. Are expressions that important? A smile, a look of dejection, or a blank face would all do. Even when she had just come out from the prison, having lost all faith and hope in everything, it had not annoyed His Highness. Why avoid him then? Unable to figure it out, she shook her head and walked alone with the plate and soup bowl towards the office.
