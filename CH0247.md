## Graduation Ceremony
"Look, that's Scroll," Piper elbowed Gilli quietly, "I heard she's the Minister of Education."

"Minister of... Education?" the latter asked puzzledly, "What’s that?"

"It's the person in charge of the teachers. Don't you like Teacher Phyllis the most and hate the loud-mouthed Haben?" Piper explained, "Whether it's Phyllis or Haben, they are all managed by Scroll."

"Where did you hear all this?" Gilli blinked, "Is it from that big shot you always talk about?"

"Humph, of course," he smiled proudly, "And that's not all I know. Today, not only will officials from the City Hall attend the graduation ceremony, but even Lord Barov himself will come to the academy. Prince Roland will be there!"

"Really?" the little girl's eyes lit up, "Will the prince speak to us?"

"Uh... I don't know about that," Piper scratched the back of his head, "Probably."

After all, he had heard it from Big Brother Vanner—speaking of Vanner, he was quite the figure. Originally just a common stone splitter in Old Street, he immediately became a squad leader in charge of several people after joining the militia. Now, he is an officer of the First Army Artillery Squad, earning twenty-five Silver Royals a month, and has even shaken hands and spoken with Prince Roland!

Although he mostly lived in the barracks, whenever he did come back, he always brought back many novel and interesting stories and experiences. During these times, Piper would seek him out to pester with questions. As Vanner's former neighbor and admirer, Piper often got to know quite a bit of news ahead of others from him.



For example, the fact that the lord would attend the graduation ceremony was personally told to me by Vanner—As early as one week before, the First Army had received orders to protect and be on alert, and they even conducted a drill near the academy building.



Sure enough, it wasn't long before a team of spirited, neatly dressed soldiers marched over with their heads held high, and among them were His Highness the Prince and his Chief Knight.



A commotion inevitably arose among the crowd.



After the soldiers had surrounded the entrance to the academy building, Roland entered the hall and waved to the students lined up in rows, "My subjects, hello. I am Roland Wimbledon, the lord of Border Town and ruler of the Western Territory. Congratulations on completing the full content of the elementary education popularization and becoming the first batch of graduates from our town."



The crowd fell silent, not out of indifference, but because most of them were too excited to know what to say.



Gilly continuously pinched Piper's arm, exclaiming, "His Highness is talking to us!"



Piper felt equally exhilarated, thinking that now he, like big brother Vanner, had also come into close contact with His Highness.



"The reason you were able to pass the assessments so quickly and arrive at graduation is that most of you were once students of Teacher Karl Barton, and from the beginning, you were much ahead of others. So do not become arrogant or complacent; there is still so much knowledge in this world waiting for you to explore and discover," Roland continued, "Of course, this day still deserves celebration. From today onward, you have set out on a path that is entirely different from others. Whatever work you choose to undertake, you will receive generous rewards. I hereby congratulate you!"



"Long live His Highness!" someone shouted first, and then everyone else excitedly joined in, "Long live His Highness! I am willing to serve His Highness!"



Waiting for the cheers to subside, Roland smiled and said, "Next, I will hand out the diplomas to you as a testament to the honor of completing your studies." He opened a booklet, "Paper."



Paper felt a shiver run through him as he looked at the prince, mouth agape, not knowing what to say. It was Teacher Phyllis Cilt who beckoned to him, "Don't be afraid, come forward to His Highness."



He walked stiffly out of line, hearing his own heart thumping wildly, when suddenly he remembered the military salute that Fanner often mentioned—much simpler than the noble knight's salute and it could express his loyalty, and it was even invented by His Highness himself. Despite not being entirely sure of the exact pose, he mustered his courage and raised his hand firmly to his forehead as he remembered.



This action amused the prince, who nodded and handed the booklet to Paper, "If you move your hand a little further back to the edge of your ear, it will be more standard... Congratulations on graduating."



"Tha... Thank you," Paper took the booklet, almost woodenly walking back to line. It wasn't until His Highness started handing out diplomas to others that he came to his senses.



"Let me see, what does it say on it?" Gilli asked curiously, leaning over.



"You have one too, what's the rush." He muttered under his breath, his hands trembling as he opened the cover of the diploma, inside was sewn a piece of exquisite parchment. In the upper left corner was his own portrait, in the center was the royal crest of the Greycastle Longspears, and there were several lines of text. If it had been half a year ago, he would have had to find Teacher Karl to explain the meaning of these characters to him, but now, Paper was able to do the most basic reading and writing, he silently read it to himself—



"Border Town Academy First Batch Graduate: Paper."



"Principal: Scroll."



"Issuer: Lord of Border Town, Roland Wimbledon."

...

Once all the diplomas were distributed, Roland clapped his hands, drawing everyone's attention. "From now on, you are capable of undertaking jobs that ordinary people find difficult to manage. These jobs come with generous rewards, starting at no less than ten Silver Royals per month. Now, I would like to invite Lady Scroll to introduce the job opportunities available at the Border Town City Hall." He raised his hand to silence the discussion. "You don't need to make a decision immediately. You can go back and discuss it with your families. Once you've decided, just bring your ID and diploma to the City Hall to apply."



While Lady Scroll was introducing the opportunities, Gilly leaned over and asked, "Have you made up your mind? I'm thinking of working at the bicycle factory. The pay is higher than my father's, and there's a chance to get a new bicycle for free!"

"That does sound great," Piper replied nonchalantly. Recently, four huge wooden boards had been erected in the town square, each bearing portraits of His Highness and several ministers. The ministers' peculiar iron steeds below them had sparked lively discussions among the townspeople. Moreover, the bicycle factory's salary was fifteen Silver Royals a month, and if it weren't for the requirement that only those who had completed primary education could apply, it would probably be packed already.



But Piper had another place in mind.

Ever since attending the awarding ceremony, Piper couldn't suppress the thought—he too wanted to stand on the high platform in the square like his former classmate Nana, to receive honor personally bestowed by His Highness in front of thousands.

According to the prince, only those who made outstanding contributions to the town were eligible for the award. If he worked at the bicycle factory, he feared he would never have that opportunity. He didn't think he could lead troops into battle and charge into the fray like Iron Axe, nor did he possess the incredible abilities of a witch. The only one he could emulate was Chief Alchemist, Kyle Sichi.

He had heard more than once before that if he could fumble out a practical alchemical product, it would bring great wealth and prestige to the territory, earning the name of a sage. It didn't require bravery or a noble bloodline, just a little bit of luck... There was no path more suitable for him than this.



With this thought in mind, Paper made up her mind.

"I want to sign up to go to the chemical laboratory," she said, word by word.
