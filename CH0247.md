## Graduation Ceremony
"Look, that's Scroll," Pipe elbowed Gilli quietly, "I heard she's the Minister of Education."

"Education... Minister?" the latter asked curiously, "What's that?"

"It's the person in charge of teachers. You like Teacher Philip the most and hate the loud-mouthed Hawn the least," Pipe explained, "Whether it's Philip or Hawn, they are both managed by Scroll."

"Where did you hear all this?" Gilli blinked, "Is it from that important person you talk about?"

"Humph, of course," he said proudly with a smile, "And I know more than just that. Not only will officials from the City Hall attend today's graduation ceremony, but even Lord Barov himself will come to the academy, Prince Roland too!"

"Really?" the little girl's eyes lit up, "Will the prince speak to us?"

"Uh... I don't know about that," Pipe scratched the back of his head, "Probably."

After all, he had heard it from Brother Tanner—speaking of Tanner, he's quite a figure. Originally just a common stone breaker on Old Street, he joined the Militia and immediately became the leader of a small team. Now, he's an officer in the First Army's Artillery Battalion, earning a salary of twenty-five Silver Royals a month, and he has even shaken hands and talked with Prince Roland!

Although he mostly lives in the barracks, whenever he does come back, he always brings many novel and interesting stories and experiences. During such times, Pipe would pester him with questions, and as Tanner's former neighbor and admirer, Pipe often could get a lot of news from him in advance.



For instance, the fact that Lord would attend the graduation ceremony was personally told to him by Tanner—A week earlier, the First Army received orders for protection and vigilance, and even conducted an exercise near the academy building.



Sure enough, it wasn't long before a troop of spirited soldiers, dressed uniformly, marched over with heads held high, with the two people in the middle being none other than His Highness the Prince and his Chief Knight.

A stir inevitably arose among the crowd.

After the soldiers surrounded the entrance to the academy building, Roland entered the hall and waved to the rows of students, "My people, greetings. I am the Lord of Border Town, the ruler of the Western Territory, Roland Wimbledon. Congratulations on completing the basic education for all, becoming the first batch of graduates of our town."

The crowd fell into a stunned silence—not out of indifference, but because most were so excited they didn't know what to say.

Jill kept pinching Piper's arm, saying, "The Prince is talking to us!"

Piper felt equally exhilarated; this way, he too, like big brother Tanner, had come into close contact with His Highness.

"The reason you were able to pass the assessment so quickly and reach graduation is that most of you were once students of Teacher Karl Barton, and from the very beginning, you were far ahead of others. So do not be complacent, there is still much knowledge in this world waiting for you to explore and discover," Roland continued, "Of course, this day is still worth celebrating. From today onwards, you have embarked on a path completely different from others. Whatever job you commit to, you can expect a generous reward. I hereby offer you my congratulations!"

"Long live the Prince!" someone shouted first, followed by the others who excitedly cried out, "Long live the Prince! I am willing to serve His Highness!"



As the cheering subsided, Roland smiled and said, "Next, I will hand out the diplomas to you as proof of your academic achievements." He opened a small booklet, "Piper."



Piper felt a shiver run through his body. He looked at the prince, opened his mouth, but didn't know what to say. It was Teacher Philip Eltek who beckoned to him, "Don't be afraid, come forward to His Highness."



His limbs stiff, he walked out of the line, the pounding of his heart audible to himself. Suddenly, he remembered the military salute that Tanner often mentioned—much simpler than the noble knight's salute, but also able to express one's loyalty, and it was even a ritual invented by His Highness himself. Although not quite sure of the exact posture, he mustered the courage and raised his hand to his forehead as he remembered.



The prince was amused by this gesture, nodded, and handed the booklet to Piper, "If you move your hand further back, to the edge of your ear, it will be more standard... Congratulations on your graduation."



"Th-thank you," Piper took the booklet, almost woodenly walking back to the line. It was not until the prince began to issue diplomas to the others that he finally came to his senses.



"Let me see, what does it say?" Gilli asked curiously, leaning over.



"You have one too, what's the rush," he muttered softly, his hands trembling as he opened the cover of the diploma, revealing a beautifully sewn piece of parchment inside. In the upper left corner was his portrait, in the middle was the royal crest of Greycastle long spears, and there were several lines of text. If it had been six months ago, he would have had to ask Teacher Karl to tell him the meaning of these characters, but now, Piper could do the most basic reading and writing, and he silently read it to himself—



"Border Town Academy's first graduating class: Piper."

"Dean: Scroll."



"Issuer: The Lord of Border Town, Roland Wimbledon."

...

Once all the graduation certificates had been handed out, Roland clapped his hands to draw everyone's attention, "Starting from now, you are all capable of undertaking jobs that ordinary people find difficult to fulfill. These jobs come with generous compensation, starting from at least ten Silver Royals per month. Next, I would like to ask Lady Scroll to introduce the job opportunities available at the Border Town City Hall." He raised his hand to stop the discussion, "There is no need to make a decision right away. You can go back and discuss it with your families first. Once you've made a decision, bring your ID and graduation certificate to the City Hall to apply."



While Lady Scroll was introducing the jobs, Jill leaned in to ask, "Have you made up your mind? I want to work at the bicycle factory. The pay is higher than my dad's, and there's a chance to get a new bicycle for free!"

"That sounds great," Pipe responded nonchalantly. Recently, four huge wooden billboards had been erected in the town square, bearing portraits of His Highness and several ministers. The townspeople were having animated discussions about the oddly shaped iron steeds depicted beneath the figures. Moreover, the bicycle factory's salary was fifteen Silver Royals per month, and if it weren't for the requirement that only those who had completed primary education could apply, it would have been overwhelmed with applicants long ago.

But he had his sights set on another place.

Ever since attending the award ceremony, Pipe couldn't suppress the thought—he too wanted to one day stand on the high platform in the square and receive the honor bestowed personally by His Highness, just like his former classmate Nana.

According to Prince Roland, only those who made outstanding contributions to the town were eligible for knighthood. Working at the bicycle factory would likely mean missing that opportunity for life. He knew he couldn't lead troops into battle or charge into enemy lines like Iron Axe, nor did he have the incredible abilities of a witch. The only path he could follow was that of Chief Alchemist Kyle Sichi.

He had heard more than once that if one could come up with a practical alchemical product, it could bring immense wealth and prestige to the territory, earning the title of a sage. It required no bravery or lineage, just a little bit of luck... There was no path more suitable for him than this.



Thinking of this, Paper made up his mind.

"I want to sign up for the chemical laboratory," he said, word by word.
