## Firearms Practice
"Lies upon lies," Nightingale spoke up as Roland returned to his office after dealing with the alchemist, "What ancient book from 450 years ago? Isn't 'Elementary Chemistry' a textbook you wrote for the memory of scrolls? That thing is going to be taught to the townsfolk sooner or later, right?"

"A benevolent lie," Roland picked up his cup and took a sip of tea—ever since the capital's merchant, Margaret, had given him a pack of black tea, he could finally say goodbye to drinking plain water or beer every day, "How could a prince living in the palace know so much about alchemy? If he did, it would be from the instruction of alchemists from the capital. Giving him a textbook to study on his own is more acceptable than me teaching him alchemy, after all, people always believe in themselves the most."

"Oh?" Nightingale suddenly leaned forward, getting close to Roland's face, "Then, who taught you all your knowledge?"

"Uh..." Roland was about to speak when Nightingale pressed her finger against his lips, "If you don't want to say it, then don't. I don't want to hear you lie."

He blinked, and only then did she withdraw her hand.

"Taking advantage of the five days left before the contest," Roland quickly changed the subject, "We need to let Carter get familiar with the new weapon ahead of time."

"But didn't you say that the ammunition problem hasn't been resolved yet?"

"The issue with the gun cotton only affects its practical use. If it's just to cope with the contest, each gun can still manage to fire a round. After all, during the contest, there's no need to consider transporting bullets and reloading repeatedly, ten bullets are enough to get results." Roland said. Of course, the reduction in firing rate due to the lack of gun cotton was a matter of probability, and that was something to be left to fate and Carter's luck.

To the west of the town wall.
Carter arrived at the previous explosive testing ground to take on the new task assigned by Roland.
"Fight against a witch?" The Chief Knight was stunned. "May I wear the Divine Stone of Judgement?"
"Of course," Roland said with a smile, "but the witch you will face is a special one, the Divine Stone of Judgement is ineffective against her, and her combat style is similar to that of a warrior, attacking with a greatsword."
"You mean, she's a witch who's proficient in close combat?" Carter glanced at Nightingale beside Roland.
"Pretty much, but since her ability is to enhance herself, both her strength and speed far exceed that of an ordinary person," Roland explained. "You need to be mentally prepared. The physical abilities of your opponent are probably several times higher than those of the convicts previously used for testing the pills."
"Several times higher... Your Highness, do you realize what that means?" Carter's eyes widened. "I might notice her movements, but my body wouldn't be able to keep up with the reaction. If she is as powerful as you say, I'm afraid I might not be able to defeat her."
"Theoretically, your chances of winning are indeed zero," the prince handed over a strangely shaped firearm, "but with this, your chances of victory will increase significantly."
"Is this... a new musket?" Carter received it with both hands—since its trigger and barrel parts were very similar to the flintlock gun, the knight deduced that they must belong to the same category of weapons. It was not large, but felt heavy in his hands, even heavier than a flintlock rifle. What was particularly striking was that, apart from the wooden grip, the entire body of the gun was made of metal, with smooth lines and corners, and a grey-white metallic luster, there was an indescribable beauty to it.

Carter took a liking to the weapon almost instantly.

"It's called a revolver," Roland said as he pulled out another weapon of the same design and flicked out a wheel that resembled a honeycomb to the left. "Now, let me teach you how to use it."

Carter quickly discovered that its operation was simpler than that of a flintlock gun. The bullets and gunpowder were already combined into one unit, and all that was needed was to load them into the central wheel to fire. The wheel had five chambers, which allowed for five rounds to be loaded at once, and this was probably the reason it was called a revolver. There was a small hole at the rear of the gun, corresponding to the position of the wheel. When the trigger was pulled, sparks would burst out of this hole, accompanied by a hissing friction sound. Perhaps there was a flint hidden inside, he thought. However, the design of the bullet was too exquisite; the light yellow casing was probably made from thin copper sheets, perfectly round in shape, smooth all over, and without any visible seams. The bullet was tapered, thicker at the back and about the thickness of an index finger, fitting extremely precisely into the chamber holes. How on earth was this made?

"This is an unfinished product, so you have to be careful with the opening at the bottom of the bullet," Roland made a shooting gesture, "Like this, point the muzzle slightly downward, so as not to let the gunpowder leak out from the opening. After each shot, you need to clean out the chambers in the wheel to prevent loose gunpowder from accumulating in the holes."

"Unfinished product?"

"Yes," the prince shrugged, "There's a key technology still to be resolved. If all goes well, you might catch up before the competition. The opening at the bottom of the bullet will be sealed, and you won't have to worry about powder leakage anymore. Let's try shooting at a target first."

If the bottom is sealed, how would the gunpowder inside the bullet ignite? Carter pondered for a moment, then decided to give up thinking about this seemingly impossible problem. After all, he didn't have the extensive knowledge and talent of His Highness.

Indeed, extensive knowledge and talent. Carter now admired Prince Roland Wimbledon to the point of complete reverence. Whether it was court scholars, alchemists, or astrologers, none could invent as many peculiar and strange things as His Highness, and all of these inventions had a high practical value. They were not like the snow powder or manned kites, which only ended up as noble's toys. His Highness's steam engine was already being used in mining operations and water extraction, and the firearms and cannons had repelled the demonic beasts and the Duke's allied army. Now Carter firmly believed that given time, the one to ascend the throne of Greycastle would inevitably be His Highness Roland Wimbledon.

The target was set up fifteen meters away; at this distance, the human-shaped target was only the size of a palm. He held the gun with both hands, as His Highness had taught, slightly tilted his body to align the barrel's sight with the target, and pulled the trigger.

Sparks and gas spewed out from both sides of the cylinder, the loud noise causing a painful ringing in his ears. It felt as if someone had pushed him hard, causing his wrist to lift unconsciously. When the gun smoke cleared, the target appeared to be completely intact.

"Continue," Roland said.

Carter took a deep breath and fired the remaining four bullets, but not a single one hit the target.

"This..." Carter looked towards His Highness, who did not seem to mind.

"The pistol, due to its short barrel, has less range and accuracy than a rifle. It's very normal to miss the target. Moreover, with a bullet caliber close to twelve millimeters, the recoil is much greater than that of a flintlock," he began to explain in terms Carter found difficult to understand, "In any case, just practice the way I told you. Before the competition, you must be able to hit the target with all five shots if you want a chance to win. Oh, and... don't forget to collect the casings. They can be reloaded and used many times over."
