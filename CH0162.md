## Firearms Practice
"Lies upon lies," Nightingale spoke out when Roland returned to his office after dealing with the alchemist's matter, "What about that ancient book from 450 years ago? 'Elementary Chemistry' is a textbook you wrote for memorizing scrolls, isn't it? That stuff is going to be taught to the common people sooner or later, right?"



"It's just a white lie," Roland picked up his cup and took a sip of tea—ever since the merchant from the capital, Margaret, had given him a packet of black tea, he finally could bid farewell to drinking plain water or beer every day, "How could a prince living in the palace know so much about alchemy? If he did, it would have been from the teachings of the alchemists from the capital. Giving him a textbook to study on his own is more acceptable than me teaching him alchemy. People always believe most in themselves, after all."



"Oh?" Nightingale suddenly leaned forward, inching closer to Roland's face, "Then who taught you all your knowledge?"



"Uh..." Just as Roland opened his mouth, Nightingale pressed a finger against it, "If you don't want to say, then don't. I don't want to hear you lie."



He blinked, and only then did she withdraw her hand.



"Taking advantage of the five days left before the competition," Roland quickly changed the subject, "we should have Carter get familiar with the operation of the new weapons in advance."



"But didn't you say that the ammunition problem hasn't been resolved yet?"



"The fulminating powder only affects its practical use. If it's just for the competition, each gun can still fire a round. After all, during the competition, there's no need to worry about transporting bullets and reloading repeatedly—ten bullets are enough to get a result," Roland said. Of course, the drop in the firing rate due to the lack of fulminating powder was a matter of probability, and that was something that had to be left to fate and Carter's luck.



To the west of the town walls.



Carter arrived at the previous explosives testing ground to undertake the new task assigned to him by Roland.



"To fight against a witch?" The Chief Knight was startled, "May I wear the God's Stone of Retribution?"



"Of course, you can," Roland said with a smile, "but you'll be facing a special witch. The God's Stone of Retribution is ineffective against her, and her combat style is similar to that of a warrior, attacking with a great sword."



"Do you mean that she is a witch skilled in close combat?" Carter glanced at Nightingale beside Roland.



"Pretty much, but since her ability is to enhance herself, her strength and speed far exceed that of an ordinary person," Roland explained. "Prepare yourself mentally; her physical condition is likely several times higher than that of the criminals used for the pill testing before."



"Several times higher... Your Highness, do you realize what that means?" Carter's eyes widened, "It's very likely that even if I observe her movements, my body won't be able to keep up with the reaction. If she's as powerful as you say, I'm afraid I won't be able to defeat her."



"Theoretically, your chances of winning are indeed zero," the prince handed over a strangely shaped firearm, "but with this, your chances of victory will increase significantly."



"Is this... a new musket?" Carter took it with both hands—because its trigger and barrel were very similar to flintlock guns, the knight judged that they must belong to the same category of weapon. It was not large, but it felt heavy in his hand, even heavier than a flintlock rifle. Particularly striking was that aside from the wooden grip, the entire body of the gun was made of metal, its smooth lines and angles, as well as the gray-white metallic luster, had an indescribable beauty.



Carter took to the weapon almost instantly.



"Its name is the revolver," Roland pulled out another weapon of the same design, and flicked to the left to pop out the wheel that looked like a honeycomb, "Now, I will teach you how to use it."



Carter quickly found that it was simpler to operate than the flintlock, with the bullet and gunpowder already combined into one. All that was needed was to load it into the central wheel to fire. The wheel had five chambers, allowing five rounds to be loaded at once, which was probably why it was called a revolver. At the rear of the pistol, corresponding with the wheel, was a small hole. When the trigger was pulled, a spark would burst from the hole, making a sizzling friction sound. Perhaps there was a piece of flint hidden inside, he thought. However, the design of the bullet was too ingenious; the light yellow shell was probably made of thin copper plate, perfectly round in shape, smooth all over, with no visible seam. The bullet tapered from front to back, with the rear as thick as a finger, fitting precisely into the chamber holes. How on earth was this made?



"This is an unfinished product, so you must always pay attention to the opening at the bottom of the bullet," Roland made a shooting action, "Like this, with the muzzle slightly downward, so as not to let the gunpowder leak from the opening. After each shot, you must clean the bullet nest in the wheel to prevent loose gunpowder from accumulating in the chambers."



"Unfinished product?"



"Yes," the prince shrugged, "There is one key technology that remains to be resolved. If all goes well, you might catch up before the contest. By then, the opening at the bottom of the bullet will be sealed, and you won't have to worry about powder leakage anymore. Let's try shooting at the target first."



If the bottom is sealed, then how would the gunpowder inside the bullet ignite? Carter thought about it, then decided to give up on pondering this seemingly impossible problem. After all, he didn't have the extensive knowledge and talent of His Highness.



That's right, knowledge and talent. Carter was now thoroughly impressed by His Highness, the Fourth Prince. Whether it was a court scholar, an alchemist, or an astrologer, no one could invent as many strange and wonderful things as His Highness did, and all of these inventions were highly practical. They were nothing like snow powder or manned kites, inventions that ended up as mere toys for the nobility. His Highness's steam engines were already being used in mining operations and for pumping water, and the firearms and cannons had even repelled the demonic beasts and the Duke's allied forces. Now Carter firmly believed that given time, it would be Roland Wimbledon who would inevitably ascend to the throne of Greycastle.



The target was set up fifteen meters away, the human-shaped target only the size of a palm at that distance. He followed the prince's instruction to hold the gun with both hands, slightly turned his body to the side, aimed the barrel at the target, and pulled the trigger.



Sparks and gas spewed from both sides of the cylinder, the loud noise causing his ears to ache. It felt as though someone had pushed him hard, and his wrist involuntarily raised upwards. When the smoke cleared, the target appeared to be completely undamaged.

"Continue," Roland said.

Carter took a deep breath and fired the remaining four bullets, but none hit the target.

"This..." Carter turned to look at His Highness, who seemed unconcerned.

"Due to the short barrel of the pistol, its range and accuracy are not as good as a rifle, so missing the target is quite normal. Moreover, with the bullet caliber being close to twelve millimeters, the recoil is also much greater than that of a flintlock," he began to speak again in terms Carter found hard to understand, "In any case, practice well using the method I've told you. Before the contest, you must be able to hit the target with all five shots to stand a chance of winning. Oh, and... don't forget to collect the cartridge cases. They can be reloaded and used many times over."
