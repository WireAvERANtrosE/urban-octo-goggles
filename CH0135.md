## Starting from the basics
"The devils are increasing in number, and we are dwindling. The Holy City of Taquila has fallen, and we are scattered and fleeing. Crossing mountains and rivers, we escape as far from the Gates of Hell as possible. But where can we flee to next time?"



"What do you think?" In the office, Roland closed the Book of Magic and asked Scroll.



"If the knight did not remember wrongly, this is indeed an incredible coincidence," Scroll pondered for a moment. "The content of the treasure map matches the scribbles recorded in ancient books, which indirectly proves that the Church had once built a city deep in the Barbarian Land to resist the devils. And the location marked on the drawing could be the defensive towers, outposts, warehouses, or other facilities they constructed."



"You mean... it's not actually a treasure map?"



"Of course, the Church is not a band of bandits or pirates; they have no need to hide treasure and leave behind a map to facilitate future discovery."



Roland nodded, "That makes sense. So... this is actually a map?"



"Most likely. Although it's unclear why the Church did not record this period of history, I believe that the relics buried in the Eastern Region's forest are not limited to one place," Scroll analyzed. "If the facility marked on this site is merely an above-ground structure, it's unlikely that anything would remain after several centuries. But if it includes something like an underground storeroom, it could very well be another underground relic. Through it, we might find some clues."



"What kind of clues?"



"Why did the Church choose to conceal the existence of devils? Why did they resist the devils yet keep it a closely guarded secret?" She paused, her voice growing a few notes deeper, "And... why did they hunt witches as if they were devils?"



Roland didn't know how to comfort her, so he remained silent for a moment before slowly speaking, "It's a pity that we don't know if his drawing is accurate or not. According to him, the original drawing is so neat it hardly seems hand-drawn."



"Why not let Nightingale take a trip to the knight's residence?"



"That's not appropriate," Roland vetoed, "A family that has managed to pass down a treasure map for hundreds of years likely has their storage room filled with God's Punishment Stones and traps. Let's talk about this later," he gestured with his fingers, forming a triangle, "Anyway, we can't reach that place right now. If we consider the area at the foot of the Northern Slope to be the mining zone, then the location marked by the hexagram is at least fifty kilometers from us, roughly the distance from Border Town to Longsong Stronghold. Apart from Lightning, who can reach there within a day, others would have to walk for two to three days. What if they encounter devils along the way... I don't want you to take any risks."



"You could first let Lightning scout the area from the air; maybe she'll discover something," Scroll suggested.



"That's a viable plan," Roland stood up, "I'll talk to her when she gets back. For now, I need to make a trip to the Northern Slope Mine. You should prepare the teaching materials for the class, and if you need to make multiple copies, find Soraya. We have to continue with their lessons tonight."



Roland combined the elementary education he received in school with the court education method of the Four Princes and imparted them all to Scroll, including categorization memory, phonetic writing, and memorization of word groups. With these, he believed she would become an excellent teacher.



"Yes, Your Highness," Scroll responded with a bow.



The backyard of the Northern Slope mining area's smelting room had expanded more than twice compared to before, with two holes dug out and not yet filled on the ground. The cannon blanks for the twelve-pounder were cast here. When Roland arrived at the backyard, Anna was practicing her new ability, and on the table, there were two items that looked like steel tubes.



He casually picked one up and looked it over. The steel tube was perfectly round, and the surface was smooth without any pores, the inner hole as straight as the outer wall, and when aligned with the sunlight, a straight highlight could be seen. Roland used his fingernail to tap on the ends of the tube and found that the wall thickness was essentially uniform.



Roland couldn't help but admire, "How did you make this?"

"Look." Anna picked up a freshly cut steel rod, laid it flat in her hand, and a black thread was inserted from one end, piercing through the rod until it came out the other end. Then, it circled around the center once, and the hole was made.

An amazing ability, he thought. Using a magic thread of high heat to cut objects while being able to control the precision, Anna could single-handedly push the industrial products of the town to a new height. He suppressed the excitement in his heart and said, "Let's start with some basic tests."

The basic tests included the range of abilities, the strength of abilities, and the duration.

Nightingale also appeared from the Mist, and she was responsible for observing the changes in the magic power within Anna.

The results showed that besides a significant increase in ability strength and duration, the range of the Blackfire remained around five meters, with precise control only possible within three meters.

At the same time, it still belonged to the summoning type of ability; the God's Punishment Stones could dispel the effects of Blackfire, or when Anna commanded Blackfire to enter the range of the God's Punishment Stones, it would also disappear abruptly.

It seems that unless she evolves to use magic power directly, this hurdle cannot be bypassed, Roland thought.

Nevertheless, Anna's new ability still had revolutionary significance. By using Blackfire to make industrial mother machines and then producing various machine tools, the level of mechanical processing was set for a rapid ascent.



However, industrial mass production is never something that can be accomplished by a single person. For instance, the kiln that Karl built on the slopes of Northern Slope Mountain has been completed. Upon commencing operation, it was discovered that while it could fire clay bricks effectively, the temperature was never high enough to produce cement. Consequently, the cement needed by Border Town still depended on Anna's production—fortunately, after reaching adulthood, she could complete the calcination process even without staying in a dust-filled room.



Roland had ways to solve the problem of the kiln not reaching the required temperatures, such as using a steam engine to provide forced air to increase the furnace temperature, and setting up an exhaust gas circulation channel to improve the utilization of dissipated thermal energy. However, the production of the steam engine also relied on Anna, from the casting of critical components to welding, all had to be done by her personally.



It could be said that the current industrial products of Border Town were all built upon Anna's abilities. Once she was gone, the so-called industrial development would be nothing more than a mirage.



During the Evil Months, everything Roland did was for emergency purposes. Now that the threat of demonic beasts no longer existed, and Longsong Stronghold provided a large population and funds, he naturally wanted to change this situation.



—"Start with the most fundamental things."



He asked Anna to cut out a steel strip two fingers wide and about one millimeter thick. Then he picked out a standard centimeter-long iron ruler previously defined, took a small segment of distance as the fixed length for the black line, and arranged it repeatedly until ten black lines were roughly equal to the standard centimeter length. Next, he had the black line climb onto the steel strip, etching out vertical marks one by one. Under the control of the black line, the distance between each vertical mark was almost identical.



Roland planned to start with straight rulers, creating a batch of primitive samples of various measuring tools and at the same time standardizing the units of measurement. These standard units would also be written into guidelines and manuals, to be incorporated into the upcoming universal education initiative.
