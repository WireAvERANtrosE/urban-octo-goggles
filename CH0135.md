## Start from the basics.
"The devils are increasing in number while we are dwindling. The Holy City of Taquila has fallen, and we have fled in all directions. Crossing over mountains and rivers, we run as far as we can from the gates of hell. But where can we escape to next time?"

"What do you think?" In the office, Roland closed the Book of Magic and asked Scroll.

"If that knight did not remember incorrectly, this is indeed a remarkable coincidence," Scroll pondered for a moment. "The contents of the treasure map align with the notes in the ancient books, indirectly proving that the Church once built cities deep in the Barbarian Land to resist the devils. The location marked on the drawings could be their defense towers, outposts, warehouses, or some other facilities."

"You mean...it's not an actual treasure map?"

"Of course not. The Church is neither bandits nor pirates; they have no need to hide their treasure and leave behind a map for others to find."

Roland nodded. "That makes sense. So...this is actually a map?"

"Most likely. Although it's unclear why the Church did not record this period of history, I believe there must be more than one relic buried in the Eastern Region's forest," Scroll analyzed. "If the marked facility was just a surface structure, it would be hard to find anything remaining after a few hundred years. However, if it included an underground chamber or storage cellar, it might well be another underground relic. Through it, we might find some clues."

"What kind of clues?"

"Why did the Church conceal the existence of devils? Why did they resist the devils but kept it a profound secret?" She paused, her voice growing somber, "And...why did they hunt witches as if they were devils?"

Roland didn't know how to comfort her, so after a moment of silence, he slowly began to speak, "It's a pity that we don't know whether his drawing is accurate or not. According to him, the original map was so neatly done that it didn't seem hand-drawn."

"How about sending Nightingale to check out the knight's residence?"

"That wouldn't be appropriate," Roland dismissed the idea, "A family that has managed to keep a treasure map for hundreds of years might have their storage room filled with Divine Stones of Judgement and traps. Let's put this matter aside for now," he gestured with his fingers forming a triangle, "Anyway, we can't reach that place at the moment. If we consider the area at the foot of North Slope Mountain as the mining zone, the location indicated by the hexagram is at least fifty kilometers away from us, roughly the distance from Border Town to Longsong Stronghold. Apart from Lightning, who can reach there within a day, it would take others two to three days on foot. What if they encounter a devil on the way... I don't want any of you to come to harm."

"You could have Lightning scout the forest area from the air first, she might discover something," Scroll suggested.

"That's a feasible plan," Roland stood up, "I'll talk to her when she returns. Right now, I need to go to the North Slope Mine. You prepare the teaching materials needed for the class later. If you need to make multiple copies, find Soraya. I still have to continue teaching them tonight."

Roland combined the elementary education he received when he was young with the court education methods of the Four Princes and imparted them to Scroll, including categorized memorization, phonetic writing, and reciting phrases. With these, he believed she would become a good teacher.

"Yes, Your Highness," Scroll bowed.

The backyard of the smelting area in the North Slope mining zone had more than doubled in size compared to before, and there were still two unfilled holes dug out on the ground. The cores of the twelve-pound cannons were cast here. When Roland arrived at the backyard, Anna was practicing her new ability, and there were two objects that looked like steel pipes on the table.

He picked up one and examined it: the steel pipe was perfectly cylindrical, with a smooth surface free of any pores, and the round hole in the middle shone with a straight highlight when aligned with the sunlight. Roland tested the wall thickness at both ends with his fingernail and found it to be consistently uniform.

Roland was full of admiration. "How did you make this?"

"Look." Anna picked up a freshly cut steel rod, laid it flat in her hand, and a thin black line was inserted from the end until it completely penetrated the rod, then it circled around the center, and the hole was made.

It was an amazing ability, he thought. Using a high-heat magic line to cut objects while controlling the precision, Anna alone could push the industrial products of the town to new heights. He suppressed his excitement and said, "Let's start with some basic tests."

The basic tests included the range of abilities, the strength of the abilities, and the duration.

Nightingale also appeared from the Mist, and she was in charge of observing the changes in the magic power inside Anna.

The results showed that, in addition to a significant increase in the strength and duration of the abilities, the range of the Blackfire remained around five meters, and it could only be precisely controlled within three meters.

Moreover, it was still a summoning ability; the Divine Stone of Judgement could remove the effect of the Blackfire, or when Anna commanded the Blackfire to enter the area affected by the Divine Stone of Judgement, it would also disappear suddenly.

It seems that unless it evolves to the point of being able to use magic power directly, this hurdle cannot be bypassed, Roland thought.

Nevertheless, Anna's new ability still had revolutionary significance. Using Blackfire to make industrial mother machines and then producing various machine tools, the level of mechanical processing was set for a rapid ascent.

However, industrial mass production was never something one person could accomplish. For example, the kiln that Karl built at the edge of North Slope Mountain, one had been completed. Upon putting it to use, it was found to be adequate for firing clay bricks, but the temperature was never high enough for producing cement, meaning that Border Town still had to rely on Anna to manufacture itâ€”fortunately, after reaching adulthood, she was able to complete the calcination process even without staying in a dust-filled room.

Roland was not without solutions to the problem of the furnace's insufficient temperature. For instance, he could pair it with a steam engine to provide blast air to raise the temperature, and set up a waste gas recirculation channel to improve the utilization of the lost heat energy. However, the production of the steam engine itself also depended on Anna, from the casting of critical components to welding, all of which had to be done by her alone.

It could be said that the current industrial products of Border Town were all built on Anna's abilities. Once she was gone, the so-called industrial development would be nothing more than a mirage.

During the Evil Months, everything Roland did was for emergency purposes. Now that the threat of demonic beasts no longer existed, and Longsong Stronghold had provided a large number of people and funds, he naturally wanted to change this situation.

"Start with the most basic," he said.

He had Anna cut out a steel strip two fingers wide, about one millimeter thick, then picked out the standard centimeter ruler they had previously established, taking a short distance as the fixed length for a black line, repeatedly arranging it until ten black lines roughly equaled the standard centimeter length. Then he had the black lines climb onto the steel strip, etching vertical marks with each burn. Under the control of the black lines, the distance between each vertical mark was almost entirely equal.

Roland planned to start with the straight ruler, producing a batch of primitive samples of various measuring tools, while unifying the system of measurements. These standard units would also be written into regulations and manuals, to be included in the upcoming general education program.
