## Market and Clues
Ferlin stood behind his wife, smiling as he watched her carefully select goods from the stall.

Whenever it came to this, Irene's gaze was always extra serious.

"Actually... every piece of meat is priced by weight, it doesn't really matter which one you pick."

"No way!" She rejected decisively, "You like lean meat, right? But without the fatty parts, it won't be fragrant enough when cooked. The best ribs have layers of fat and lean meat, and they are also perfect for pan-frying. I must pick carefully."

Ferlin couldn't help but laugh, "Alright then, you take your time here, I am going to buy a bag of wheat. There's a line over there, and it will take a while. Come find me after you're done."

"Okay," Irene replied without turning her head.

He shook his head helplessly and turned to walk towards the grain stall in the convenience market.

Since the snowfall, the lord had set up windbreak sheds around the market and even posted notices, announcing that the sales would not cease even in winter.

This meant that, throughout the long Evil Months, the town would still provide a stable supply of food.



For the townspeople, this was undoubtedly a strong reassurance. 

Compared to the less frequented meat stalls, the grain vendor had many more customers. A long line formed in front of the counter, and two patrol members in black uniforms were maintaining order. However, in the small town, they had a completely different name: police officers.

The various astounding initiatives of the lord were no longer surprising to the Dawnlight citizens; a name change was hardly unusual. Moreover, he knew that to most commoners, the patrol members gave an impression no different from that of thugs and ruffians, so a change of name would indeed feel distinctive.

"Good afternoon, Mr. Silt," someone recognized him in the line, "You're here to buy wheat too?"

"Come stand here."

"I'll give you my spot."

"No, there's no need," Phyllis waved his hand and stood at the end of the line, "Thank you."

"You're quite popular," the middle-aged man in front of him laughed, "As expected of the once First Knight of the Western Region."

Phyllis was slightly startled, "You know about my past..."



"Haha, of course, it's no secret here in Border Town," the other party said with a grin, stroking his chin, "My son and daughter are both very fond of you. Ever since they found out about your background, my eldest son Nat has been clamoring to become a knight."

"That's all in the past," he shook his head, "And His Highness no longer needs knights."

"We have the First Army," the middle-aged man said nonchalantly, "Before, I wouldn't have dared to speak to you like this."

Indeed, when he was still a Duke's knight, most commoners wouldn't even dare to make eye contact with him. The words whispered behind his back were filled with envy and admiration, but more often than not, they were also filled with fear. The only one who dared to look him in the eyes and speak her mind without concern for status was Irene—it was that first encounter at the theater that made his heart find its home.

After being captured and brought to Border Town, Phyllis originally thought he was merely switching lords to serve, but never expected that he would end up as a teacher imparting knowledge to everyone, and also receiving their respect in turn.

This respect was completely different from what he felt as a knight. People wouldn't avoid or stay away from him; instead, they wanted to get closer to him—compared to the respect that comes with maintaining a distance, the latter made Phyllis feel warmer and more fulfilled.

Perhaps, he was not suited to be a knight after all.

...

After waiting for a while, it was finally Phyllis Silt's turn.



"ID card," the teller said, before pausing, "Mr. Phyllis?"



"Betty," he was also somewhat surprised, the girl behind the counter was the first of his students to graduate. Phyllis quickly realized and joyfully said, "You've joined the City Hall?"



"Yes," she replied with a joyful expression on her face, nodding and bowing just like she did back at the academy, "I'm now an apprentice at the Administrative Office, currently working in the Department of Agriculture."



Not wanting to keep the people behind him waiting, Phyllis handed over his ID card along with six Silver royals, "I'll take a medium bag of wheat."



"Alright!" She registered his name in the ledger, called out to someone, and a porter came out of the warehouse, placing a bag of wheat on the counter. There was no inspection or selection allowed here; each bag was already packed and weighed, divided into large, medium, and small sizes, with the small bag being about enough for two people to eat for a month. The price of grain was fixed, with almost no fluctuation. When purchasing, one must show their ID card, and there were restrictions on the amount one could buy. Phyllis understood that this measure was clearly to prevent people from buying up large amounts of grain, leaving the truly needy civilians without any to buy.



"Teacher, you should come by my place sometime," Betty said as she returned his ID card.



"Mhm." Phyllis smiled in response, hoisted the bag of wheat onto his shoulder, and stepped aside to make room. It was at this moment that he noticed Irene was still nowhere to be seen—she probably got distracted by other goods. He simply found a conspicuous and dry spot, placed the bag on the ground, and sat down to rest for a moment.



Just then, a flash of blue caught his eye.



Dawn Light was startled and turned his head to look, his body shaking—there was a beautiful woman with delicate features and rare blue hair, the kind one would never forget at first sight. Phyllis felt his blood almost freeze; not because of her outstanding appearance, but because... he had seen this noble countenance before in the family hall.



As a child, he had asked more than once who the person in the portrait hanging at the top of the hall's wall was, but his father remained tight-lipped. She was undoubtedly a woman, yet her portrait was placed before all of his ancestors. It was only after his father had had too much to drink that he mentioned her.

If he remembered correctly, the woman in the painting was the founder of the Sylt family.

How could this be?

"Sorry to keep you waiting," Irene's voice pulled him back from his muddled thoughts, "I picked out some more eggs and also bought a small bag of butter. Have you got your wheat?"

"Uh..." Phyllis responded absentmindedly.

Back at home, the image from the painting still lingered before his eyes, the figure of the woman haunting him... Why had he seen the ancestor of the Sylt family in Border Town?

After much hesitation, he decided to take a trip back to Longsong Stronghold.

When Phyllis shared this plan with Irene, she raised an eyebrow, "Haven't you already severed ties with your family? Why go back?"

"Uh... Because," he hesitated, "because of some matters."



"Inheritance rights?" Irene tilted her head. "No, could it be... for a woman?"

"Cough cough," Phyllis turned her head. "How could that be!"

"But your eyes tell me you're lying," she said as she pressed Dawnen onto the chair and looked down at him from above. "You promised to be my knight, and I believe you won't break your promise, which is why I'm especially curious... And why can't you tell me everything? We agreed in front of that farmhouse on the outskirts of Longsong Stronghold that we should hide nothing from each other."

Her eyes were clear and moving, wishing to share everything with her at any time, whether good or bad—despite all the hardships, Irene had never changed.

Phyllis took a deep breath, pulled her into his embrace, and softly repeated his doubts.

"I see," Irene nodded after listening to his story. "Then go."

"You... believe me?" Logically, such a bizarre story was hard to believe even for him—that an ancestor would be alive in the present.

"Of course," she blinked, "this time you didn't stray from my sight."
