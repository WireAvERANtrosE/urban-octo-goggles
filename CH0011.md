## Third Princess
"The sea breeze has turned cold," Grace Wimbledon stroked her wind-tousled hair while gazing at the endless expanse of the ocean, expressing a hint of regret.



"It's because winter is approaching," the handsome man behind her responded, "Even though this is the south, it's still not the extreme south. Only the Sand People don't understand what winter is."



"Our fleet cannot set sail in winter; the ocean currents will make it impossible for them to move an inch. So this should be the last voyage for this season," the woman turned around, "Farrina, how long has the Black Sail been out?"



"Two months and four days," the man replied without hesitation, "If nothing unexpected happens, they should arrive at Clearwater Harbor in three days."



Grace burst into laughter, "I hope they bring me plenty of surprises."



Farrina Coban looked at the assertive woman before him, filled with profound emotion. Her grey hair reflected strands of silver under the autumn sun; her eyes were a light green, and her narrow eye corners gave an indescribable sense of pressure when she fixed her gaze on someone. Having spent a lot of time by the sea, her skin was slightly rough and not as fair as the other royal ladies, but Farrina didn't mind at all. In his eyes, the temperament Grace possessed made any beauty pale in comparison.



Unlike the fools born of inbreeding in Greycastle, the third princess of Wimbledon was a true genius. She had the wisdom and pride of a noble, yet she wasn't bound by convention like them. In this respect, she even resembled a commoner—eager to break the monotony and full of an adventurous spirit.



Of course, no commoner could possess the height and vision she had. Even dukes and princes seemed short-sighted in her presence. The fact that she could invest all of Clearwater Harbor's trade revenue into the construction of the fleet, leaving not a single coin in her treasury, was something those miserly hoarders couldn't match.



"These Gold royals hidden away in a cabinet are meaningless; they're no different from stones when not used. It's only when you spend them that they show their true value. The key is, spending them doesn't mean losing them; if used wisely, the returns you gain can far exceed their value." — Farrina still remembered these words she said to him, almost like an enlightening revelation that broke through the long-standing fixed notions in his mind.



Compared to the royal nobles who counted their savings every day to see how much they had grown, Farrina felt that this was the demeanor of a true ruler.



Thus, she threw in her lot with Grace without hesitation, following her to Clearwater Harbor.



Only after arriving did Farrina realize that the Third Princess's efforts were far from just that—she not only had ideals but also took action. She developed the Black Sail plan centered around this core and carried it out methodically, step by step. Five years ago, the forces trained by Grace had already infiltrated Clearwater Harbor, preparing to form the Black Sail fleet—before Roland Wimbledon III had ever issued the decree for the battle of succession. In other words, she was already ahead of all the other heirs.



"Let's go back inside. The wind is getting stronger," Grace said, turning her head. Her palace was located at the southernmost point of Clearwater Harbor, above Salmon Bay. The tower-like building stood like a sentinel on the coast, with a round terrace at the top that provided an expansive view, overlooking the entire harbor and the merchant ships coming and going.



After five years of management, Clearwater Harbor's trade had begun to take shape. A three-masted ship would be launched from the dockyard every six months, and he had also gained her initial trust. Seizing the moment when the Third Princess seemed in good spirits, Farrina hesitated before asking the biggest question that had been on her mind for the past few months.



"Your Highness, there's something I don't understand." He closed the door, shutting out the howling sea breeze.



"Go ahead," she said with a nod and a smile.



"Why were you able to foresee all this before the King issued the decree for the battle of succession?" He had speculated that perhaps Roland Wimbledon III had told her in advance, but after careful consideration, he knew it was impossible. Everyone knew that the Second Prince was the heir the King valued most, and the decree was set for him, which was evident from the Second Prince's fiefdom, the City of Valencia.



But to guess all this on her own and begin to lay the groundwork five years ago? By the gods, she was only eighteen at the time!



"Prediction?" She showed a funny look, "Do you think I am a witch? I don't possess that kind of ability to act like a god or a ghost."

"Uh, but..."

"I had no idea Father would come up with such a lousy idea as the Battle of Succession to pave the way for his precious second son. In fact, what does the Battle of Succession have to do with what I've been doing?"



No connection? Farrina suddenly seemed to realize something, her mouth agape in surprise.



Seeing the incredulous expression on Farrina Coban's face, Grace laughed, "Do I have to wait for Father to say I can vie for the throne before I have the right to do so? By the same logic, does the person who manages the city best necessarily get to sit on the throne of Greycastle? I thought you would understand when you saw the Black Sail plan."



So that's how it is, Farrina murmured, her fleet wasn't just built for wealth. This fleet belonging to the Third Princess would, after completing its trade, move away from the port to hoist the black sails, robbing merchant ships from other cities or countries. Similarly, the Third Princess encouraged her subjects to sail out to sea to join the Black Sail plan. She promised that any loot would belong to the ship's owner, and Clearwater Harbor would never tax these gains.



This move brought her enormous wealth, which is why this time she simply ordered the Black Sail fleet to head south, to plunder any ships passing through the Endless Cape, as well as the southern Sand People.



And these actions were not just about money. Grace did not use the wealth plundered to build the city or expand overland trade; she just reinvested them into the shipyards, continuing to build more ships.



Over these years, she had gained a large number of experienced sailors, fierce warriors, and the hearts of the people — if she could not continue to govern, all those involved in the plundering would be sent to the gallows.



"The one who manages the city the best will definitely sit on the throne of Greycastle?" No, now Farlyn knew that the one who could sit on the throne was Grace Wimbledon, who owned numerous ships and soldiers, and could sail up the Three Bay River, straight to the city of Valencia.



"Do you know that you would be assigned to Clearwater Port?" 

"It was a surprise, merely an addition to a transaction," Grace shrugged, "I thought it was the church trying to fool me..."



Related to the church? Seeing that the other party did not continue, Farlyn dared not ask more. But he knew that even if Grace had not come to Clearwater Port, this place would still follow her will and continue in the direction she wanted.



"Let's set these aside," she poured herself a cup of tea, "The little trick before seems to have failed."

"Ah, yes," Farlyn quickly gathered his thoughts and replied, "Only Border Town sent news, reporting that the pill was ineffective. There's no news from the other places."



"No news probably means they were dealt with by my brothers, as expected. It was just a pawn I placed casually, it doesn't affect the overall situation, just something to kill time while waiting. However..." She changed her tone, "It's normal for other pawns to fail, but I didn't expect even my fourth brother to come out unscathed. To be honest, I'm a little disappointed."



"The Kingfisher said in the secret letter that the pill was indeed taken, only..."



"Failure is failure, I don't want to hear excuses," Grace interrupted, "Before long it will be the Evil Months, and our dear prince will seek refuge in the Longsong Stronghold, right? When the demonic beasts invade, the stronghold will probably be in chaos for a good while. Write a letter to her, let her seize the opportunity well. I want to see if Lady Luck will still stand on the side of my fourth brother this time?"



"Yes, Your Highness."

"You may leave," Grace waved her hand. Just as Farrain was about to withdraw, the Third Princess called out to him again, "Ah, right. I remember that the pill was bought from the Alchemist, Embis, wasn't it?"

Farrain nodded.

"What did he say at that time? Colorless, tasteless, dissolves in water, deadly if consumed, no antidote, and it was his latest alchemical creation?" Grace yawned, "Hang him."
