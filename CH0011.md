## Third Princess
"The sea breeze has turned cold," Grace Wimbledon remarked as she straightened her wind-blown hair while looking out at the boundless ocean, a hint of regret in her voice.



"It's because winter is approaching," the handsome man behind her replied. "Even though this place is in the south, it's not the extreme south. Only the Sand People fail to understand what winter is."



"Our fleet cannot set sail in winter; the ocean currents would make it impossible for them to move an inch. So this should be the last voyage for this season." The woman turned around, "Farrin, how long has the Black Sail been out?"



"Two months and four days," the man replied without hesitation. "If all goes well, they should arrive at Clearwater Harbor in three days."



Grace laughed heartily. "I hope they bring me enough surprises."



Farrin Coban looked at the woman before him, filled with admiration. Her grey hair reflected streaks of silver in the autumn sun; her light green eyes were narrow at the corners, exerting an inexplicable pressure when she fixed her gaze on someone. Having spent much time by the sea, her skin was slightly roughened, lacking the paleness of other royal women, but Farrin did not mind in the least. In his eyes, the aura that Grace possessed made every other beauty pale in comparison.



Unlike the fools from Greycastle who were products of inbreeding, the third princess of Wimbledon was a true genius. She had the intelligence and pride of nobility, yet she was not bound by convention like other nobles. In this regard, she was even a bit like a commoner—filled with anticipation for breaking the mundane and possessing a spirit of adventure.



Of course, no commoner could have the stature and perspective that she did. Even dukes and princes seemed myopic in her presence. To invest all the trade income from Clearwater Harbor into the construction of the fleet, leaving not a single coin in her own treasury, was something those miserly nobles could never comprehend.



"These Gold royals serve no purpose sitting in a cupboard; they're no different from rocks when not used. It's only when you spend them that they show their value. The key is, spending them doesn't mean losing them. If used wisely, the returns can far exceed their own value."—Farrin still vividly remembered these words she said to him, which had shattered the long-standing preconceptions in his mind.



Compared to those royal nobles who counted their savings day in and day out to see how much they had grown, Farrin thought this was the true demeanor of a ruler.



So he devoted himself to Grace's cause without hesitation, following her to Clearwater Harbor.



It was only after arriving that Farrin realized that the third princess had done far more than that—she not only had the vision but also took action. She had formulated the Black Sail Project around this core and executed it step by step in an orderly fashion. Five years earlier, the forces nurtured by Grace had already infiltrated Clearwater Harbor, preparing to establish the Black Sail Fleet—and at that time, the issuance of the Royal Decree of Succession by Wimbledon III had not yet even been proposed. In other words, she had already been ahead of all the other heirs.



"Let's go back inside; the wind is getting stronger," Grace said, turning her head. Her royal residence was located at the southernmost tip of Clearwater Harbor, above Salmon Bay. This tower-like building stood as a sentinel by the coast, with a circular terrace at its peak, offering an expansive view of the entire harbor and the merchant ships coming and going.



Now, after five years of management, the trade at Clearwater Harbor had taken shape, with a three-masted sailboat being launched from the dockyard every six months, and he had also gained her initial trust. Seizing the moment when the third princess seemed in good spirits, Farrin hesitantly voiced the biggest question that had been on his mind for months.



"Your Highness, there's something I don't understand," he said as he closed the door, shutting out the howling sea wind.



"Speak," she said with an encouraging smile.



"Why could you foresee all this before the King issued the Battle of Succession decree?" He had speculated whether King Wimbledon III had informed her in advance, but upon careful consideration, he knew it was impossible. Everyone knew that the Second Prince was the heir the King valued the most; the Battle of Succession was designed for him, which was evident from the Second Prince's fief, the City of Goldstream.



But to guess all this by herself and start planning five years ago? Good heavens, she was only eighteen at the time!



"Foresee?" She revealed a mocking smile. "Do you take me for a witch? I don't possess such trickery or divine powers."



"Uh, but..."



"I didn't know that my father would come up with such a lousy idea as the Battle of Succession to pave the way for his precious second son. In fact, what does the existence or non-existence of the Battle of Succession have to do with my actions?"



Not related? Farlyn suddenly seemed to realize something, his mouth agape with astonishment.



Seeing the incredulous expression on Farlyn Coben's face, Grace laughed, "Do I need to wait for my father to say that I can compete for the throne before I am qualified to fight for it? Similarly, is it certain that the one who governs a city the best will definitely sit on the Greycastle throne? I thought you would understand when you saw the Black Sail Fleet plan."



So that was it, Farlyn murmured to himself. Her fleet was not merely assembled for wealth. This fleet belonging to the Third Princess, after completing its trade runs, would change to black sails away from the port and rob merchant ships from other cities or countries. Similarly, the Third Princess encouraged her subjects to sail out and partake in the Black Sail Fleet plan. She promised that any loot would belong to the ship's owner, and Clearwater Harbor would never tax profits from such gains.



This move brought her immense wealth, and so this time she simply ordered the Black Sail Fleet to head south directly, to plunder any ships passing by the Endless Cape and the southern Sand People.



These actions were not just about money. Grace did not use the looted wealth to build the city or expand land trade; she reinvested it into the shipyard, continuing to build more and larger ships.



Over these years, she had gained a large number of experienced sailors, fierce warriors, and the support of the masses—if she could not continue to govern, all the participating rogues would be sent to the gallows.



"The one who governs the city the best will definitely sit on the Greycastle throne?" No, Farlyn now understood that the one who could sit on the throne was Grace Wimbledon, who had many ships and soldiers at her command, capable of sailing up the Three Bays River and reaching the City of Goldstream.



"Do you know that you would be assigned to Clearwater Harbor?"



"That was unexpected, just an extra in a deal," Grace shrugged. "I thought it was the Church trying to fool me..."



Related to the Church? Seeing that she did not continue, Farlyn did not dare to ask further. But he knew that even if Grace had not come to Clearwater Harbor, this place would still follow her will and continue in the direction she desired.



"Let's put these matters aside," she said as she poured herself a cup of red tea, "It seems the little trick earlier has failed."



"Ah, yes," Phyllis quickly gathered her thoughts and replied, "Only Border Town has sent news, reporting that the pill was ineffective. There's no word from the other places."

"No news probably means they were taken care of by my brothers, as expected. They were just pawns I set up casually, irrelevant to the overall situation, merely to kill time while waiting. However…" Her tone shifted, "It's normal for the other pawns to fail, but I didn't expect that even my fourth brother would emerge unscathed. To be honest, I'm a little disappointed."

"The Kingfisher mentioned in the secret letter that the pill was indeed ingested, it's just that…"

"Failure is failure, I don't want to hear excuses," Grace interrupted, "The Months of Demons will be upon us soon, and our dear prince will seek refuge at the Longsong Stronghold, won't he? When the demonic beasts invade, the stronghold will likely be thrown into chaos for a good while. Write to her, tell her to seize the opportunity well. I want to see if Lady Luck will still stand by my fourth brother's side this time?"

"Yes, Your Highness."

"You may leave," Grace waved her hand dismissively. Just as Phyllis was about to take his leave, the Third Princess called out to him again, "Ah, that's right. I remember we got that pill from the Alchemist Envoy, right?"

Phyllis nodded.

"What did he say about it at the time? Colorless, tasteless, dissolves like water, certain death upon ingestion, no antidote, and it was his latest alchemical creation?" Grace yawned, "Have him hanged."
