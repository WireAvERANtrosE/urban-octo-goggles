## New Trading Group
By the time summer arrived, Margaret's river fleet had reached Border Town. Roland specially greeted the female merchant at the dock and took the opportunity to inspect the goods she brought with her.



Most importantly, there were three boatloads of saltpeter. By now, Border Town's gunpowder supply was nearly exhausted, and even the First Army's shooting practice had been halted. Though the revolving rifles had begun to be equipped to the troops on a small scale, the training was limited to practicing reloading, firearm maintenance, and reassembling ammunition. With this batch of saltpeter, they could finally resume live-fire training.



In addition to saltpeter, she also brought two boatloads of ore ingots in accordance with their agreement, mainly iron and copper, as well as some green vitriol ore. It would take two to three days just to unload these goods.



Roland had also placed two steam engines in a prominent position in the storage yard, and as was customary, covered them with red silk and tied on big red bows for Margaret to inspect. In fact, the Western Region Industrial Company had struggled for nearly a month to assemble a single steam engine, and that was based on hundreds of scrapped parts. Therefore, Roland had no choice but to have Anna rework those defective parts with not too significant deviations, allowing the second steam engine to be completed in time for the scheduled delivery.



What surprised Roland was that Margaret did not come alone this time; she also brought a group of merchants from the capital.



After the goods were delivered, Margaret and her entourage followed Roland back to the castle, where they enjoyed a lavish lunch in the reception hall.



"Your Highness, this is Hogg, an old friend of mine and one of the top mining merchants in the capital," Margaret introduced them one by one. "This is Gamor, who, like Marl, belongs to the Crescent Moon Bay trading caravan, specializing in transoceanic trade between Greycastle and the Fjords. They are all very interested in the steam engine. I have known them for many years and would feel embarrassed to sell to them at a higher price, so I brought them to introduce to you."



"Greetings to you, Your Highness," Hogg said, his belly protruding and his face shiny with grease, "Margaret tells me this machine can replace manual labor, quickly pumping water and moving ore out of mines, and it's also incredibly powerful, never needing to rest all day? May I see it with my own eyes?"



"Of course," Roland sipped his wine. At first, he couldn't get used to the tart taste, but now he had grown somewhat accustomed to it, "but to have it transport ore, we'll also need to install a track system. After lunch, I can take you to the Northern Slope Mine to see for yourself."



"Your Highness, I am very curious about the uses of the steam engine you described. Can it really be installed on a sailboat to replace the sails and propel the boat forward?" Marland spoke, "What about the bigger ships, the kind with three to four masts? I'm afraid it might not have sufficient power."



"Steam engines are like horses; some are stronger, and some weaker, depending on the model made. Of course, the more powerful machines naturally cost more. And if one isn't enough, you can always install two, or even four," Roland replied with a smile.



Putting a steam engine on a ship, even the most primitive paddle steamer, involves a complex system of power, transmission, and control. Except for Border Town, no other place in Greycastle possesses the technical capability for such modifications. And refitting a ship like that would inevitably cost far more than the steam engine itself.



"In that case, the Crescent Moon Bay trading fleet would also like to order such machines from you," Gamor picked up a freshly steamed bun and shoved it in his mouth, squinting from the hot, rich juice of the meat.



Birds of a feather flock together; the friends of a dog merchant are still dog merchants, placing orders without even looking at the actual effects, as if they don't care about spending thousands of Gold Royals.



Roland shook his head, "Unfortunately, Border Town is short-staffed, and the manufacturing of steam engines is quite complex. Before completing the order for Margie, it would be difficult to produce any extra machines."



"I can provide you with manpower, Your Highness," Gamor patted his chest, "be it carpenters or blacksmiths, or even shipbuilders, I have many at my port, and you wouldn't even need to pay them!"



"And then have them learn the manufacturing methods to use for yourself?" Hogg interjected.



"No! Of course not!" He widened his eyes, "How could I dare to play such tricks in front of His Highness the Prince. Ten years, Your Highness," he spread his hands, "I am willing to have them work for you for ten years, and I will pay their salaries. There is only one request, and that is that the steam engines they produce are to be sold to the Crescent Moon Bay caravan first."



This is an interesting proposal, Roland thought, similar to a technical partnership in later eras where he would only provide the technology and earn the lion's shareâ€”of course, the other party could also get the steam engines sooner, and after ten years, they would have a group of skilled workers, with the workers' salaries over these ten years essentially acting as the fee for the technology purchase.



"There's no need to rush to a decision, we can discuss these details after seeing the actual products," Roland gestured with his hand, "Moreover, it's not just the steam engines here that are worth buying. There are other things that I'm sure you would be interested in, such as this." He snapped his fingers, and the guard beside him took out a pile of items from a wooden box at his feet and laid them out on the table one by one.



"These are all new products from Border Town, each of high quality and fairly priced, like this simplest mug," Roland pointed to the colorful cup on the table, "Light, beautiful, and not as fragile as crystal glasses. The patterns on them can be customized, and they are water-resistant, making them extremely easy to clean."



"Water-resistant?" Margaret picked up a cup and examined it closely.



"You could try it with wine," the prince joked, "After drinking, you can pretend to be drunk and throw it on the ground. If it breaks, it's on me."



"This workmanship, tsk tsk, is indeed exquisite... I'm afraid not every cup can guarantee this quality, right?" The portly Hogg had already filled himself with wine, drinking it in one gulp, "Eh, it's actually dry inside."



Of course, it's dry; it is essentially a normal wooden cup, but it's covered with a layer of Soraya's painting, and the patterns are all designed by himself. "It doesn't conflict with crystal glasses; it's more suited to appear in the boudoirs of those young ladies than at a formal court banquet," Roland said, "As far as I know, they have never been able to resist things that are brightly colored and beautiful in shape."



"I think so too," Margaret nodded with interest, "It seems you truly have a wealth of experience."



"Cough cough," the prince coughed twice, "Take a look at this, a full-body breastplate with completely even thickness, made up of two pieces, front and back, both forged from wrought iron. Not only is it lighter than a knight's plate armor, but it can also be worn by a single person. When closed, it leaves no gaps, making it suitable for the guards of merchant caravans without attendants. Most importantly, it's cheaper than plate armor..."

...

After introducing all the products, the merchants couldn't help but whisper among themselves. Roland simply gave them some time to discuss freely and stood up to leave the hall, heading to the courtyard gallery to get some fresh air.

"Your Highness, I haven't seen you in a month, and there are many new things here," Margaret also followed him out.

"Don't you need to exchange opinions with them?"

"No, I don't need to listen to others' opinions when it comes to things I'm interested in, whether it's goods or people," she said, shaking her head with a smile. "The caravan will probably stay here for three or four days, could you... let me see Lightning again?"

"Although she didn't recognize you, there was at least no sign of dislike last time, so I don't think there's a problem."

"Thank you!" Margaret said gratefully.

"It's nothing," Roland smiled. "By the way, since you're staying for so long, why not come watch a play? Border Town will have its first theater performance in three days."



"In one month, you've built the theater?" she exclaimed in surprise. 

"Of course not. This is an open-air performance, right in the central square of the town. I believe it will certainly be unique." 

"Then I shall obey with respect, Your Highness," said Margaret, placing her hand on her chest and bowing.
