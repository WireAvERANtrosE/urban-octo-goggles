## New Trading Group
By the time summer arrived, Margaret's river fleet had reached Border Town. Roland specially went to the docks to receive the lady merchant and to inspect the goods she brought with her.



The most important were the three full ships of saltpeter. Border Town's supply of gunpowder had nearly run out, and even the First Army's shooting practice had stopped. Although the revolving rifles had started to be equipped to the troops on a small scale, it was only limited to practicing loading and unloading, firearm maintenance, and ammunition reloading. Now, with this batch of saltpeter, they could finally resume live-fire training.



In addition to saltpeter, she also brought two ships of metal ingots as per the agreement—mainly iron and copper, as well as some green vitriol ore. Unloading these goods alone would take two to three days.



Roland had also placed two steam engines in a prominent position in the yard, and as per tradition, draped them with red silk and tied large red bows for Margaret's inspection. In fact, the Western Region Industrial Company had struggled for nearly a month to assemble one steam engine, and this was based on hundreds of scrapped parts, so Roland had to ask Anna to rework those defective parts that were not too far off, allowing the second steam engine to be ready in time for the scheduled delivery.



What surprised Roland was that Margaret did not come alone this time; she also brought a group of businessmen from the royal capital.



After the goods were delivered, Margaret and her group followed Roland back to the castle, where they enjoyed a sumptuous lunch in the parlor.



"Your Highness, this is Hogg, an old friend of mine and one of the leading mining businessmen in the royal capital," Margaret introduced them one by one. "This is Gammon, belonging to the Crescent Moon Bay caravan like Malan, mainly engaged in transoceanic trade between Greycastle and the Fjords. They are very interested in steam engines. I have known them for many years and did not feel right to mark up the price when selling to them, so I brought them to introduce to you."



"Greetings to you, respected Your Highness," said Hogg, with his round belly and shiny, oily face, "Margaret told me that this machine can replace manpower, quickly pumping water and hauling ore from the mines, and also has immense strength that does not require rest all day long? May I have the honor to see it with my own eyes?"



"Of course," Roland sipped his grape wine, initially unable to adapt to its sour taste, but now he was gradually getting used to it, "However, in order to use it to transport ore, we must also install a matching rail system. After lunch, I can take you to the North Slope Mine to see for yourselves."



"Your Highness, I am very curious about the uses of the steam engine that you described. Can it really be installed on a sailboat to replace the sails and drive the ship forward?" Marlan asked, "What about large ships with three or four masts? I'm afraid it might not be powerful enough."



"Steam engines, like horses, vary in strength. That depends on the model made during manufacturing. Of course, the more powerful the engine, the more expensive it will naturally be. And if one isn't enough, we can always install two or four," Roland replied with a smile.



Integrating a steam engine onto a ship, even the most primitive paddle steamer, involves a complex system of power, transmission, and control. Aside from Border Town, no other place in Greycastle possesses the technical capability to retrofit such technology. And the cost of transforming such a ship will inevitably far exceed the cost of the steam engine itself.



"If that's the case, the Crescent Moon Bay Trading Group would also like to order such machines from you," Gamor picked up a freshly steamed bun and stuffed it into his mouth, squinting from the hot, rich juice of the meat.



Birds of a feather flock together; the friends of a big shot are also big shots themselves, placing orders directly without even looking at the actual effects, as if a thousand Gold royals mean nothing to them.



Roland shook his head, "Unfortunately, Border Town is short-handed, and the manufacturing of steam engines is very complex. Before completing Margie's order, it's unlikely that we can produce any extra machines."



"I can provide you with manpower, esteemed Your Highness," Gamor patted his chest, "Whether carpenters or blacksmiths, even shipbuilders, my port has plenty of them, and you wouldn't even need to pay for their labor!"



"And then have them learn the manufacturing methods for your own use?" Hogg interjected.



"No! Of course not!" He exclaimed with wide eyes, "How dare I play such tricks in front of His Highness the Prince. Ten years, Your Highness," he spread his two hands, "I am willing to have them work for you for ten years, and I will pay their salaries. There is only one requirement, which is that the steam engines produced by them be sold to the Crescent Moon Bay caravan first."



This was an interesting proposal, Roland thought, similar to a technology partnership in later generations. He would only provide the technology and earn the lion's share—of course, the other party could also get the steam engines quickly, and after ten years, they would have a group of skilled workers. The wages of these workers for ten years were essentially the purchase cost of the technology.



"There's no need to rush to a decision, we can discuss these details slowly after seeing the actual products," Roland gestured with his hand downwards, "And it's not just steam engines that are worth buying here. There are other things that I'm sure you will be interested in as well, like this." He snapped his fingers, and the guard beside him moved a large pile of items from a wooden box at their feet, placing them one by one on the table.



"These are all new products from Border Town, each of high quality and reasonably priced, like this simplest mug," Roland pointed to the colorful cup on the table, "Lightweight, beautiful, and not as fragile as crystal glasses. The pattern on it can be customized, and it's water-resistant, very easy to clean."



"Water-resistant?" Margaret picked up a cup and examined it closely.



"You could try it with wine," the Prince joked, "After drinking, you can even pretend to be drunk and throw it on the ground. If it breaks, it's on me."



"This craftsmanship, tsk tsk, is indeed extremely fine... I'm afraid not every cup can guarantee this quality, right?" The portly Hogg had already filled his cup with wine and took a gulp, "Eh, it's actually dry inside."



Of course, it's dry; it is essentially an ordinary wooden cup, but it was covered with a layer of Soraya's paintings, and the designs were all his own. "It doesn't conflict with crystal glasses. It's more suitable for the boudoirs of those young ladies than for formal court banquets," Roland said, "As far as I know, they have always been unable to resist things that are colorful and beautifully shaped."



"I think so too," Margaret nodded with interest, "You do seem to have a wealth of experience."



"Cough cough," the prince coughed twice, "Take a look at this, the full body armor with completely uniform thickness, consisting of two pieces, front and back, both forged from wrought iron. Not only is it lighter than a knight's plate armor, but it can also be worn by a single person. When closed, it leaves no gaps, making it suitable for the guards of merchant caravans without retainers. Most importantly, it's cheaper than plate armor..."

...

After introducing all the products, the merchants couldn't help but whisper to each other. Roland simply gave them some time to discuss freely, stood up, and left the hall to take a stroll in the garden gallery.



"Your Highness, it's been a month, and you have even more novelties here," said Margaret as she also walked out.



"Don't you need to exchange opinions with them?"



"No, the things I am interested in don't require the opinions of others, be it goods or people," she replied with a laugh, shaking her head, "The caravan will probably stay here for three or four days. Could you... let me see Lightning again?"



"Although she didn't recognize you, she didn't show any sign of dislike last time, so I don't see a problem."



"Thank you so much!" Margaret said gratefully.



"It's nothing," Roland smiled, "By the way, since you're staying for so long, why not come and watch a play? Border Town will hold its first theatrical performance in three days."



"In one month, you've built a theater?" she exclaimed in surprise.

"Of course not. This is an open-air performance, right in the town center square. I believe it will definitely be unique."

"Then I shall respectfully comply, Your Highness," Margaret said, placing her hand on her chest and bowing her head.
