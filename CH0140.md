## Seed
Not long after the assistant minister left, the prince received some long-awaited good news.
Shawn, his personal guard who went to Clearwater Harbor to purchase crop seeds, had returned.
When Roland followed the guard who brought the news to the garden, he saw Shawn and a few other personal guards unloading bags of packages from their mounts.
It had been almost a month since the day of departure, and he looked tanned and a bit thinner.
Upon seeing the prince, Shawn immediately stood up straight and saluted. Roland quickly approached, patting his shoulder, "Well done. What kinds of seeds have you brought back?"
Shawn crouched down and untied one of the packages on the ground, "Pearl rice, earth eggs, sugar rods... I managed to buy all the plants you described at Clearwater Harbor. Indeed, most of them originate from the Fjords islands, but there are already quite a few farms in Clearwater Harbor cultivating these crops."
"Did you ask the merchants how to grow them?"
"I did, but they couldn't give me specific methods, and they also said that these plants are difficult to grow in other places once they leave the southern regions." Shawn grabbed a handful of yellow-orange kernels from the package and spread them out in front of Roland, "Your Highness, this is the pearl rice. The merchant said that if I bought it together with the pearl rods, it would be cheaper. However, the pearl rods are too heavy to carry, so I only bought one complete rod back, and the rest are these shelled seeds."
Without a doubt, pearl rice was the corn he was familiar with. He excitedly picked up a corn kernel and examined it in the sunlight. The fruit looked somewhat shriveled, suggesting it was winter stock. Corn naturally has a higher yield than wheat and has lower soil requirements. With the transformation by Leaf, it might soon replace wheat as the main food source in Border Town.

Shawn opened another bundle and brought out a round, brown-skinned crop. "This is a 'ground egg,' I had it at an inn in Clearwater Harbor; sliced into strips and soaked in a basin of water, it's very crisp and has a faintly sweet taste."

Recognizing the familiar shape, Roland was filled with emotion. It was clearly a potato! He used his finger to scrape off the mud-caked skin, revealing the deep yellow flesh inside—compared to later times, the potatoes were small, the tuber color was darker, and not every piece was shaped like an egg. He noticed that the bag also contained some potatoes that were long and shaped like carrots.

"This tastes even better mashed and steamed into a paste."

"Eh... Your Highness, you've had it before?"

"Uh-huh, I've had it at a royal banquet," Roland decided to tell a lie, because the name 'ground egg' was just too unappetizing, "The royal chefs don't call it a 'ground egg,' but a potato. The delicious dish made from it is called mashed potatoes."

"I see, it's no wonder you're so knowledgeable, Your Highness," Shawn exclaimed. He then opened the last package, which was bulging tightly, and pulled out a black-skinned stick. "Your Highness, I think this crop is the most important. Honey is very cheap in Clearwater Harbor, largely because of it. I heard in the tavern that more and more farmlands are starting to switch to growing sugar rods. The stalks of this miraculous plant are actually sweet; after peeling, the juice can be extracted, and it costs a tenth of the price of honey, yet it tastes just as sweet as honey water."

Roland wanted to say he had seen this crop before and casually rename it to sugarcane, but he thought better of it. It wouldn't be too late to correct the name when the citizens started planting it. Sugarcane is the raw material for making cane sugar, and if planted extensively, it can also be used for ethanol extraction, making it a crop that can greatly increase the happiness of the residents. Just imagine, a flatbread made of flour is bland, but if sprinkled with some sugar, the taste can be elevated several levels, even someone like Roland, who prefers savory foods, would be captivated.

"Are there any other crop seeds?"

"That's all from Clearwater Harbor," he said, taking out five or six small pouches from his inner pocket and handing them to His Highness, "You ordered me to bring back seeds of plants that are in Greycastle but not in the small towns. These packets were selected as I passed through Willow Town and Longsong Stronghold, including grape, soybean, cotton, flax, and olive tree seeds. However, the farmers said that grapes are mostly planted by inserting cuttings into the ground; seeds can also be planted, but they germinate very slowly, and the grapes that grow are not very tasty."

With Leaf, these issues are not a problem, Roland thought. Now that they had grape seeds, perhaps it was time to try cultivating a grapevine variety of wheat. As for soybeans, cotton, flax, and olives, they were all very useful crops. First, they would have Leaf breed seeds suitable for the climate and soil of the Western Region, then have the serfs plant them on a small scale, and finally, the Ministry of Agriculture would be responsible for summarizing improvements and compiling a planting manual.

"Your Highness, I have some information to report to you," Shawn whispered, "about the situation at Clearwater Port."

"Does it involve the Third Princess?"

Shawn nodded, "I spent nearly two weeks at Clearwater Port. Apart from purchasing seeds, I mostly stayed in the tavern. There are rumors that your sister, Princess Grace Wimbledon, has reached an agreement with the Sand People. She has offered them the land at the edge of the Southern Territory to reside in, and in return, the Sand People have pledged allegiance to her, obeying her summons and assignments. During my time at the port, I indeed saw a considerable number of Mojin people on the streets."

The Mojin from the far south... Although Border Town did not discriminate based on origin, it was another matter to bring a large number of different races to settle in the kingdom's territory. It seemed that Grace was truly unscrupulous in her quest for the throne, Roland thought. "The Sand People consist of many different factions; it's unlikely they would all follow her command. Do you know which clans she has managed to persuade?"

Shawn shook his head, "The Sand People are very wary of the people from Greycastle, and even with Gold royals, I couldn't buy more detailed information. However...something very strange happened. I was planning to leave Clearwater Port the day before Grace returned victoriously from Eagle City, and the city was celebrating their queen's defeat of the usurper king, Timothy. But the next day, there were four or five murder cases in the city, with one victim even being torn into pieces on the street."

"After that, Clearwater Port was put under martial law, and I had to stay there for three more days. The taverns were closed, so everyone gathered in the inn's hall to talk about it. Some said it was revenge from the usurper king, others said it was the work of the Sand People. One merchant from the Fjords claimed he had witnessed one of the murders. The assailant wasn't very tall, clearly not one of the Sand People, but his strength and speed were beyond what any normal human could possess. The arriving patrol team was slaughtered without leaving a single survivor, and even though he was stabbed several times and bleeding profusely, he seemed utterly indifferent. It wasn't until more patrol members arrived with shields and spears that they managed to kill him. After the martial law was lifted, I didn't dare to stay any longer and immediately took a merchant ship back."

"You did well," Roland pondered for a moment, "You don't need to return the remaining Gold royals from the seed purchase to the city hall. Consider it your reward."

"Thank you for your grace, Your Highness!"

"The strength and speed far exceed that of a normal person, and they ignore the pain brought by knife wounds. It sounds like... the Church's pills," Nightingale's voice echoed in his ear after the guard left.

"I think so too. But this makes it even more incomprehensible," Roland frowned, "According to Shawn, Grace would have gotten the pills even earlier than me, while supporting both sides in the struggle for the throne... What exactly are they thinking?" A bad feeling faintly emerged in his heart—could it be that the true intention of the Church was not to see a stable Greycastle?
