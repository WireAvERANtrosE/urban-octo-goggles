## Seed
Not long after the assistant minister left, the prince received a piece of long-awaited good news.

His personal guard, Shawn, who had gone to Clearwater Port to purchase crop seeds, had returned.

When Roland followed the guard who brought the news to the garden, he saw Shawn and a few other personal guards unloading bags of parcels from their mounts.

It had been almost a month since the day he left, and he looked quite tanned and a bit thinner.

Upon seeing the prince, Shawn immediately stood upright and saluted. Roland quickly stepped forward and patted his shoulder, "Well done. What kind of seeds have you brought back?"

Shawn crouched down, untying the package on the ground, "Pearl Rice, ground eggs, sugar rods... I've managed to buy all the plants you described at Clearwater Port. Indeed, most of them originate from the Fjords, but there are already quite a few farms in Clearwater Port cultivating these crops."

"Did you ask the merchants how to plant them?"

"I did, but they couldn't give a specific method, and they also said that these plants would hardly grow in places other than the Southern Territory." Shawn pulled out a handful of yellow-orange kernels from the package and spread them in front of Roland, "Your Highness, this is Pearl Rice. The merchant said if I bought it together with the pearl rods, I could get it at a cheaper price. However, the pearl rods are too heavy to carry, so I only bought one complete rod back, and the rest are shelled seeds."

Without a doubt, Pearl Rice was the corn he was familiar with. He excitedly picked up a kernel of corn and examined it under the sunlight. The fruit was somewhat shriveled, seemingly a winter's storage of stock. Corn naturally yields much more than wheat and has lower soil requirements; with the transformation of its leaves, it might soon replace wheat as the main staple food of Border Town.



Shawn unwrapped another parcel and took out a round, brown-skinned crop. "This is a ground egg. I've eaten it at an inn in Clearwater Harbor. When sliced and soaked in water, it's crunchy and has a faint sweet taste."



Seeing this familiar shape, Roland was filled with emotion. This was clearly a potato! He dug out the dirt-covered skin with his finger, revealing the yellowish flesh inside—compared to those of later ages, the potatoes were small, the tubers were darker, and not every one of them was egg-shaped. He noticed that there were also some potatoes in the sack that were long and shaped like carrots.



"This is even tastier when it's mashed and steamed into a puree."



"Uh... Your Highness, you've eaten this before?"



"Yes, I have had it at a royal banquet," Roland decided to tell a little lie, because the name 'ground egg' was truly unpleasant to hear, "The royal chefs didn't call it ground egg but referred to it as a potato. The delicious dish made from it is called mashed potatoes."



"I see, Your Highness is truly knowledgeable." Shawn exclaimed as he opened the last straightened parcel, pulling out a black-skinned stick. "Your Highness, I think this crop is the most important. Honey is very cheap in Clearwater Harbor, largely because of it. According to what I heard in the tavern, more and more farms are starting to switch to growing sugarcane. This miraculous plant's stalk is actually sweet, and after peeling off the skin, the juice can be extracted to make sugar, at one-tenth the price of honey, yet it tastes just as sweet."



Roland really wanted to say that he had also seen this crop and casually rename it to sugarcane, but he thought better of it. It wouldn't be too late to correct it when the people started planting it. Sugarcane, the raw material for making sugar, was a crop that could greatly increase the happiness of the residents. Just think about it—the tasteless flatbread made from flour, but if sprinkled with some sugar, the taste would be elevated several levels, even a salty-food lover like Roland would be impressed.



"Are there any other crop seeds?"



"That's all from Clearwater Harbor," he said, taking five or six small leather pouches from his pocket and handing them to His Highness, "You instructed me to bring back seeds of plants that are in Greycastle but not in the towns. These packets were selected when I passed by Willow Town and Dragon Cliffs City, including seeds of grapes, soybeans, cotton, flax, and olive trees. However, the farmers said that most grapes are planted by inserting cuttings into the ground. Although seeds can also be planted, they germinate very slowly and the grapes produced are not very tasty."



With Leaf present, none of these are a problem, Roland thought. Now that they had grape seeds, perhaps it was time to try out the grapevine version of wheat. As for soybeans, cotton, flax, and olives, they were all very useful crops. First, he would have Leaf breed seeds suitable for the Western Region's climate and soil, then have the serfs plant them on a small scale, and finally, the Ministry of Agriculture would be responsible for summarizing improvements and compiling a planting manual.



"Your Highness, I have some news to report to you," Shawn whispered, "about the situation in Clearwater Harbor."



"Does it involve the third princess?"



Shawn nodded, "I stayed in Clearwater Harbor for nearly two weeks. Apart from purchasing seeds, I spent most of my time in taverns. There are rumors that your sister, Princess Garcia Wimbledon, has reached an agreement with the Sand People. She has offered them the land at the edge of the Southern Territory to reside in, and in return, the Sand People have pledged to recognize her as their queen and follow her summons and dispatches. During my time at the harbor, I indeed saw quite a few of the Mojin people on the streets."



The Mojin people from the extreme south... While Border Town did not discriminate based on origin, settling a large number of different ethnic groups within the kingdom's territory was another matter entirely. It seemed Grace would stop at nothing in her struggle for the throne, Roland thought. "The Sand People are divided into many factions; it's unlikely they all follow her orders. Do you know which clans she has managed to win over?"



Shawn shook his head, "The Sand People are very wary of the people from Greycastle. Even with gold royals, I couldn't buy more detailed information. However... there's something very strange. I was originally planning to leave Clearwater Harbor the day before Princess Garcia returned victoriously from Eagle City, and the city was celebrating their queen's defeat of the false king, Timothy. But the next day, there were four or five murder cases in the city, with one victim torn to pieces on the street."



"After that, Clearwater Harbor went into lockdown, and I had to stay there for an additional three days. With the taverns closed, everyone gathered in the inn's hall to talk about these events. Some said it was the false king's revenge, others said the Sand People did it. One of the Fjords merchants said he witnessed one of the murders; the perpetrator was not tall, clearly not one of the Sand People, but his strength and speed were beyond what any normal person could possess. The arriving patrol was slaughtered to the last man, and he seemed unfazed even with multiple stab wounds and blood everywhere. It wasn't until more patrol members arrived with shields and spears that they managed to kill him. After the lockdown was lifted, I didn't dare to stay any longer and immediately took a merchant ship back."



"You did well," Roland pondered for a moment. "The gold royals left over from the purchase of seeds need not be returned to the City Hall. Consider it your reward."



"Thank you for the reward, Your Highness!"



"Strength and speed far beyond that of a normal person, and indifferent to the pain of knife wounds—it sounds like... the Church's God's Punishment Pills." After the guards had left, Nightingale's voice rang out beside his ear.



"I think so too. But this makes it even more puzzling," Roland frowned, "According to Shawn's statement, Grace received the pills even earlier than I did, and yet they support both sides in the struggle for the throne... What exactly are they thinking?" A bad feeling began to form in his mind—could it be that the Church's real intention is not to see a stable Graycastle?
