## The Last Enemy
Timothy Wimbledon walked into the arched dome at the top of the lord's tower in Clearwater Harbor.



Unlike common castles, this tower building was taller and narrower. Apart from handling official affairs and sightseeing, it was probably not even possible to convene ministers for a court session.



The furnishings inside the room had not been moved at all, as if the owner had just left and would return soon. Directly facing the entrance was a reddish-brown square table, with books neatly arranged on it. In the center, there were several unfinished manuscripts, and a quill pen was stuck in the ink bottle, ready to continue writing.



He walked step by step to the desk and sat down on the large chair. The chair was covered with a cushion made of bamboo strips, which was quite suitable for alleviating the heat of summer. There was also a large bucket of water placed next to the chair, clearly for holding ice wands to cool down and dispel the heat. However, the weather today was a bit gloomy, with dark clouds pressing low over the sea, and the room didn't feel stuffy.



Timothy leaned down and gently sniffed the table, a faint fragrance entered his nostrils—this was Grace's favorite scent of azure kudzu, produced from Coldwind Ridge. Compared to roses and rosemary, it contained a unique sense of coolness, as if it had the ice and snow of the northern lands melted into it.



Only by using an item for a long time could it take on one's own scent, and without a doubt, his sister must have always been sitting in this chair just like him, with her hands on the table, either listening to reports from her subordinates or drafting decrees.



Thinking of this, he couldn't help but let out a laugh.



"Ha ha... ha... hahaha... hahaha—" In the end, Timothy simply leaned back in the chair and laughed loudly.



He had finally won!



Grace gave up Clearwater Harbor, the Southern Territory, and thus effectively abandoned the claim to the throne of Greycastle.

Ever since learning that the Black Sail fleet was continuously moving north along the coastline, he immediately gathered his subordinates, driving more than five thousand slaves, rats, and criminals straight to the Southern Territory, launching an attack on Grace's stronghold, Clearwater Harbor. The only resistance came from the extreme southern corner's Sand People, who, for some unknown promise, charged forward as if they had no regard for their lives. Moreover, the trouble was that they too possessed the berserk pills.

The battle lasted nearly half a month, with Timothy leveraging his numerical superiority to repeatedly break the enemy's counterattacks and constantly erode the Sand People's defensive lines. Nearly three thousand people died in this war of attrition, and if it weren't for the influence of the pills, this ragtag group would probably not have dared to step onto the battlefield, let alone engage the fierce and ferocious Sand People in direct combat.

The result of the battle was him stepping over layers of corpses to ascend the Lord's Tower of Clearwater Harbor.

The "Queen of Clearwater" had become history, and the Southern Territory of Greycastle was finally back under his control.

"Your Majesty?" Probably hearing his satisfied laughter, a knight guarding the door pushed it open and entered.

"It's fine," Timothy stood up and tilted his head, signaling for him to follow, then ascended to the balcony through the side door of the roundhouse.

The salty sea breeze hit his face, his robes fluttering in the wind, with the distant dark clouds growing denser, suggesting that a heavy rain was imminent.

What a pity, he thought, he had planned to personally witness his sister's harbor, docks, and Lord's Tower turn to ashes in the flames, but it seemed that would not be possible. He had been leading troops in battle away from the capital for the past half year, hardly spending a full month in the King's City, with all state affairs entrusted to the Prime Minister—to whom, although Marquis Wick appeared very loyal, loyalty could not forever fend off temptation, Herman Wimbledon was the best example of that. He must return to the King's City as soon as possible to stabilize the turbulent political situation, and with the rains in the south lasting for several days, he could not wait that long.



"I will set off for the capital early tomorrow morning," Timothy spoke up, "aside from the personal guard and the Knights of the Capital, I'm leaving the other knights and mercenaries under your command. Sir Edith Kant, watch over the Southern Territory for me and don't let the Sand People set foot in Greycastle again."



"You... want me to stay here?" The young knight from the Northern Kant family was taken aback, "But I want to continue fighting for you, Your Majesty. I—"



"Defending the frontier is also fighting for me, Sir," Timothy interrupted, "Listen, there are still many things to be done here, so I must leave a loyal and capable person to handle the aftermath."



"But..." Edith appeared somewhat hesitant.



"I know what you're worried about," the new king said with a smile, patting his shoulder, "Don't worry, you won't be left here forever. Once the situation at Clearwater Harbor is settled, I will immediately call you back to the capital. Greycastle is still not unified. Before reclaiming the Western Territory, I need more knights to charge into battle for me. How could I possibly forget you here?"



He looked up, his eyes shining, and then knelt on one knee, loudly saying, "As you command, Your Majesty!"



"Rise," Timothy nodded in satisfaction, "There are mainly three things you need to do next. The first is to escort all the remaining residents of Clearwater Harbor to the capital."



"You're not going to hang these traitors?" the knight asked in surprise.



"No, they can't be considered real traitors. If they had truly joined Garcia, they would have left with the black-sailed fleet by now. If I killed these people, it would only play right into her hands." However, the influence of his third younger sister was indeed beyond his expectations. A port with more than ten thousand people, plus the slaves captured from Eagle City, ended up with only a little over four hundred unwilling to leave. If it were not for the Sand People's desperate resistance, this port would be no different from a ghost town.



"Your Majesty is merciful."

"The second thing is to burn down the docks, shipyard, and the lord's tower completely. I want everyone in the Southern Territory to see that Grace's old nest no longer exists. Even if she flees back, she will only find ruins."

"Yes," the knight replied.

"The last thing is to collect refugees for me," Timothy said calmly, looking at the horizon where the sea meets the sky. "Any homeless people, rats, bandits, or even the Sand People will do. From the battle at Eagle City to today, the strife in the Southern Territory has never ceased. There should be a large number of refugees in the surrounding villages and towns. The method of collection does not matter. Before the suppression of the Western Territory begins, you must provide me with an army of at least five thousand men."

Grace's escape proved the correctness of his strategy, which was to use the population from most of the land in Greycastle to wear down the resistance—usually, a group of about a hundred knights would lead thousands of civilians into battle. The knights would not participate in the combat, only responsible for distributing the pills and directing the battle. With an absolute numerical advantage, as long as the consumption continued, the enemy would surely be the ones to give in. Grace's retreat, on the contrary, was a decisive move; had she stubbornly held on to Clearwater Port, she would have inevitably been swallowed up by the frenzied civilians who had taken the pills.

Now, his only enemy left was Roland Wimbledon of the Western Territory.
