## The Final Enemy
Timothy Wimbledon walked into the arched dome at the top of the Clearwater Harbor lord's tower.



Unlike the typical castle, this tower building was taller and narrower. Aside from handling state affairs and sightseeing, it probably couldn't even accommodate the gathering of ministers for a council meeting.



The furnishings inside the room had not been moved at all, as if the owner had just left and would soon return. Directly opposite the entrance was a reddish-brown square table, with books neatly arranged on it, and in the center were several unfinished manuscripts, with a quill pen inserted in the ink bottle, ready to continue writing.



He walked step by step to the table and sat in the large chair. The chair was covered with a mat made of stitched bamboo strips, which was very suitable for relieving the heat of summer. Next to the chair was a large bucket of water, obviously for holding ice spikes to cool down and relieve heat, but the weather today was somewhat overcast, with dark clouds pressing low over the sea, so the room did not feel stuffy.



Timothy leaned down and gently sniffed the tabletop, a faint fragrance entered his nostrils—this was the scent of bluebell, Grace's favorite fragrance, produced from Coldwind Ridge, containing a unique sense of coolness compared to roses and rosemary, as if melting the ice and snow of the north into it.



Only by using an item for a long time could it be impregnated with one's own scent, undoubtedly, his sister must have always sat in the chair like this, hands resting on the table, either listening to reports from her subordinates or drafting decrees.



Thinking of this, he couldn't help but laugh out loud.



"Ha ha... ha... ha ha... ha ha ha ha—" In the end, Timothy simply leaned back in the chair, throwing his head back and laughing uproariously.



He had finally won!



Grace abandoned Clearwater Port, abandoned the Southern Territory, and thus equated to abandoning the throne of Greycastle.

Ever since learning that the Black Sail Fleet was continuously sailing northward along the coastline, he immediately gathered his subordinates, driving over five thousand slaves, rats, and criminals straight to the Southern Territory, launching an attack on Grace's old nest, Clearwater Port. The only resistance came from the Sand People at the extreme southern tip. It was unknown what promises they had received, as they rushed forward as if they were not afraid of death. And what's troublesome was that they also possessed the Berserk Pills.

The battle lasted for nearly half a month, with Timothy using his numerical advantage to repel the enemy's counterattacks time and again, and continually eroding the Sand People's defense lines. Nearly three thousand people died in the war of attrition, and had it not been for the influence of the pills, this ragtag bunch probably wouldn't dare set foot on the battlefield at all, let alone engage in a head-on fight with the ferocious and fierce Sand People.

And the result of the battle was him stepping over layers of corpses to ascend the lord's tower of Clearwater Port.

The "Queen of Clearwater" had become history, and the Southern Territory of Greycastle had finally returned under his control.

"Your Majesty?" Probably hearing his hearty laughter, the knight guarding the door pushed it open and entered.

"It's fine." Timothy stood up, tilting his head to signal him to follow, then stepped onto the balcony through the side door of the round house.

The sea breeze, carrying a hint of salt, hit his face, his robes rustling in the wind, with the clouds in the distance growing denser and denser, seemingly indicating that a heavy rain was approaching.

It's a pity, he thought, he had planned to witness with his own eyes his younger sister's port, docks, and the lord's tower turn to ashes in the flames, but it seemed that it wouldn't be possible. He had been leading troops in battle away from the capital for the past half year, hardly spending a full month in the royal city, entrusting all state affairs to the Prime Minister—although Marquis Wick seemed very loyal, loyalty couldn't forever keep temptation at bay, Herman Wimbledon was the best example of this. He must return to the capital as soon as possible to stabilize the undercurrents of the political situation, and the rain in the south could last for several days; he couldn't wait that long.



"I will set off for the capital at dawn tomorrow," Timothy began, "Apart from the personal guards and the capital's Knights, I leave the other knights and mercenaries under your command. Sir Edith Hoss, take good care of the southern territory for me, and don't let the Sand People set foot in Greycastle again."



"You... want me to stay here?" The young knight from the northern Hoss family was taken aback. "But I wish to continue fighting for you, Your Majesty. I—"



"Defending the border is also fighting for me, Sir," Timothy interrupted. "Listen, there is still much to be done here, so I need to leave behind someone loyal and capable to handle the aftermath."



"But..." Edith hesitated.



"I know what you are worried about," the new king said with a smile, patting his shoulder. "Rest assured, you won't be left here forever. Once the affairs at Clearwater Port are settled, I will immediately call you back to the capital. Greycastle is not yet unified, and before we reclaim the western territory, I need more knights to charge into battle for me. How could I possibly forget you here?"



He raised his head, eyes shining, and then knelt on one knee and said loudly, "As you command, Your Majesty!"



"Rise," Timothy nodded in satisfaction. "There are mainly three things you need to do next. The first is to escort all the remaining residents of Clearwater Port to the capital."



"You're not going to execute these traitors?" the knight asked in surprise.



"No, they can't be considered true traitors. If they had really joined Grace, they would have left with the Black Sail Fleet long ago. If I killed these people, it would only play into her hands." However, his younger sister's influence was indeed beyond his expectations. A port of over ten thousand people, including slaves snatched from Eagle City, in the end, only a little more than four hundred were unwilling to leave. If not for the Sand People's fierce resistance, this port would have been no different from a ghost town.



"Your Majesty is merciful."

"The second thing is to burn down the docks, the shipyard, and the lord's tower. I want everyone in the South to see that Grace's den no longer exists. Even if she scurries back, she will only find ruins."

"Yes," the knight replied.

"The last thing is to gather the refugees for me," Timothy said calmly, looking towards the horizon. "Any homeless person, rat, bandit, or even Sand People will do. From the battle at Eagle City to today, the strife in the South has never ceased. There should be a large number of refugees in the surrounding villages and towns. The means of collection do not matter. Before the suppression of the Western Region begins, you must provide me with an army of at least five thousand."

Grace's escape proved the correctness of his strategy, which was to use the population of most of Greycastle's land to wear down the resistance—usually, a detachment of about a hundred knights leads thousands of civilians in the attack. The knights do not participate in the fight; they are only responsible for distributing the pills and directing the battle. With an absolute advantage in numbers, as long as the attrition continues, the enemy will be the one to falter. Grace's retreat, on the contrary, showed her decisiveness. If she had entrenched herself in Clearwater Port, she would have been slowly overwhelmed by the frenzied civilians who had swallowed the pills.

Now his only enemy left was Roland Wimbledon of the Western Region.
