## Cannon Production
Four days later, in the backyard of the smelting area of the Northern Slope mine.



Two deep holes had been dug into the ground of the courtyard, each hole circular in shape, narrow at the top and wider at the bottom. The inner diameter at the front was about twenty centimeters, expanding to twenty-six centimeters at the rear end. These holes were the molds Roland planned to use for casting cannon embryos. The inner walls of the holes had been baked by Anna, with the surface soil sintered into a whole, as if covered with an outer shell. The powder chamber was placed downward to achieve better quality of the tube walls during casting, as the higher the position, the more slag and bubbles it contained. All the dimensions of the holes had been calculated based on the size of the cannonballs; he roughly remembered that historically, the so-called six-pounder and eight-pounder cannons were named after the weight of their projectiles. Therefore, he first cast several twelve-pound iron balls, then calculated the inner diameter of the mold based on the diameter of the iron balls plus the thickness of the cannon wall.



Without precise measuring tools, Roland simply defined his own standard. He cut a piece of iron bar approximately as wide as his own fingernail to use as a basic unit, one centimeter, and proceeded to make other sized iron bars, marking them with sectional lines.



The diameter of the twelve-pound iron ball, measured with a rough iron rod ruler, was about twelve centimeters. He set the thinnest part of the tube wall at four centimeters, and the rear powder chamber was expanded to seven centimeters in thickness to prevent the barrel from bursting, thus obtaining the inner diameter of the mold. As for the length, although he knew that cannons had a caliber to length ratio, he only remembered the ratios for battleships and main battle tanks' main guns. As for antique muzzle-loading cannons, he really had no idea.



Considering that a shorter barrel would be lighter, use less material, and save cost, Roland waved his hand and chose a length of one meter and fifty centimeters. If the test firing results were not satisfactory, adjustments could be made later.



When cannons were first invented, they were made by wrapping iron bars around a wooden core and joining them with iron filings, then reinforcing them with iron hoops and finally burning away the core material in the barrel, much like a storage barrel. Of course, Roland knew that this type of cannon was prone to leakage and bursting, so he opted for a process that involved casting the cannon as a whole and then drilling it with a bore machine. For a steam-powered boring machine, there was no essential difference in difficulty between drilling a six-pounder or a twelve-pounder.



With the belief that "caliber is justice," he naturally chose the twelve-pounder cannon, which had a larger muzzle and a thicker cannon barrel. Anything larger would not be suitable for use as a field gun. As for whether the weight of the projectiles was calculated in lead or iron, it didn’t matter as long as they could be fired. After all, he was drawing from history, not playing with replica models.



"Let's start," Roland took a deep breath and said to Anna. She nodded, grabbed a steel ingot, and held it above the hole. Green flames ignited, the steel ingot quickly reddened, then melted, forming a thin waterfall of molten steel, flowing into the hole. The surface of the molten steel was orange-red, while the core turned incandescent, its brightness difficult to look at directly. To protect the witch's eyesight, Roland had even erected a support at the edge of the hole. She only needed to determine the position in advance and rest her arm on the support pad, so she could pour the molten steel without having to stare at it to see if it was flowing into the hole.



These steel ingots had been slowly accumulated over time, and Anna alone could not usher in an era of mass steel production, but small-scale manufacturing was no problem for her—once the most challenging temperature barrier was overcome, higher quality steel could be obtained through the puddling process.



This was also why Roland dared to set his own specifications for the cannon barrel. Compared to cast iron and bronze barrels, steel cast barrels obviously possessed higher strength. Even if the size was not accurate, the cannon would not easily explode.



The molten steel gradually rose, and the stock of steel ingots was rapidly decreasing, which made Roland feel a bit of heartache. When would he be able to build a pile of chimneys and blast furnaces in his territory and smelt endless amounts of steel? For a long time, the production of steel was one of the standards measuring the strength of a great power, and now he was experiencing it firsthand.



After filling two molds, Anna's cheeks turned rosy red. Roland took out a handkerchief and gently wiped the sweat from the tip of her nose. At first, Anna showed some resistance, but now she obediently stood still, closing her eyes and letting Roland do as he pleased.



Her bangs, illuminated by the glow of the molten steel, took on a reddish hue, and her soft neck was so tempting that one could hardly resist the urge to bite it. When looking down from above, the half-exposed slender collarbone through her neckline would enter his sight. If he was close enough, he could even smell the faint fragrance emanating from her.



"Cough, cough, that's enough for today..." Roland put away the handkerchief and also reined in his stirring emotions, "You did well today. I'll instruct the kitchen to reward you with an extra portion of black pepper steak for dinner."



Not now, he thought, it would be somewhat like taking advantage of her in a vulnerable situation. He would wait, wait until she truly gained her freedom...



Anna opened her eyes, and although the sweat had been wiped away, her face seemed even redder than before. She nodded at Roland and softly responded with a hum.



...



In the following days, Roland traveled back and forth between the castle and the Northern Slope Mine.



In addition to the cannon barrel, he also needed to make a sufficient quantity of boring tools.

These tools used for drilling bore resemblance in their production method to that of the cannon barrels; their diameter was exactly the same as that of the cannonballs. After being removed from the mold, Anna heated it again, and with the help of a hammer, she shaped it. It looked quite different from the standard twist drills, resembling more a blunt-headed iron rod at first glance. The only difference was a notch hammered out at the top, used for the expulsion of metal shavings. The final step was to harden it by quenching, to increase the hardness of the boring tool.

Unlike the high-precision drill bits of modern boring machines, Roland only required an iron rod capable of making holes. Considering their high wear rate, he and Anna made five simple boring tools within a week. Before this, the steam-powered boring machine had already fully demonstrated its capabilities—the production of cast iron cannon barrels had rapidly increased from two a month to ten a day.

Once everything was ready, the cannon blanks were dug out of the pit by the miners, cleaned of surface slag, and then transported to the smithy on a cart.

These two cannon blanks had nearly exhausted all the steel that Roland had accumulated, and it wouldn't be an exaggeration to call them priceless treasures. During transportation, the prince ordered Carter and two knights to guard them throughout the journey, which the Chief Knight felt was somewhat redundant. Who would steal something so heavy?

The blacksmiths, following the Prince's instructions, smoothed and polished the exterior of the cannon blanks. After being ground with a grindstone, they were immediately taken to the backyard of the castle. By then, the two round solid steel rods had a dark grey appearance, radiating a thick metal luster.

Roland could hardly wait to switch to the boring tool, and together with Carter, he secured the cannon blank into place, making sure that the tip of the tool was exactly centered on the steel rod.

Facing this historic moment, Roland pulled down the valve of the steam engine. The boring tool began to rotate slowly, soon reaching a steady speed.

"Advance the cutter!" the Prince shouted.



The Chief Knight manipulated the sliding base to control the contact depth between the cannon embryo and the boring tool. When the cutter head touched the barrel, the shrill noise that ensued immediately drowned out the roar of the steam engine. Lard, serving as a lubricant, was squeezed into the drilling, and what emerged was black foam and curled metal filaments. The witches who had gathered around withdrew from the wooden shed, all except Lightning, who insisted on staying where she was. It seemed that to her, these dark, greasy machines were more beautiful and captivating than any scenery.
