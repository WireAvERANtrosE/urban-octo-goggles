## Family History
"Danger is relative, Mr. Pine, and danger also means opportunity," the Fourth Prince recalled the relevant materials collected by the assistant minister, "I heard that your title was inherited from your father? He was once a knight and later, due to his meritorious service in battle, was granted the barony and fiefdom."



"That's correct," Titus nodded.



"The battle was an honorable one fought on behalf of the innocent, and it also took place during the Evil Months. A small number of demonic beasts accidentally passed through the Redwater River, breaching the stronghold's defenses and entering the hinterlands of the Western Territory. At the time, your father was patrolling that area. When he encountered the remnants of the demonic beasts, he did not choose to avoid them and wait for reinforcements like most would. Behind him lay an undefended townâ€”even though that town had nothing to do with him," Roland stated while observing the other's expression, "You probably know the rest better than I do. Your father gathered the town's militia, took his own squires, and fought the demonic beasts head-on, achieving victory."



"Yes," he said, his tone growing excited, clearly yearning for that piece of family history, "Among them was a giant creature, like a deer and a cow mixed together. Its legs were thicker than my father's torso, and the ground shook when it ran. If it were me, I really wouldn't know how to defeat such a monster."



"But he did it. My father stood near a shallow ditch, luring the raging behemoth to him. As it charged with increased speed, he lay down in the ditch, propped up his broadsword, its hilt braced against a stone at the bottom. That seemingly invincible fool charged straight onto the sword tip, slicing open its belly, spilling its intestines and black blood nearly drowning my father. To this day, a huge demonic beast horn, a trophy from that battle, still hangs above our fireplace."



Roland took a sip of tea and said unhurriedly, "A commendable battle. He followed the knight's creed, compassion and bravery. The one who later granted him his title and fief was Joey Cole, who was then a count of the Longsong Stronghold, promoted to duke by my father, Wimbledon III, twenty-five years ago, and appointed as the guardian of the Southern Border, with territories spanning the entire south. Sadly, after standing on his own, the old Pine family, which remained to the east of the stronghold, became a thorn in the eyes of the new duke of the stronghold."



"Your Highness seems to be well-informed," Titus sighed helplessly, "The duke of the stronghold and Lord Joey have always been at odds. Joey Cole was not a count conferred by the duke of the stronghold; his lineage can be traced back to the royal branch, and in both family and bloodline, he is no less the than Duke of Lion."



This is politics, Roland thought, the balancing act played by Wimbledon III. 



To understand this intricate relationship, he had his assistant minister explain it to him for an entire day.



The divisions and governance among the nobility were extremely chaotic. In theory, a higher-ranking noble had the right to issue commands to lower-ranking nobles within their territory, but in practice, it was much more complex. Joey Cole and the Duke of Lion were examples of this. As an Earl directly enfeoffed by the King, his land was in the Western Territory, but his prestige and influence were no less than that of the Duke of Lion.



When Joey became the Duke of the Southern Territory, new thorns were naturally arranged into his land, a customary tactic used by the royal family of Greycastle to maintain stable governance.



"So after you inherited this land, both trade and agriculture have declined day by day, and your family's fortunes have dwindled," Roland said slowly. "Now, a new opportunity lies before you."



"A new... opportunity?"



"You must have heard of the famine two years ago when the stronghold withheld the next month's food supply, citing insufficient ore trade. This year, we face the same plight. The accidental collapse of the Northern Slope Mine has left the people of Border Town with no retreat, and we must hold back the demonic beasts behind the newly built walls. This battle may not go smoothly, but as I said before, danger also means opportunity."



Titus had already understood the prince's meaning, furrowing his brow without responding immediately.



"Speaking of which, you don't seem like a typical noble," Roland smiled. "No one would go out dressed like this, and your hands are all calloused. Mr. Pine, you haven't given up on your father's legacy, have you? The combat skills that a knight excels in."



Of course, he hadn't given up, Roland thought, or else he wouldn't be running into the Misty Forest all the time. According to the information provided by Barov, during his days in Border Town, he spent at least three days a week in the Misty Forest. And each time he went, he was fully equipped; since he couldn't afford retainers, he directly hired hunters from the town to assist him. Some people have a natural love for battle, and Titus Pine was clearly one of them.



"If you are willing to stay in Border Town, I can give you the opportunity to reclaim your father's glory, to grasp honor with a sword and courage, just like he did. If your achievements are outstanding, I will set aside a piece of land to the east of Border Town to reward you, a piece of land befitting the status of a viscount."



Although such a situation was rare, the promise was effective. As a prince who had come of age, he had the legal right to confer the titles of viscount, baron, and knight, although it was uncommon to bestow titles upon the subordinates of other families. Firstly, because poaching staff from others was considered lacking in noble manners, and secondly, because it would be rather embarrassing if the other party refused. However, Roland didn't care about manners; he simply wanted Nana, the mobile healing station. As for rejection, he wasn't too worried about it. The fact that after Joey became the Guardian of the Southern Territory and didn't conveniently bring his father along proved that the former had already given up on the Pine Family.



Titus finally relented, "Then... Your Highness, may I send Nana back to the Longsong Stronghold? No one here has ever withstood the demonic beasts, and in case of failure, I do not wish for my daughter to be buried here."



"I have told you from the beginning, Mr. Pine, that danger is relative. Have you ever considered what would happen if Nana were discovered to be a witch at the Longsong Stronghold? It's not like Border Town. The Church has taken root in the stronghold for a long time, and they have believers and spies everywhere. Once exposed, even I wouldn't be able to save her."



Roland paused for a moment, then added, "Border Town will not fall. When the Evil Months come, I will fight alongside the townspeople on the city walls. Our opponents are nothing but mutated beasts, not demons impervious to swords and spears. Your father once defeated them in an open field without any cover, let alone we have an insurmountable city wall. If... I mean, if something unexpected does happen, I will have Nana leave first," he paused again, "and Anna too. I'll leave a small boat at the dock, and I promise, they will be safe and sound."



"In that case... I trust you, Your Highness," Titus Pine stood up, knelt on one knee, puffed out his chest, and drew in his belly, giving the prince a proper knightly salute, "I am willing to fight for you."



...



After Titus and Nana left, Anna gave Roland a roll of her eyes.



"Are you dreaming?" she said. "I'm not going anywhere."
