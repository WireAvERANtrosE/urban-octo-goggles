## Family History
"Danger is relative, Mr. Pine, and danger also means opportunity," the Fourth Prince flipped through the relevant information collected by his assistant minister. "I heard your title was inherited from your father? He was once a knight, and was later granted a baron title and territory for his merits in battle."

"That's correct," Titus nodded.

"That battle was an honorable one, fought on behalf of the innocent, during the Evil Months. A small number of demonic beasts unexpectedly crossed the fortress line via the Redwater River, entering the hinterland of the Western Territory. At that time, your father was patrolling the area. When he encountered the remaining demonic beasts, he didn’t choose to avoid them like most people would, notifying reinforcements to encircle and suppress them. Because behind him was a defenseless town—even though that town had nothing to do with him," Roland stated, observing the other's expression. "You should know the rest better than I do. Your father gathered the town's militia, along with his own attendants, and directly combated the demonic beasts, achieving victory."

"Yes," his tone grew somewhat excited, evidently full of admiration for this piece of family history. "Among them was one huge creature, like a deer and a bull, or rather, a monster that seemed to be a mix of the two. Its legs were thicker than my father's body and the ground trembled when it ran. If it were me, I really wouldn't know how to defeat such a monster."

"But he did. My father stood near a shallow ditch, luring the furious beast over. As it accelerated for a charge, he lay down in the ditch, propped up his broadsword, with the hilt leaning on a stone at the bottom of the ditch. That seemingly invincible idiot ran straight into the tip of the sword, its belly was torn open, and the intestines and black blood that flowed out almost drowned my father. There's still a large demonic beast horn, a trophy from that battle, hanging over our fireplace." 

Roland took a sip of tea and said leisurely, "A commendable battle. He adhered to the knight's faith, mercy, and bravery. The one who later granted him his title and territory was Joey Khol, then a count of Longsong Stronghold, promoted to duke by my father, Wimbledon III, twenty-five years ago, taking on the role of Guardian of the Southern Territory, his jurisdiction covering the entire southern boundary. Regrettably, after the stronghold became independent, the old Pains remaining east of the stronghold became a thorn in the Duke's eye."

"Your Highness, you seem to know it very well," Titus sighed a bit helplessly, "the Duke of the stronghold and Sir Joey have always been at odds. Joey Khol is not a count granted by the Duke of the stronghold, his bloodline can be traced back to the royal branch, and in terms of family and lineage, he is no less than Lord Ryan."

This is politics, Roland thought, the balancing act played by Wimbledon III.

In order to understand this intricate relationship, he had called his assistant minister to explain it to him for a whole day.



The distribution and jurisdiction among nobles was extremely chaotic. In theory, the higher-ranking nobles had the right to issue commands to the lower-ranking nobles within their territory, but in practice, it was much more complicated. The cases of Joyce Cole and Duke Ryan were examples. As an earl directly appointed by the king, even though his territory was in the Western Territory, he commanded no less prestige and momentum than Duke Ryan. 

When Joyce became the Duke of the Southern Territory, naturally, new thorns would be arranged into his territory. This was a common means for the Greycastle royal family to maintain stable governance. 

"So when you inherited this territory, both commerce and agriculture began to decline, and your family business deteriorated day by day," Roland said slowly, "Now, a new opportunity is in front of you."

"A new… opportunity?"

"You must have heard about the famine two years ago, the fortress withheld the next month's food on the grounds of insufficient ore trade. And this year, we are facing the same predicament. The accidental collapse of the North Slope Mine left the people of Border Town with no way out, we must block the demonic beasts behind the newly built city wall. The battle may not go smoothly, but as I said before, danger also means opportunity."

"…" Titus had understood the prince's meaning, he furrowed his brow, not answering immediately.

"Speaking of which, you don't seem like a noble in the usual sense," Roland laughed, "No one would go out dressed like you, and your hands, they're all hard calluses. Mr. Pine, you haven't given up your father's legacy, have you? The combat skills that a knight excels at." 

Of course, he hadn't given it up, Roland thought, otherwise, he wouldn't be running into the Hidden Forest all day. According to the information provided by Barov, he spent at least three days a week in the Hidden Forest during his time in Border Town. And each time, he was fully equipped, since he couldn't afford a servant, he simply hired hunters from the town as helpers. Some people naturally loved to fight, and Titus Pine was clearly such a person.

"If you're willing to stay in Border Town, I can give you the chance to regain your father's glory, to seize honor with sword and courage, just like him. If you perform well, I will designate a piece of land on the east side of Border Town as a reward for you, a piece of land suitable for a viscount."



Such situations were not common, but the promise was valid. As a grown-up prince, Roland had the legal right to confer titles of Viscount, Baron, and Knight. However, it was rare to bestow such honours on someone else's subordinate. Firstly, it was seen as underhanded and unbecoming of a noble, and secondly, it would be rather embarrassing if the person refused. But Roland didn't care about propriety. He only wanted Nana, the mobile healing station. As for refusal, he wasn't too worried. The fact that Joey didn't bring his father along after becoming the Guardian of the South showed that he had already given up on the Pine family. 



Finally, Titus relaxed, "Then... Your Highness, may I take Nana back to Longsong Stronghold? No one has ever resisted the demonic beasts here. If it fails, I don't want my daughter to die here."



"I told you from the start, Mr. Pine, danger is relative. Have you ever considered, what would happen if Nana was found to be a witch in Longsong Stronghold? It's not like Border Town. The Church has long been rooted in the city, with their believers and spies everywhere. Once exposed, even I couldn't save her."



Roland paused for a moment, then added, "Border Town will not fall. When the Evil Months come, I will fight alongside the people on the city walls. Our enemies are merely a group of mutated beasts, not invulnerable demons. Your father once defeated them in an open field, not to mention we have an insurmountable city wall. If... I mean, if something unexpected really happens, I will let Nana leave first," he paused again, "And Anna. I will leave a small boat at the dock. I promise, they will be safe."



"In that case... I believe in you, Your Highness," Titus Pine stood up, knelt on one knee, puffed out his chest and gave the standard knight's salute to the prince, "I am willing to fight for you."



...

After Titus and Nana left, Anna rolled her eyes at Roland.



"Are you dreaming?" she said, "I'm not going anywhere."
