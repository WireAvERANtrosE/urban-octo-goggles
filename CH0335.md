## Cataclysm
On the third day, with the completion of the large hot air balloon's assembly, it was time to set off to explore the ruins.

The new hot air balloon was named the Seagull, its massive gondola able to accommodate more witches, and surrounded by canvas screens to fend off the biting winds and heavy snow.

Since it was safer to carry out the operation sooner rather than later, the witches bid a brief farewell to Roland and boarded the hot air balloon. They ascended from the castle's back garden, heading towards the direction of the stone tower.

To ensure a quick landing in case of danger to confront the enemy, Seagull flew very low this time, nearly skimming over the rooftops of the town. Most of the subjects witnessed this "miracle," many standing agape, while others shouted long live Prince Roland—probably in their eyes, such a miracle could only be created by the Lord of Border Town. As they passed the western city wall, the First Army soldiers saluted in unison. Both Lightning and Maggie, who accompanied them in flight, were familiar witches to them, especially the little girl Lightning, who often guided the artillery team's firing direction, was greeted with enthusiastic cheers from the soldiers.

Soon, amidst the scattered snowflakes, Seagull left the town behind and entered the Hidden Forest area.

Tilly stood at the edge of the gondola, gazing at the boundless forest.

The snow season, which lasted the entire Evil Months, turned the world into a vast expanse of white. The treetops were engulfed in snow, appearing at first glance like wide, flat platforms jutting out from the ground. On the other side of the view lay layers upon layers of mountains, showing a grayish-green color through the hazy mist, the foot of the mountains obscured from sight, making the rolling peaks seem as if they were floating in mid-air.

"What a beautiful scene," Sylvie exclaimed. "This is my first time seeing the Western Region covered in snow."

"Are you a witch from the Western Region?" Wendy asked curiously.



"I originally lived in Fallen Dragon Ridge, which is close to the south where it rarely snows in winter. It was only after hearing the news about Lady Tilly opening up Sleeping Island that I secretly took a ship to Clearwater Port to meet up with other witches."

"I see," Wendy said with a smile, shaking her head. "Our Prince has been complaining about how, despite the rumors that the Witch Cooperation Association is settling in Border Town, no witches have come... He's always one step behind."

"Eh, you guys also released a message to gather witches?"

"They did, but unfortunately they weren't very skilled. I noticed them right when they reached Fallen Dragon Ridge," Ashes said proudly, "I even caught one of them red-handed in Silver City. His name was Tassa, I think?"

"You're a witch, of course you'd notice such a strange rumor," Andrea said with a sneer. "If you hadn't met Lady Tilly, you might have gone to Border Town a long time ago."

"I wouldn't go for Prince Roland—"

"Oh," she mimicked the other's tone, "Your Highness... you seem quite familiar with that title."

"Pfft," Tilly couldn't help but laugh out loud, seeing her looking downtrodden just yesterday, and now she seemed to be back to her normal self. In Sleeping Island, the only person who would dare to trouble Ashes at any time was the distinguished Andrea, "Whether it's on Sleeping Island or in Border Town, we are all compatriots, so let's not divide ourselves." 

She turned her head, her gaze sweeping over the many witches.



Before setting out, everyone had already familiarized themselves with each other's abilities, so as to allocate tasks more reasonably when encountering the enemy. It can be said that there are far fewer combat witches in Border Town than on Sleeping Island, and most witches are not suited for battle. But it is precisely their relentless efforts that have built the town into what it is now.



Tilly's gaze rested on Anna. If she had to choose the one who made the most impression on her, it would likely be this woman who awakened in the remote frontier, having a profound influence on Roland.



Just by standing beside her, one could feel an indescribable sense of weight and tranquility. It was a sensation Tilly had never encountered before; if she had to describe it, it was like lying on a vast field, the softness and solidity from behind providing an incomparable sense of security.



Besides her interactions with Roland, Anna didn't talk much, nor did her expressions change often. However, when standing among the witches, she was hard to ignore.



Moreover, according to Sylvie, Anna was one of the first witches in Border Town to evolve, possessing an immense magical power. Her ability to freely transform the shape of her extraordinary blackfire was formidable, and she was also the first witch to have finished reading "The Basics of Natural Science Theories," which gave Tilly a sense of kinship.



In this winter, if she could sit by the fireplace with her and discuss the wondrous knowledge from the books, it would surely be a very delightful thing. Tilly was filled with anticipation for this.



The fifth princess then shifted her gaze to Lightning outside the basket. As the daughter of Thunder, she shared many similarities with that first explorer of the Fjords. Lively, curious, and full of initiative, she was born for flying. Tilly thought that only the boundless sky could accommodate her ceaseless heart. Thunder might wish for his daughter to live a quiet life, but upon meeting the young girl, Tilly understood that she was destined to become an explorer, perhaps even surpassing her father's achievements.



All she could do was to protect her as best as she could.



"We're almost there," Lightning approached the basket and announced to everyone.



"Come in and rest," Wendy said with a concerned look, "Your lips are all white from the cold."

"It's fine, just a bit numb on my face," she patted her rosy-white cheeks, "Luckily I have the scarf His Highness gave me, my ears aren't cold at all."



On the way, we didn't encounter any ferocious devils. The demonic beasts wandering in the forest would occasionally raise their heads and roar, but they clearly lacked the ability to attack the hot air balloon in the sky, so the first half of the journey was relatively smooth. However, when the Longsong arrived at its destination above, everyone was stunned by the sight before them.



The forest looked as if it had been swept by something gigantic, with tree trunks and branches scattered all around. The snow had been completely overturned and mixed with the soil, making the scene look chaotic and messy.



"Where's the stone tower?" Ashes asked.



"It used to be there," Lightning pointed to the clearing below, her tone full of disbelief, "It... it's gone."



Tilly looked in the direction she was pointing and saw a huge hole in the mixed brown and white ground, dark and bottomless, as if someone had carved a passage to the abyss right there. Judging by the size of the hole, the creature that made it must be incredibly large.



"Sylvie, see what's inside the hole."



Sylvie's brow quickly furrowed, and her complexion turned grim, "A... a creature that looks like a maggot, it's moving in a northwest direction, wait, the relic is inside its stomach!"



"What, inside its belly?" Ashes exclaimed in surprise.

"Yes, I saw the stone tower... and the ice coffin you mentioned," she identified carefully, "My god, it swallowed the whole relic!"

What should they do next? Everyone instinctively looked toward Tilly.

"Is there nothing else besides the bugs?" Princess Tilly asked gravely, "Especially devils."

"Um... there are also some demonic beasts, but they're all inside its belly, they seem to be dead," Sylvie observed for a while before shaking her head.

Tilly thought for a moment and then decisively said, "We land now. Some will guard outside, while others will follow me into the cave to kill the beast and retrieve the ice coffin."
