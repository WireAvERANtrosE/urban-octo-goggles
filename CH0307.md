## Death from Above
The hot air balloon flew at an altitude of over two thousand meters, the distance measured by Lightning's vertical flight.

All she needed to do was lift her head to see the clouds close at hand, like loose tufts of cotton, but to actually touch them, she would still need to ascend a few hundred meters more.

The entire hot air balloon was painted with alternating blue and white patches, making it look exactly like the sky from afar. She was also dressed in camouflage, and the same went for "Eastwind No. 1". According to His Highness's orders, this surprise attack had to be sudden and covert, so the First Army disembarked from the ships before reaching the Silver City dock and proceeded on foot to the back of a nearby mountain range.

Under Sylvie's surveillance, the team's route avoided all eyes, and from beginning to end, no one noticed them. After setting up camp, the next day, the Seagull slowly ascended and began its bombardment mission.

Including the week spent on the road, today was the beginning of the Mid-Autumn month.

The white shadow flying in front of the balloon was Maggie, who took on the task of guiding and scouting since it was inconvenient to observe from within the basket. As a white-tailed goshawk, even at high altitudes, she could quickly distinguish the roads connecting towns and the carriages racing along them—her eagle eyes were much more useful than a lookout glass in this respect.

Fortunately, the enemy couldn't correct the bomb drop points, Lightning thought to herself, otherwise, she would have nothing to do.

"Tired?" Anna asked, leaning over the edge of the basket. "Come in and rest for a while, there won't be any devils showing up here anyway."

The little girl shook her head, "At this speed, I can fly all day."



"Feeling a bit nervous?" Wendy leaned over as well.



"Not at all," she pouted, "I've practiced so many times already. Besides, the palace is so huge, it's simply impossible to miss."



"Is that so?" Wendy smiled. "Either way, don't overdo it. His Highness said safety comes first. And... what happened when we went to scout the Devil's camp wasn't your fault."



"What, I..."



The other spoke in a gentle tone, "Anyone can see you've been down these past few days, but you're not afraid of fighting; you're just not good at it. If it were me in your place, I may not have done any better."



"Indeed, the reflexes and agility that Nightingale possesses are something most witches don't have," Anna also offered comfortingly, "Why don't you come in and take a short break? The magic power required to adjust the bomb's dropping point is not insignificant."



Hearing both of them say this, Lightning gave a soft snort through her nose and with her head hanging, flew into the hanging basket. Before she even touched the ground, Wendy embraced her tightly, "No one blames you, so you shouldn't blame yourself either, you know?"



"Mhm..."

...



After a morning of flight, Maggie flapped her wings back to the Seagull, reporting to the three people: "The royal capital of Greycastle is just ahead, we're almost there coo."



Lightning flew out of the basket, raising her telescope—as Prince Roland had said, the magnificent and spectacular walls of the capital were clearly distinguishable even from the sky; it was like a blue line, twisting and turning to outline the city's boundaries. In the center of the grey patches, a white spot the size of a fingernail was particularly striking.



According to the plan, they were supposed to scatter leaflets first, then drop the Eastwind No. 1. However, after several trial drops, they found that it was impossible to control the direction of the falling papers from a height of two kilometers, and it was still ineffective even with added weights. If they were to drop them from a lower altitude, it would be easy for people to spot the target, especially since the Seagull was huge, and with papers constantly falling from the sky, it would be difficult to hide their presence under the watchful eyes of the public.



Therefore, His Royal Highness the Prince ultimately cancelled the leaflet portion, instead entrusting Theo with spreading the news, and all they needed to do was to drop the bomb over the palace.



Wendy controlled the airflow, keeping the basket steadily suspended over the capital.



"Are you ready?"



"Pull the valve," Lightning nodded.



Then all she heard was a buzzing sound, as the heavy ordnance detached from the basket, plummeting straight down. Due to the sudden decrease in weight, the hot air balloon jerked upwards for a moment.



For the next steps, she was already well-practiced.



The deceleration parachute at the end of the Eastwind No. 1 was opened by the airflow, and Lightning quickly caught up with the bomb, beginning to correct its trajectory bit by bit.



The royal capital was not unfamiliar to the witches of the Witch Cooperation Association. During their journey to the wilderness to search for the Holy Mountain, they had hidden in the slums of this city for several months. Firstly, to gather food, and secondly, to recruit new blood. Sorya and Echo joined the Association during this period. Although Lightning had not experienced this herself, she often heard them mention it. Compared to other cities, the royal capital was very strict in its witch hunts. In the outer city area, on the steps of the plaza, witches were executed nearly every month. Therefore, they stayed here for the shortest time, because with each additional day spent, they had to bear the pain of another sister's passing.



Lightning held no fondness for this bustling capital. If she could drop the bomb right above Timothy's head, putting an end to his rule, she would be more than willing to do so. If Roland were to govern the Kingdom of Greycastle, perhaps none of these tragedies would have happened, right?



Now she had a chance to correct the mistakes.



The sound of the wind howled by her ears, and the scenery on the ground continued to expand. The details of the royal palace in the inner city area gradually became clear before Lightning's eyes.



Compared to the low houses where civilians lived, the scale of the palace buildings was much larger—it consisted of a domed hall, a banquet hall, and a high tower castle, with auxiliary buildings such as stables, barracks, and warehouses all available. Considering the steep walls of the castle and the complex roof structures, it wasn't easy to trigger the fuse, so His Highness ultimately chose the palace hall as the attack target.



As the altitude rapidly decreased, the deceleration parachute soon reached the release point. Lightning pulled the mechanism, allowing the parachute to separate from the bomb, and at the same time, she hugged it and quickly climbed upward.



Before leaving, His Royal Highness repeatedly reminded her to ascend to a sufficiently high and safe position before the bomb hit the ground and not to look back at the explosion. However, the young girl couldn't suppress her curiosity and couldn't help lowering her head—



She saw a dazzling flash of light ignite at the top of the hall, expanding rapidly.



The incandescent light turned into a bright orange-red, then disappeared into the rolling dust. This process lasted less than a moment before a deafening explosion suddenly erupted beside her ears, nearly causing her to lose her balance.

Lightning was not unfamiliar with the thunderous battlefields of gunfire, but compared to those terrifying weapons that fired iron balls, the roar from the Eastwind was tenfold louder than all of them combined!

Smoke violently spewed out from around the pillars and windows of the hall, engulfing the surrounding garden and corridors. In no time, several cracks appeared in the circular dome, centered around the point of the bomb's impact.

Lightning could not help but stop in her tracks, holding her breath as she stared at the hall's final moments.

These black lines, like ink flowing unrestrained, instantly covered the entire roof, and then the ceiling could no longer support itself, collapsing with a thunderous crash, raising an even denser cloud of dust.

Under the astonishing might of the Eastwind, the royal palace's main hall collapsed.
