## Death descended from the heavens.
The hot air balloon flew at an altitude of over two thousand meters, a distance measured by Lightning's vertical flight.

By simply raising her head, she could see the clouds that were almost within reach, resembling loose tufts of cotton, but to truly touch them, she would have to fly hundreds of meters higher.

The entire hot air balloon was painted with blue and white patches, making it look identical to the sky from a distance. She too was dressed in camouflage, and even the "Eastwind No.1" was the same. As per His Highness's orders, this surprise attack had to be sudden and covert, so the First Army disembarked from their ships before reaching the Silver City docks and proceeded on foot to the reverse side of the nearby mountains.

Under Sylvie's surveillance, the troop's route avoided all eyes, and from beginning to end, they did not attract anyone's attention. After setting up camp, the next day the Lookout soared into the sky, beginning its bombing mission.

Including the week spent on the road, today was just the start of the Mid-Autumn month.

The white shadow flying in front of the balloon was Maggie. Because the basket was inconvenient for observation, she took up the task of navigation and scouting. After transforming into a wild eagle with a white tail, she could quickly distinguish the roads connecting towns and the carriages running on them—even at high altitudes, her eagle eyes were much more useful than a spyglass.

Fortunately, the enemy couldn't correct the bomb drop points, Lightning thought to herself, otherwise, she would really have nothing to do.

"Are you tired?" Anna leaned over the edge of the basket and asked, "Come in and rest for a while, there won't be any devils appearing here anyway."

The little girl shook her head, "At this speed, I can fly all day."



"Feeling a bit nervous?" Wendy leaned in as well.



"Not at all," she pouted, "I've practiced so many times, and besides, the palace is so big, it's basically impossible to miss."



"Is that so?" Wendy smiled, "Regardless, don't overdo it. His Highness said safety is the most important thing. And... what happened during the scouting of the Devil's camp wasn't your fault."



"What, I..."



The other person spoke with a gentle tone, "Anyone can see how downcast you've been these days, but it's not because you're afraid of fighting, you're just not good at it. If I were in your place, I might not have done any better."



"Indeed, the reflexes and agility that Nightingale possesses are not something most witches have," Anna also consoled, "You should come in and rest a bit. The magic power needed to adjust the bomb's drop point later isn't small."



Hearing both of them say this, Lightning snorted softly through her nose and drooped her head as she flew into the basket. Before she even landed, Wendy embraced her tightly, "No one will blame you, so you don't need to blame yourself, you know?"



"Mhm..."

...



After a morning of flying, Maggie flapped her wings and returned to the Seagull, reporting to the three of them, "The capital of Greycastle is just ahead, we're almost there, coo."

Lightning flew out of the basket, raising her looking glass—as Prince Roland had said, the majestic and spectacular walls of the capital were clearly distinguishable even from the sky. They looked like a thin, aquamarine line, awkwardly outlining the extent of the city. In the center of the grey patches, a nail-sized white spot was particularly striking.



According to the plan, they were supposed to scatter leaflets first, and then drop the Dongfeng-1. However, after several test drops, they found that it was impossible to control the direction of the paper's fall from a height of two kilometers, and it was no good even if they added weights. Dropping from a lower height would make it easy for people to spot the target, especially since the Seagull was huge and with paper continuously falling from the sky, it would be difficult to hide their presence under the watchful eyes of the public.



Therefore, Prince Roland ultimately canceled the leaflet part and instead handed over the task of spreading the news to Tassa. They only needed to drop the bombs above the palace.



Wendy manipulated the airflow, keeping the basket steadily suspended above the capital.



"Are you ready?"



"Pull up the valve," Lightning nodded her head.



Following that, she heard a buzzing sound; the heavy projectile had already separated from the basket, plummeting straight down. Due to the sudden decrease in weight, the hot air balloon sharply rose upward for a moment.



For the next steps, she was already well-prepared.



The deceleration parachute at the tail of "East Wind No.1" was stretched open by the airflow, and Lightning quickly caught up with the bomb, beginning to correct its trajectory bit by bit.



The capital was not unfamiliar to the witches of the Witch Cooperation Association. During their journey to the Wildlands in search of the Holy Mountain, they had hidden in the slums of this city for several months. The purpose of their stay was twofold: first, to collect food, and second, to recruit new blood. It was during this time that Soria and Echo joined the Witch Cooperation Association. Although Lightning had not experienced this herself, she often heard them mention it—compared to other cities, the capital was very strict about capturing witches. In the outer district's stairway square, witches were executed nearly every month. Therefore, their stay here was the shortest because each additional day meant enduring the pain of another sister's passing.



Lightning had no fondness for this bustling capital. If she could drop the bomb right above Timothy's head, putting an end to his reign once and for all, she would be more than happy to do so. Perhaps if Roland were to rule the Kingdom of Greycastle, such tragedies would never happen?



Now, she had a chance to correct a mistake.



The sound of the wind howled in her ears, and the scenery on the ground rapidly expanded, with the details of the palace in the inner city district gradually coming into view in front of Lightning.



Compared to the low houses where the civilians lived, the scale of the palace buildings was much larger—it consisted of a domed hall, a banquet hall, and a high tower castle, with auxiliary buildings such as stables, barracks, and warehouses all available. Considering the steep walls of the castle and the complex roof structures, it was not easy to trigger the fuse; thus, His Highness had chosen the palace hall as the target for the attack.



As the altitude dropped sharply, the parachute quickly reached the detachment point. Lightning pulled the mechanism, allowing the canopy to release from the bomb while she swiftly climbed upwards with it.



Before leaving, His Highness had repeatedly reminded her to ascend to a high enough safe position before the bomb hit the ground, and not to look back at the explosion. However, the young girl could not contain her curiosity and couldn't help but lower her head—



She saw a dazzling flash of light ignite at the top of the hall, which rapidly expanded outward.



The incandescent light turned into a bright orange-red, then vanished into the rolling dust. This process lasted less than a moment, then a deafening explosion suddenly burst in her ears, almost making her lose her balance.

Lightning had seen the battlefield roar with gunfire, but compared to those terrifying weapons that fired iron balls, the roar from the Eastwind was ten times louder than all of them combined!

Smoke furiously spewed out from around the pillars and windows of the hall, engulfing the surrounding gardens and corridors. Before long, several cracks appeared in the circular dome, centered around the point of the bomb's impact.

Lightning couldn't help but stop in her tracks, holding her breath as she watched the last moments of the hall.

These black lines, like wanton flowing ink, instantly covered the entire roof, and then the roof could no longer support itself, collapsing with a bang, raising a thicker cloud of dust.

Under the astonishing power of the Eastwind, the royal palace's grand hall collapsed.
