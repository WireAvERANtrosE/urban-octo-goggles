## Acid Making
Kyle Sichi had hardly slept these past few days, and he found that coming to Border Town was the most correct decision he had made in his life.



He spent two days and a night flipping through "Elementary Chemistry," slept for a couple of hours, and then he was once again full of energy. Now, he had returned to the first page to meticulously study this ancient tome.



Matter is composed of extremely small particles! The change of matter is the decomposition and recombination of particles! During the reaction process, the total amount of matter remains unchanged!



Good heavens, what kind of person was the author of this book to describe the world that people can't see with such clarity? He had doubted more than once that the content of the book was all made up, but when he conducted alchemical experiments according to the examples provided, the results completely matched! Moreover, some common examples in reality could prove the correctness of the book.



For instance, the "oxygen" described in the first chapter.



This gas is the main component of air, and what people breathe is not air, but oxygen. The need for oxygen in flames is because combustion is essentially an oxidation reaction. The more oxygen there is, the more vigorous the combustion.



This reminded him of the glass kiln in Redwater City, which required two people to continuously operate the bellows to raise the temperature inside the kiln to the melting point of sand and stone. Since it is a substance, obviously it could be extracted as pure oxygen through alchemical... no, through chemical reactions. If oxygen could be directly fed into the kiln, could the bellows equipment be dispensed with?



And what's more astonishing is that the book says water is actually composed of two hydrogen particles and one oxygen particle, which is probably why all living things need to drink water. However, hydrogen also seems to be a gas, and two gases combine to become a liquid—how is that accomplished?



Kyle realized he still had many questions to ponder. But one thing was beyond doubt, he was already ahead of all other alchemists. While they were still groping for formulas in chaos and fog, a straight and smooth road had appeared before him.



However, business still had to be attended to. He closed the book reluctantly. The sky was beginning to lighten; it was time to work again.

Kyle blew out the candle and went to check on his wife and daughter, who were still sound asleep, before quietly leaving the house.

The residence assigned to him by His Highness was located to the west of the castle and was considerably larger than his home in Redwater City. The walls were built with bricks and stones, which were much more comfortable than the easily moldy wood, and the house was fully furnished with both furniture and kitchenware. Although he didn't say it out loud, he felt quite satisfied in his heart. His disciples lived in another district two streets away, where the houses were smaller and not individual dwellings. It was somewhat like the arrangement of an inn, where one bedroom could accommodate four people.



Arriving at the chemical laboratory by the Redwater River, his disciples had already started their busy work. They were people Kyle had carefully selected, having learned to clean materials in alchemy workshops almost from childhood, and were now between twenty and thirty years old. Seeing the clean laboratory and the sparkling glass containers, Kyle nodded in satisfaction.



"Good morning, Chief Alchemist," the disciples greeted with a bow.



"Let's begin." He took out a pair of gloves from the cabinet and put them on—these gloves were extremely light and elastic, probably sewn from animal intestines. Previously, there was no such rule in the alchemy workshop, but Prince Roland had repeatedly emphasized the dangers of chemical experiments. In the operating regulations, it was mandatory to wear gloves when dealing with corrosive material reactions, and all windows had to be opened.



Unlike the workshop, their current work was very clear: to produce acid for His Highness. They had performed the method of producing acid from vitriol many times, so Kyle only needed to supervise and instruct, without having to do the work himself.



Both types of acid were detailed in "Elementary Chemistry"; one was called sulfuric acid, and the other was called nitric acid. He was previously accustomed to naming them after the substances used to make them, such as calling the former green vitriol acid and the latter saltpeter acid. Despite the different names, the production methods were essentially the same: obtaining acid vapor by dry distillation of green vitriol and saltpeter, followed by condensation to collect the acid liquid. Green vitriol was usually found with sulfur ore, and saltpeter was produced in special niter pools in large cities, both being common materials.



However, His Highness emphasized that the concentration of the two acids needed to be high and specifically instructed on the purification methods.



For example, after collecting the sulfuric acid, it can be heated to evaporate the water, ultimately obtaining concentrated sulfuric acid with a purity of up to ninety-eight percent. However, producing nitric acid is much more troublesome. According to His Highness, this acid is inherently unstable, prone to volatilization, and when its concentration is high enough, it can even decompose upon exposure to light. Therefore, the distillation of dilute nitric acid must be mixed with concentrated sulfuric acid and heated, allowing the sulfuric acid to absorb the water and vaporize the nitric acid, which is then stored in brown glass bottles. For this purpose, His Highness has specially prepared a thermometer.



Kyle was amazed at the thermometer when he first saw it, thinking it was a marvel of craftsmanship. Inside a hollow glass tube was mercury, and both ends were sealed, so there was no worry about the mercury leaking out. There were several painted lines on it, and as it was heated, the mercury would gradually rise, and the position it stopped at represented the current temperature.



Now, the laboratory has produced three bottles of concentrated sulfuric acid and one bottle of concentrated nitric acid. At this concentration, he realized that sulfuric acid does not flow as easily as water; it is more like a somewhat viscous oil. Nitric acid, when highly concentrated, is no longer colorless and transparent but becomes pale yellow. Just by opening the cap of the glass bottle, it would emit puffs of white smoke.



"Master, do we need to produce these two acids every day?" a disciple named Amon asked.



"Until His Highness gives us new orders," Kyle paused, "What's the matter, worried that you won't have time to explore alchemy formulas?"



Amon nodded.



Kyle stroked his chin beard and laughed, "I forgot to tell you, we no longer need the title of alchemist, so you don't have to rely on exploring formulas to become one."



"No..." Amon was stunned, "Not needed anymore?" The other disciples also slowed down their work and listened intently to what the teacher was about to say.



"That's right, alchemy formulas do not need to be explored by guesswork anymore but through memorization and deduction," Kyle clapped his hands and gathered everyone around him, "His Highness has given me a book called 'Elementary Chemistry'—this is also the reason I brought you all here. If we study it thoroughly, most formulas in the world can be deduced based on its content."



"Speculate?" The disciples let out a low murmur.



"That's right. Once I have read through it in detail, I will start teaching it to you," he said. "As for the path to promotion, His Highness has also mentioned it to me. From now on, you must pass the tests personally arranged by him to obtain the title of Chemist. Believe me, it won't be long before this honorary title completely surpasses that of an Alchemist. And the knowledge you possess will be something even the King's Alchemist Association can't hope to match."
