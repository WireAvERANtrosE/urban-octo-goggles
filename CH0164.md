## Acid Making
Kamol Striel had barely slept these past few days, realizing that coming to Border Town was the most correct decision he had made in his life.
It took him two days and one night to skim through "Elementary Chemistry." After sleeping for just two or three hours, he was again spirited and alert. Now, he had returned to the first page to carefully study this ancient tome.
Matter is composed of extremely small particles! The transformation of matter is the decomposition and recombination of particles! During the reaction process, the total amount of matter remains constant!
My god, what kind of person could have written this book, to describe the world that is invisible to the naked eye with such clarity? More than once, he doubted whether the contents of the book were all made up, but when he conducted alchemical experiments following the examples given, the results were all a perfect match! Moreover, some common examples in reality also proved the correctness of the book.
For instance, the "oxygen" described in the first chapter.
This gas is the main component of the air, and what people breathe is not air, but oxygen. The need for oxygen in combustion is because combustion is essentially an oxidation reaction. The more oxygen there is, the more vigorous the combustion.
These words reminded him of the glass furnace in Redwater City, which required two men to continuously operate the bellows to raise the temperature to the melting point of sand. Since it is a substance, it could clearly be extracted in its pure form through alchemy... no, through chemical reactions. If one could directly pump oxygen into the furnace, wouldn't it be possible to save the bellows equipment?
And the most astonishing thing was that the book claimed water was composed of two hydrogen particles and one oxygen particle, which is probably why all living beings need to drink water. However, hydrogen also seems to be a gas, and the combination of two gases turns into a liquid—how is that achieved?
Kamol found that he still had many questions to ponder. However, one thing was beyond doubt: he was already ahead of all the alchemists. While they were still groping for formulas in chaos and fog, a straight and smooth road had appeared before his eyes.

However, there are still matters that need to be attended to. He closed the book reluctantly. The sky was beginning to lighten, signaling the start of the workday.

Kyle Sichi blew out the candle and approached the bedroom to take a glance at his wife and daughter, who were still sound asleep, before quietly stepping out the door.

The residence assigned to him by His Highness was located to the west of the castle and was considerably larger than his home in Redwater City. The walls were built with bricks and stone, which were far more comfortable than the easily moldy wood, and the house was fully furnished with all kinds of furniture and kitchenware. Although he didn't voice it, he was quite satisfied in his heart. His disciples lived in another district two streets away from him, with smaller houses that were not individual residences; they were more like a hostel setup, with one bedroom accommodating four people.

When he arrived at the chemical laboratory by the Redwater River, the disciples had already started their busy work. They were people Kyle Sichi had carefully selected, almost all of whom had been learning to clean materials in the alchemy workshop since they were children, and were now between twenty and thirty years old. Seeing the spotlessly cleaned laboratory and the shiny glass containers, Kyle Sichi nodded in approval.

"Good morning, Chief Alchemist," the disciples greeted him with a bow.

"Let's start," he said, taking out a pair of gloves from the cabinet and putting them on—the gloves were extremely thin and elastic, probably made of stitched animal intestines. Such a rule had never existed in the alchemy workshop before, but Prince Roland emphasized the dangers of chemical experiments repeatedly. According to the operating rules, gloves must be worn when dealing with corrosive materials, and all windows must be open.

Unlike in the workshop, their task was now very clear: to produce acid for His Highness. They had performed the lead chamber process for making acid many times before, so Kyle Sichi only needed to supervise and give directions, without having to get involved himself.

These two types of acid were detailed in "Elementary Chemistry," one called sulfuric acid and the other nitric acid. He used to name them by the products, calling the former green vitriol acid and the latter saltpeter acid. Although the names were different, the methods of producing them were essentially the same; acid vapors were obtained through the dry distillation of green vitriol stones and saltpeter, and then the acids were collected through condensation. Green vitriol was usually found together with sulfur ore, and saltpeter was produced in special niter beds in large cities—both were common materials.

However, His Highness emphasized that the two acids he required must be of high concentration and specifically instructed a method for purification.

For example, after sulphuric acid is collected, it can be heated to evaporate the water, eventually yielding a concentration of up to 98% concentrated sulphuric acid. However, nitric acid is much more troublesome. According to His Royal Highness, this acid is inherently unstable, prone to evaporation, and upon reaching a certain concentration, it can even decompose when exposed to light. Thus, the distillation of dilute nitric acid must be mixed with concentrated sulphuric acid and heated, allowing the sulphuric acid to absorb the water and vaporize the nitric acid, which is then stored in brown glass bottles. For this, His Royal Highness has even specially prepared a thermometer.

Kyle saw it for the first time and thought it a marvel of ingenuity—a hollow glass tube filled with mercury, sealed at both ends, so there was no worry of mercury leaking. There are several painted rings on it, and as it is heated, the mercury rises gradually, with its final position indicating the current temperature.

Now, the laboratory has produced three bottles of concentrated sulphuric acid and one bottle of concentrated nitric acid. At this concentration, he realized that sulphuric acid does not flow as easily as water, but rather is more like a somewhat viscous oil. Nitric acid at high concentrations is no longer colorless and transparent but has turned a pale yellow, and a plume of white smoke is emitted as soon as the glass bottle is opened.

"Master, do we need to produce these two acids every day?" asked a disciple named Amon.

"Until His Royal Highness assigns us a new task," Kyle paused, "Why? Worried that you won't have time to explore alchemical formulas?"

Amon nodded.

Kyle stroked his stubbled chin and laughed, "I forgot to tell you, the title of 'alchemist' is no longer needed, so you don't have to rely on exploring formulas to become alchemists."

"No..." Amon was stunned, "No longer needed?" The other disciples also slowed their work, turning their ears to listen to what their teacher would say next.

"That's right, alchemical formulas no longer need to be explored through trial and error but through memorization and deduction," Kyle clapped his hands, gathering everyone around, "His Royal Highness has given me a book called 'Elementary Chemistry'—and that's why I brought you all here. If we study it thoroughly, most of the formulas in the world can be deduced from its contents."

"Speculate?" The disciples let out a low exclamation.

"That's right. Once I have read through it in detail, I will start teaching you," he said. "As for the path to advancement, His Highness has also mentioned it to me. From now on, you must pass the tests he personally arranges to earn the title of chemist. Believe me, it won't be long before this honorable title completely surpasses that of an alchemist. And the knowledge you possess will be beyond even the reach of the Alchemist Association of the king's city."
