## Fear
In recent days, Tassa had been in contact with His Highness the Prince once a day.

Despite having witnessed many incredulous events in the year since he started serving as the Prince's personal guard, the new orders still felt unbelievable and... confusing.

To portray the attack on the King's City palace as Roland Wimbledon's punishment of Timothy Wimbledon?

When the militia that had attacked the Western Territory retreated back to King's City, Tassa had heard about the "warning" they brought with them. Initially, he thought it was just a bluff from His Highness, or a strategy to distract—while Timothy focused on vigilance and defense, His Highness would attack other cities, just as Grace had done, plundering his opponents before the onset of winter.

However, the subsequent orders from Border Town made him feel uneasy; it seemed that His Highness was indeed planning to attack King's City and was asking him to prepare for the propaganda. The latest order clearly stated that the attack would be launched on the first day of mid-autumn, exactly the same time as mentioned in the "warning."

Look at this phrase, "to portray the palace's suffering as punishment," which means that His Highness intends to directly attack the inner city of King's City—but how could that be possible? King's City has the strongest walls in Greycastle, thick enough to accommodate two houses side by side, and even His Highness's cannons would struggle to destroy them. And with the King's City Knights, the Royal Guards, and the conscripted militia, it would be very difficult to breach the city without an army of over ten thousand.

A surprise attack using witches is equally preposterous. The Divine Stone of Judgement is abundant in the palace, and giant God's Punishment Stones are installed in places like the great hall and the sleeping chambers. Witches would be stripped of all their powers as soon as they stepped into a room. This is also why Timothy could carry out a large-scale witch hunt without fear of reprisal—assassinating a royal noble within the palace was simply impossible.

Furthermore, this method had a hidden risk—if Timothy Wimbledon was truly killed by a witch's hand, the biggest beneficiary would likely be the church... With a little guidance, it would be easy to affirm the charges against the fourth prince of attempting to usurp the throne with the devil's minions, while the nobles would also unite to resist his power. However, with Roland His Highness's intelligence, Tassa believed he would surely see this point.

So how exactly does His Highness plan to breach the inner city?



"Sir, you summoned me?" Pushing open the half-closed door, Hill Fawkes entered the living room.

"Wait for a new order," Tassa spread his hands, "Please have a seat first."

"...Yes."

Seeing the former acrobat's face filled with surprise, he could only smile helplessly. Normally, he would receive clear instructions before notifying these people, but this time it was inconvenient to share the task assigned by His Highness in advance — if the King's City palace was not attacked, such seemingly absurd orders could easily diminish their trust.

On the contrary, if His Highness really achieved this, it would undoubtedly be a shock like no other for them, and would greatly boost their confidence — especially witnessing with their own eyes that His Highness, from thousands of miles away, could pose a real threat to Timothy's throne. Such propaganda would be more effective than exhausting all his rhetoric.

Therefore, Tassa chose a compromise. He called Hill into the inner city area to wait for His Highness to make his warning a reality. If successful, they would all rejoice; if not, he could simply claim that perhaps the messenger was delayed on the road.

"Have some tea," Tassa said with a smile, "Don't always wear your doubts on your face. As an intelligence officer, the most important thing is—"

"To conceal oneself, Sir." He accepted the teacup, "By the way, there have been a lot more patrol teams on the streets recently, and even the number of guards on the city walls has doubled. Could it be... that these movements are related to His Highness's orders?"

"Indeed, Timothy—"



Tasha had only gotten halfway through her sentence when a sudden peal of thunder, like a dry-land explosion, rolled over the mansion, the sound so loud it made the window glass tremble. At the same time, the ground shook slightly, the tremor brief but distinct. Caught off guard, Hill's teacup fell straight to the ground, shattering into several pieces.

"I'm sorry, my lord... But," Hill stammered, "what on earth was that?"

"Come with me." Tasha's expression was serious.

They rushed out of the garden residence and were immediately drawn to a column of black smoke in the direction of the palace. Clearly, the thunderous noise had originated from there. Having witnessed His Highness's cannons and firearms, he naturally knew that only alchemical powder could produce such a wrathful sound. Moreover, the intense shaking didn't seem like it could be caused by cannon fire; it was more reminiscent of the explosive packs originally used against the demonic beasts with thick armor.

Hill's mouth hung open, hardly believing his own eyes, "Could it be that His Highness's declaration in the warning was true?"

"Yes," Tasha finally relaxed, turning around with a look of feigned profundity, "This is also the new order His Highness wishes to entrust to you."

...

Timothy's face was ashen as he stared at the chandelier that had fallen in front of him, speechless for a long moment.

"Your Majesty, cough cough... Your Majesty, are you alright?" The Prime Minister coughed amidst the rising dust, "What on earth is happening outside?"



Timothy did not reply, only feeling a severe dryness in his throat. Underneath the chandelier was a silver-armored knight who had been reporting on the recruitment of refugees and was now crushed to death by the falling chandelier. If he had taken one more step forward, he might have...



Just thinking about it made him break out in goosebumps.



"Is this an earthquake?" the Minister of Finance said, still shaken, "We must leave the castle quickly and go to an open area."



"That's right, Your Majesty, this place isn't safe!"



"Silence!" Timothy shouted, his voice hoarse as if someone was squeezing his throat, "Sir Weimas, take me to the basement immediately!"



"Yes, Your Majesty." The Steelheart Knight, though looking somewhat nervous, was considerably more composed than the other high officials, as he came over to help Timothy and headed downstairs.



On the way, the new king saw the hallway littered with broken glass, and through the damaged windows, he saw that the grand Cathedral of the Sky on one side of the castle was no more. Among the rising dust, the majestic structure was now reduced to a few lonely columns. This was not the work of an earthquake, but the result of a massive gunpowder explosion!



Leaving the castle now would be suicide. Who knew if Roland Wimbledon had planted gunpowder elsewhere? Only the underground chamber, fortified with thick stone walls, could offer sufficient safety.



Damn it, Timothy thought bitterly, why did his fourth brother also possess such alchemical weapons? Could it be that Grace had given him the formula when she left Clearwater Harbor, allowing him to use gunpowder to fight him to a mutual downfall?



Even so, how did he manage to bury the Chill Powder within the palace? Even a witch with extraordinary abilities couldn't possibly do this!



"Take the Knight Order and thoroughly search the entire palace area, especially the sewers, gardens, and warehouses where the Chill Powder might be hidden!" As soon as he stepped into the basement, Timothy immediately ordered the Steelheart Knights, "Arrest anyone suspicious, whether noble or not, and scrutinize every servant and maid entering and leaving the palace—not a single one should be overlooked!"



"By your command, Your Majesty."



After Sir Weimar left, the new king realized his back was soaked with cold sweat.



Roland actually managed to do this!



Regardless of how he did it, if he could hide the Chill Powder in the palace this time, wouldn't it be just as easy for him to place it in the castle next time?



"The position you are in is far less secure than you imagine. When the time comes, everyone will see that your throne is already teetering." 



Thinking of this warning, Timothy couldn't help but shudder.



As his anger gradually subsided, he felt fear rising from the soles of his feet, slowly clenching his heart.
