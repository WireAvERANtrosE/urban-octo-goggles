## Fear
Theo had been in contact with His Highness the Prince once a day for the past few days.

Despite having witnessed many inconceivable events during his year as a personal guard to His Highness, the new orders still struck him as unbelievable and... confusing.

Paint the assault on the palace in the capital as a punishment from Roland Wimbledon to Timothy Wimbledon?

When the militia that had attacked the Western Territory was routed and returned to the capital, Theo had heard about the "warning" carried by these people. He originally thought that it was just a bluff by His Highness, or a strategy to distract attention—while Timothy was focused on vigilance and defense, His Highness would attack other cities. It was similar to what Grace had done, looting her opponents before the onset of winter.

However, the subsequent orders from Border Town made him feel that something was amiss; His Highness seemed to really be planning an attack on the capital and asked him to prepare for the propaganda. The latest order explicitly informed that the attack would be launched on the first day of mid-autumn, exactly the same time as notified in the "warning."

Look at this phrase, "paint the assault on the palace in the capital as a punishment." That is to say, His Highness intends to directly attack the inner city district of the capital—but how is that possible? The capital has the strongest walls in all of Greycastle, thick enough to accommodate two houses side by side, and not even His Highness's cannons could destroy them. In addition to the Knights of the capital, the personal guard, and the conscripted militia, it would be very difficult to invade the city without an army of over ten thousand men.

Launching a surprise attack with witches is equally fanciful; there are as many God's Punishment Stones in the palace as there are hairs on a cow, and massive God's Punishment Stones have been installed in places like the great hall and the sleeping chambers. The moment witches step into a room, they would be stripped of all their powers. This is also why Timothy has been able to kill witches en masse without retaliation—assassinating a royal noble within the palace is simply impossible.

Moreover, there is a hidden danger to this method. If Timothy Wimbledon were to die at the hands of a witch, the Church would likely benefit the most... With a little guidance, it would be easy to confirm the accusation that the fourth prince attempted to usurp the throne with the help of devil’s minions, and the nobles would also unite to resist his power. But with the intelligence of Prince Roland, Theo believed that he must be able to see this point.

So, how exactly does His Highness plan to attack the inner city district?



"Sir, what are your orders for me?" Hill Fawx pushed open the half-closed door and walked into the living room.

"Wait for a new command," Theo spread his hands, "Take a seat first."

"...Yes."

Seeing the former circus troupe member's face full of surprise, he could only smile helplessly. Normally, he would receive clear orders before notifying these people, but this time it was not convenient for him to reveal the task entrusted by His Highness in advance—if the King's City palace was not attacked, such seemingly absurd instructions could easily diminish the other party's trust.

On the contrary, if His Highness really achieved this, it would undoubtedly be an unprecedented shock for them, and it would greatly boost the confidence of this group of people—especially witnessing with their own eyes that His Highness could pose a real threat to Timothy's kingship from thousands of miles away. Such propaganda effect would be more effective than exhausting all his eloquence.

Therefore, Theo chose a middle course, calling Hill Fawx to the inner city area to wait for His Highness to fulfill his warning. If successful, naturally, everyone would be overjoyed; if it failed, he could simply claim that the messenger might have been delayed on the road.

"Have some tea," Theo smiled, "Don't always carry your questions on your face. As an intelligence officer, the most important thing is—"

"To conceal oneself, Sir." He took the teacup, "By the way, there have been a lot more patrol teams on the streets recently, and even the guards on the city walls have doubled. Could it be... do all these movements have something to do with His Highness's orders?"

"Indeed, Timothy—"



Theo had only gotten halfway through his sentence when a clap of thunder, as sudden as if it had come from a dry sky, rolled over the mansion, the sound so loud it made the windowpanes tremble. At the same time, the ground shook slightly, the tremor brief yet distinct. Hill, caught off guard, dropped the teacup in his hand straight to the floor, shattering it into several pieces.



"Sorry, my lord... But," Hill stammered, wide-eyed, "what is going on?"



"Come with me," said Theo with a serious look.



The two rushed out of the garden residence and were immediately drawn to a column of black smoke rising in the direction of the royal palace. Clearly, the thunderous sound had come from there. Having seen His Highness's cannons and firearms, he naturally knew that only alchemical powder could produce such a thunderous clamor, and moreover, the intense shaking didn't seem like it was caused by cannon fire, but rather it was more like the explosive packages originally used against the Demonic Beasts with thick armor.



Hill's mouth hung open, hardly able to believe his own eyes, "Could it be that His Highness's declaration in the warning was true?"



"That's right," Theo finally relaxed, turning around with a deliberately profound air, "This is also the new order that His Highness wants to give you."



...

Timothy's face was ashen as he stared at the chandelier falling before him, speechless for a long while.



"Your Majesty, cough cough... Your Majesty, are you alright?" The Prime Minister coughed in the midst of the swirling dust, "Damn it, what on earth is happening outside?"



Timothy did not answer, only feeling an intense dryness in his throat. Underneath the chandelier, a silver-armored knight was pressing down, who had been reporting to him about the recruitment of refugees, but now his neck was broken by the fallen chandelier. If he had taken one more step forward, perhaps he would have…



The thought made his hair stand on end.



"Is this an earthquake?" the Minister of Finance said, still in shock, "We need to leave the castle quickly and go to an open area."



"That's right, Your Majesty, it's not safe here!"



"Shut up!" Timothy roared, and it was only when he spoke that he realized how hoarse his voice was, as if someone was choking him, "Sir Weimar, take me to the basement immediately!"



"Yes, Your Majesty." Although the Steelheart Knight looked somewhat nervous, he was considerably more composed compared to the other high officials. He came over to help Timothy and headed downstairs.



Along the way, the new king saw the corridor was littered with broken glass. Through the damaged windows, he saw that the Halos Hall on the side of the castle was no longer there. Amidst the rising dust, the magnificent building was now reduced to a few solitary stone pillars. This could not have been caused by an earthquake, but only by a massive gunpowder explosion!



Leaving the castle now would undoubtedly be courting death. Who knows if Roland Wimbledon had planted gunpowder elsewhere? Only the underground cellar, built with thick stone walls, would be safe enough.



Damn it, Timothy thought bitterly. Why would his fourth brother also possess such alchemical weapons? Could it be that Grace had given him the formula when she left Clearwater Harbor, allowing him to use gunpowder to fight to the death with him!



However, even so, how did he manage to get the gunpowder into the palace? Even a witch with extraordinary powers couldn't possibly achieve this!



"Take the Knights of the Steel Heart and conduct a thorough search of the entire palace area, especially the sewers, gardens, and warehouses where gunpowder can be easily hidden!" As soon as he stepped into the basement, Timothy immediately ordered the Steel Heart Knight, "Capture any suspicious individuals, noble or not, and thoroughly search all the servants and maids entering and leaving the palace. Don't let a single one go!"



"As you command, Your Majesty."



After Sir Weimar left, the new king realized that his back was soaked with cold sweat.



Roland actually did it!



Regardless of how he did it, if he could hide the gunpowder in the palace this time, wouldn't it be just as easy for him to place it in the castle next time?



"The position you are in is far from as safe as you imagine. When the time comes, everyone will see that your throne is already teetering." 



Remembering this warning, Timothy couldn't help but shiver.



As his anger gradually subsided, he felt fear rising from the soles of his feet, slowly gripping his heart.
