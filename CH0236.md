## Chemical Accident
When Roland arrived at the laboratory by the Redwater River, he found the damage was not as severe as he had imagined. At least the main room used for acid refining was intact, and only two panes of glass in the side room were shattered by the shock.



"My lord, please save our mentor! He's badly injured and he's not going to make it."



Upon seeing Roland, a group of disciples immediately surrounded him, but they were quickly stopped by the guards. Roland waved his hand to calm everyone, "Where is he? Let me see him first." Then he turned his head and asked Carter in a low voice, "Where is Nana?"



"I've already sent someone to fetch her, she should be here soon."



"Good."



Roland nodded and entered the laboratory under the protection of his guards.



Kamol Stry was lying on the ground, with spots of blood leading to the side room, probably dragged from the site of the accident into the main house. His face was a blur, covered in blood and pus, likely caused by the strong acid splashed during the explosion. Several fingers were missing from his hands, revealing white bones through the flesh.



The apprentices had already administered first aid, and it was evident that they had encountered similar situations while in Redwater City. They had taken measures such as moving the injured away from danger, binding wounds to stop bleeding, and seeking help—all of which were quite adequate. However, with injuries like these, if one were to rely on herbs and self-healing, there was a very high chance he would not have been saved.



Roland instructed the guards to secure the door and wait for Nana's arrival, while he and Carter went into the side room to retrieve the Chief Alchemist's fingers. Otherwise, even if the young girl healed his wounds, he would no longer be able to conduct chemical experiments—an absolute loss for Border Town.



"It's like it's been swept by a gale," Carter said, pinching his nose, "and there's also a strange, unpleasant smell."

"That's the smell of nitrogen dioxide," Roland said as he scanned the small room. All the windows had been opened, so the possibility of poisoning was slim, at most it would be just some residue left behind. Glass bottles on the experiment table were shattered, their acidic contents having spilled over the tabletop and pooled into stains on the floor.

"Remember to use tools when searching through this mess, don't touch them directly with your hands," the prince instructed, "There are gloves in the cabinet."

Since Soraya's ability evolved, he had sent over a dozen pairs of thin, anti-corrosion gloves to the laboratory. However, seeing the alchemist's current predicament, it was clear that he had conducted his experiments without wearing the gloves. If he had been wearing them, even if the explosion had blown off his fingers, at least they would have been contained inside the gloves.

Something caught Roland's attention in the storage cabinet above the experiment table. He took down a strangely shaped bottle and realized it was actually the liquor sold in the convenience market—and a good portion of it had been drunk, leaving only about half a bottle.

Could it be that Kajen actually brought liquor into the laboratory? It was hard to imagine an experienced chief alchemist drinking while conducting experiments!

"Your Highness, Miss Nana has arrived," the guard reported.

"Mhm, continue to guard the door and don't let any apprentices in." Leaving Carter to continue searching for the severed fingers among the glass debris, Roland went back to the main room of the laboratory.

"Is this the one?" For Nana, this level of treatment was routine, a far cry from the girl who used to be so scared of blood that she'd faint at the sight of a gruesome wound. Now she had grown a lot—both in ability and courage.



"First, heal the corrosive wound on his face," Roland nodded, "Carter is looking for his severed fingers. You can attach them later."

"No need," Nana smiled proudly, "I can heal such minor injuries directly now."

Roland was startled, watching as she placed her hands above the alchemist's chest, closed her eyes, and immediately, Camilla's injuries began to change—his face healed in moments, and even his severed fingers began to grow back, although much more slowly. First the bone, then the flesh, and finally the nails and hair. It took about a quarter of an hour for his fingers to fully return to their original state.

Just then, Carter walked out from the side room, "Your Highness, I only found three fingers, the other one might have been blown to pieces—eh?"

"When did you become able to do this?" Roland asked in surprise.

"About a week ago, I found out during training with a chick that I don't need the severed limb; as long as I inject enough magic power, it can slowly grow back." She stuck out her tongue, "I guess it's because I remembered what you said—every part of the human body is made up of cells, and there would definitely be cell loss where it's severed. Since magic can make up for these losses, why not regenerate the entire limb? So, I tried doing just that."

"Can any part grow back?"

Nana shook her head, "This method is too exhausting. I can manage a finger, but if it's an arm or a shin, I can't do it. After all, the magic power I can hold is far less than Sister Anna's."

That's because you're still underage, Roland thought to himself. Moreover, is this an evolution of her ability, or is it due to training that her current magic is sufficient to achieve what was previously impossible? Without Nightingale, it was impossible to determine if Nana's magic had undergone any changes in form. If it was simply due to an increase in magic power, the girl's performance after reaching adulthood would definitely be something to look forward to.



"Your Highness, he's awake," Carter spoke up.

"Where am I... What happened?" Kyle Sichi furrowed his brow, first examining his unharmed hands and then touching his face, "Shouldn't I be—"

"You were supposed to die from severe injuries in a chemical accident, but a witch saved your life. This lady beside me is the one who treated you, Miss Nana Pine," Roland decided to tell the Chief Alchemist about Nana's identity upfront. A person who would rush to Border Town for the sake of a chemical reaction formula shouldn't be a stubborn person. Even if he harbored aversion toward witches in his heart, he wouldn't likely abandon his work to report to the church. Besides, with Lucia now in town, collaboration between alchemists and witches was inevitable.

"My goodness, are you saying this witch can heal injuries caused by alchemy—no, chemical experiments?" Kyle Sichi reacted in a completely different way than expected, "Hahaha, that's excellent, Your Highness! With this, I can test reactions to my heart's content without worrying about the dangers!"

"So what exactly happened?" Roland breathed a sigh of relief internally, "How did you bring spirits into the laboratory?"

"No, Your Highness, that was just for the experiment," the Chief Alchemist said excitedly, "I've succeeded in what you asked me to try and make!"

"You mean... mercury fulminate?"

"Yes, Your Highness! It turns out that the missing reactant was alcohol!" He spoke in one breath, "I had tried dozens of materials before without any progress. It was when I was feeling frustrated and went to the market to buy some drinks, I suddenly remembered that 'Elementary Chemistry' mentioned alcohol as an organic solvent, which is also necessary for some reactions. So I distilled the spirits to purify it as a new reagent for testing, and it worked on the sixth attempt... There was a gray crystalline precipitate in several test tubes. I even recorded the heating time and reaction temperature at that time, and did some tests on some of it. The properties were just as you described—grayish-white needle-like crystals or powder, extremely sensitive and volatile. Just when I was about to filter out the precipitate from the remaining test tubes, one of them suddenly exploded."

So that's how it was, Roland also recalled at this moment, mercury fulminate is produced by mixing excess nitric acid with mercury and ethanol, or by reacting mercuric nitrate directly with ethanol.



"Well done," he patted Carter Lannis on the shoulder, "This achievement is enough for you to receive the highest honor and a generous reward in Border Town."

With this, the development of the center-fire fixed ammunition finally made progress.
