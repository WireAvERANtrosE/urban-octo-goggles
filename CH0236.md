## Chemical accident
When Roland arrived at the laboratory beside the Redwater River, he found that the damage was not as severe as he had imagined. At least the main room used for acid refining was completely intact, while two panes of window glass in the side room were shattered.



"My lord, please save our teacher! He's badly injured, and he's not going to make it," the disciples pleaded as they saw Roland appear, but they were quickly stopped by the guards. Roland waved his hand to calm them down, "Where is he? Let me see him first." Then he turned his head and asked Carter in a low voice, "Where is Nana?"



"I've already sent someone to fetch her, she should arrive soon."



"Mm."



Roland nodded and entered the laboratory under the protection of his guards.



Kyle Sichi was lying on the ground, with droplets of blood on the floor that trailed to the side room, likely dragged there from the site of the accident. His face was a mess, covered in a mix of blood and pus, likely from the strong acid that splashed on him during the explosion. Several of his fingers were missing, and white bones could be seen through the flesh.



The apprentices had already administered first aid, and it was evident that they had encountered similar situations in the city of Redwater before. They had carried out all the appropriate measures: moving the injured away from danger, bandaging to stop the bleeding, seeking help... However, with such injuries, if they had been treated in the usual way with herbs and self-healing, there would have been little hope of survival.



Roland ordered his guards to secure the entrance and wait for Nana's arrival, while he and Carter entered the side room, hoping to recover the chief alchemist's fingers. Otherwise, even if the young girl healed his wounds, he would no longer be able to conduct chemical experiments—a definite major loss for Border Town.



"It's like it's been swept by a gale," Carter pinched his nose and said, "and there's a strange, unpleasant smell."

"That's the smell of nitrogen dioxide," Roland surveyed the small room. The windows were all open, so the possibility of poisoning was slim, at most there were only some remnants left. The glass bottles on the experimental table were shattered across it, acid water flowed down the table surface, pooling into stains on the floor.

"Remember to use tools when you search through the debris, don't touch them directly with your hands," the prince cautioned, "there are gloves in the cabinet."

Ever since Soraya's ability had evolved, he had also brought over a dozen pairs of ultra-thin, corrosion-resistant gloves to the laboratory. However, seeing the alchemist's current sorry state, it was clear that the experiments had been conducted without wearing gloves. If gloves had been worn, even if the explosion had blown off his fingers, at least the fingers would have remained inside them.

In the storage cabinet above the experimental table, something caught Roland's attention. He took down the oddly shaped bottle and found that it was actually the liquor sold in the convenience market—and a good amount of the liquor had been drunk, leaving only less than half a bottle.

Kyle actually brought liquor into the laboratory? It was hard to imagine that an experienced Chief Alchemist would drink while conducting experiments!

"Your Highness, Miss Nana has arrived," the guard reported.

"Mhm, continue to guard the door and don't let the apprentices in." Leaving Carter to continue searching through the glass debris for the severed fingers, Roland went back to the main laboratory room first.

"Is this the one?" For Nana, this level of treatment was routine. Compared to the little girl who used to be scared of blood and would faint at the sight of gruesome wounds, she had grown a lot—both in ability and in courage.



"First, heal the corrosive wounds on his face," Roland nodded, "Carter is looking for his severed fingers. You can reattach them later."

"No need," Nana said with a proud smile, "I can heal such minor injuries directly now."

Roland was taken aback as he watched her place her hands above the alchemist's chest and close her eyes. Kyle's injuries began to change immediately—his face healed in no time, and even the severed fingers started to grow back, albeit much more slowly. First the bones, then the flesh, and lastly the fingernails and hair. It took about a quarter of an hour for his fingers to be fully restored.

Just then, Carter walked out from the side room, "Your Highness, I found only three fingers. The fourth might have been blown to pieces—eh?"

"When did you become capable of doing this?" Roland asked in surprise.

"About a week ago. I discovered while practicing with chicks that if I pour enough magic power, even without the severed limbs, they can still grow back slowly," she said, sticking out her tongue. "I guess I was inspired by what you said—every part of the human body is made up of cells, and where there's a break, there must be cell loss. Since magic power can make up for these losses, why can't it restore the entire limb? So I tried doing just that."

"Can it grow any part?"

Nana shook her head, "This method is too exhausting. It works for a finger, but if it's an arm or a lower leg, I can't do it. After all, I can't hold as much magic power as Sister Anna."

That's because you're still underage, Roland thought to himself. Besides, is this a manifestation of her abilities evolving, or is it due to training that her current magic power can achieve what was previously impossible? Without Nightingale, it was impossible to tell if there had been a change in the form of Nana's magic power. If it was simply due to an increase in magic power, then the young girl's performance upon reaching adulthood would certainly be something to look forward to.



"Your Highness, he's awake," Carter spoke up.

"Where am I... What happened?" Kyle furrowed his brow, first looking at his intact hands, then touched his face, "Shouldn't I have—"

"Been gravely injured in a chemical accident, yes, but a witch saved your life. This lady by my side is the one who treated you, Miss Nana Pine," Roland decided to tell the Chief Alchemist about Nana's identity directly. A person willing to travel to Border Town for a chemical reaction formula should not be a stubborn conservative, and even if he disliked witches in his heart, he would not abandon his work to report to the Church. Besides, with Lucia now in town, collaboration between alchemists and witches was only a matter of time.

"My goodness, are you saying that this witch can heal injuries caused by alchemical—no, chemical experiments?" Kyle's reaction was utterly different from what he had expected, "Hahaha, this is wonderful, Your Highness! Now I can test reactions without worrying about the dangers!"

"So what exactly happened?" Roland breathed a sigh of relief internally, "How did you even bring liquor into the laboratory?"

"No, Your Highness, that was just for the experiment," the Chief Alchemist said excitedly, "The thing you asked me to try and produce, I've made it!"

"Do you mean... mercury fulminate?"

"Yes, Your Highness! The missing reactant was alcohol!" He said in one breath, "Before this, I had tried dozens of materials without any progress. I was so frustrated that I went to the market for some drinks and then it suddenly occurred to me. Elementary Chemistry mentioned that alcohol is an organic solvent, and it is also a necessary reactant for some processes. So, I distilled the liquor to purify it and used it as a new reagent for testing, and on the sixth attempt, it was successful... gray crystalline precipitates appeared in several test tubes. I even recorded the heating time and reaction temperature at the time and took some out for testing. The properties were just as you described—grayish-white needle-like crystals or powder, highly sensitive and volatile. Just when I wanted to filter out the precipitates from the remaining test tubes, one of the tubes suddenly exploded."

That explains it, Roland recalled at that moment, mercury fulminate is produced by mixing an excess of nitric acid with mercury and ethanol, or by reacting mercury nitrate directly with ethanol.



"Well done," he patted Kyle Sichi's shoulder, "This achievement is enough for you to receive the highest honor and a generous reward from Border Town."

With this, the fixed cartridge with impact ignition finally had a promising lead.
