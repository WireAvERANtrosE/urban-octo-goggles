## Signs of the Ocean
"Hey, girls, fancy a bowl of fish soup?" Captain Jack poked his head into the cabin, his pipe cocked up at the corner of his mouth, "A lucky fellow just caught a big tailless trout."



"Thank you," Tilly Wimbledon nodded, "We'll be right there."



"Fish soup again," Ashes sighed after the captain left, "What's so good about this bland and fishy thing?"



"You can add more salt to the bowl," suggested Wendy with a light laugh, "Pepper works too, but it's quite expensive, I'm afraid Mr. Jack might not be willing to spare you some."



"Without adding anything, the soup tastes closer to the original flavor, and it also tests the quality of the food itself," Andrea elegantly straightened her pale golden hair, "Lady Tilly, let's go to the captain's cabin."



"As long as it's hot, I'm fine," the shortest of them, Soraya, muttered, "My toes are almost frozen stiff."



The group ascended the stairs from the bottom of the 'Resplendent' and onto the stern deck where Jack 'One-Eye' stood by the porthole, watching the white wake rolling and spreading out behind the ship.



"This damned weather, how did it suddenly get so cold?" he exhaled a ring of smoke, "By the Three Gods, it's only mid-autumn now."



"Maybe the deities fell asleep?" shrugged Ashes.



"Pah pah, you can't say such things at sea," Captain Jack grinned, "The Sea God is always watching over us," he made a blessing gesture over his chest, "Forget it, let's not think about it. Let's have a bowl of fish soup to warm up the belly first."



In order to enjoy warm food in the captain's cabin, he did not hesitate to cut a large hole in the floor, setting up a brazier in the center of the hole, surrounded by sea sand to insulate and prevent the whole ship from catching fire.



A large pot of fish soup was bubbling and boiling on the brazier, making a gurgling sound, and the aroma filled the entire room.



The six of them took off their shoes and sat around the brazier, burying their feet in the warm fine sand, letting their icy toes fully contact the grains, enjoying the warmth brought by the charcoal fire.



Tilly took the fish soup passed by the captain and gently blew on the steaming surface—unlike the creamy white soup made with blacktail fish, this bowl had a deep yellow color with oil spots floating on top, reflecting a crystal-like luster.



Seeing the occasional bits of green and white floating in the soup, she knew the old captain had taken out the goods from the bottom of the chest—sea voyages that lasted for several months made it difficult for the crew to eat fresh vegetables and fruits. These tender green onions were obviously preserved by him with special care using saltpeter, their fragrance neutralized the fishy smell of the flesh. Combined with slices of ginger and a bit of barley beer, what remained was a rich and thick deliciousness.



Tilly slowly drank the fish soup, pausing for a moment whenever it was about to scald her tongue, exhaling a few breaths. With each small sip, she could clearly feel the soup acting like a warm current, flowing down her throat all the way to her stomach, turning it warm and toasty.



The chill quickly faded away, and she even felt her body warming up slightly.



"Try adding some chili pepper," Jack pointed to a clay jar next to the brazier filled with spices, "It'll make the flavor even more special, and it's great for driving away the cold, even more effective than alcohol."



"Although the essence of food is its original flavor, I must say, these few ingredients added are just right, and the taste is not lacking at all," Andrea praised.



"Aren't you drinking?" Tilly looked at Ashes.



The latter waved her hand, "Better not, I really can't stand the fishy smell of seafood."



Initially, Tilly also couldn't accept the bay people's love for eating fish—a meal was never complete without a variety of fish dishes, let alone the standard grilling, boiling, frying, and then there were peculiar methods like fish jelly, fish sauce, and caviar... However, after forcing herself to eat it a few times at official banquets, she found that the taste was actually quite good. Once accustomed to the sea's fishy smell, it could even further enhance the food's own deliciousness. Like dried fish, grilled squid, and even stinky fish fried in oil, which smelled pungent, she was now willing to try slowly.



"Our 'Miss Ashes' has been spoiled by the barbaric cooking methods of Border Town," Andrea covered her mouth and said, "What a pity, being accustomed to spices and fine salt not only made her lose the ability to discern deliciousness, it seems her courage is also dwindling."



"What did you say?" Ashes glared at her.



"What, isn't it true?" Andrea let out a string of laughter, "Just a bit of fishiness and you shy away from it, acting capriciously like a little girl. How can you be expected to stand up for Lady Tilly when she needs you?"



"So that's how it is... It seems you really want to provoke a fight with me," Ashes's tone suddenly became calm, "Give it up, there is a terrifying weapon in Border Town, much more formidable than your arrows. Even so, I still won the contest. So if you want to take away the position of Lady Tilly's personal guard from me, you'll need to practice a few more years..." She paused, "Maybe even a lifetime."



"You—"



Ashes curled up the corner of her mouth, "Besides, the delicacies invented by Prince Roland are not just a combination of spices and refined salt. You will understand once you taste them. Just remember not to let any saliva drip onto your clothes; Lady Tilly cannot afford to lose that face."

"Nonsense, that's more like you!"

Tilly couldn't help but laugh aloud. These two were the strongest witches on Sleeping Island, and they often quarreled over "who is the strongest," but she knew that whether it was Ashes or Andrea, they were her best subordinates. When danger approached, they would undoubtedly fight side by side without hesitation, forming an impregnable wall for Sleeping Island.

The argument between the two made the room's atmosphere lively. Seeing this scene, Tilly involuntarily thought of the five witches sent to Border Town. She wondered how they were doing in her brother's territory.

Just then, the Seagull suddenly shook violently without warning.

"Be careful!" Ashes pulled the fifth princess away, as the iron pot from the brazier was overturned, the soup extinguished the charcoal, and fish was scattered all over the floor.

Then, a sharp whistle sounded from outside the cabin.

"We are under attack! Enemy attack!"

A sailor rushed into the captain's cabin, his face filled with horror as he shouted, "Captain, sea devils are coming! And not just one!"



Sea Devils... aren't those another name for demonic beasts? Tilly was momentarily stunned. How did they end up here?



The group ran out of the stern cabin, only to see the deck overrun with more than a dozen fish-bodied, crab-legged monsters, with more climbing aboard the Beauty of the Sea from both sides of the ship. They moved swiftly, their six legs scuttling like those of a giant cockroach; the human-like arms flailing beside their heads were alarmingly strong, capable of twisting a sailor's neck with sheer force.



"Since you're unwilling to fight, let's have a contest," Andrea snapped her fingers, and a golden light emerged from between them, forming a bow that she firmly grasped in her hand, "Whoever kills more monsters is the most formidable one."



"It doesn't matter," Ashes said, pulling out the oddly-shaped greatsword from her back, "I'm going in."
