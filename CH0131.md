## The Manifestation of Magic Power
As dawn broke, Roland was dragged out of bed by Nightingale—He remembered the last time this happened was when Nana was discovered to be a witch by Titus Pine.

"What's the matter? Has a new witch been found in town?" he asked, rubbing his eyes.

"No, Your Highness!" Nightingale exclaimed excitedly, "Anna... Anna's abilities have changed again!"

"Again?" Roland was still not fully awake, "Hasn't she already come of age?"

"It's a change that happened after she came of age, I've never seen such an astonishing form of magic power, it's almost like a solid entity," Nightingale brought over a basin to wash his face, "Scroll and Wendy have also never heard of such a thing, you must come and see, everyone is waiting for you in the office!"

Roland washed his face hastily, got dressed, and followed Nightingale to the second floor. As he entered the office, the gazes of eleven witches immediately focused on him. Anna's eyes were somewhat swollen, as if she hadn't slept well the entire night.

"Can someone tell me what exactly happened?"

Nightingale was the first to speak, "This morning when I passed by Anna's room, I saw her lying on the desk asleep, with a bunch of iron lumps on it. I was about to wake her when I got closer and realized that the magic power inside her had become..." she paused for a moment, seemingly searching for the right words, "it had taken a fixed shape, like a constantly rotating cube."

"A cube?" Roland approached Anna and examined her carefully—apart from appearing a bit tired, she didn't look any different. Then he noticed a cylindrical object on the desk, seemingly made of pig iron, with a grayish-white smooth surface and a neatly cut top that made him think his eyes were deceiving him, "Is this..."



"It was made by Anna," Nightingale said, "using her new ability. After a witch awakens, magic power begins to gather inside her body. At first, it's as thin as mist, but after a few years, it slowly turns into a swirling vortex of various colors. For example, Wendy's is white, and Leaf's is green... Anna's magic power was very vast before, and after she became an adult, it condensed quite a bit, turning dark green. But now, the magic power inside her is only the size of a fist, just like a solid, completely opaque." She picked up a quill from the desk and sketched roughly, "It's about like this."



Although Nightingale's drawing skills were quite poor, Roland could still make out that it was a cube.



He looked towards Anna, "What happened last night?"



Anna recounted her experience. When she finished, the other witches still wore a blank expression, completely failing to understand the relationship between the little sphere, vibrations, connections, and the change in abilities that she described.



Only Roland had a slight movement in his heart.



In his conception, magic power was a form of energy, and witches were the terminals that released it. The effects that magic power could transform into were endless, but which specific effect it would ultimately take shape as depended on the witch manipulating it, or to put it a step further, depended on the witch's thoughts.



If his guess was not wrong, thoughts could have a profound influence on abilities.



Simply put, a person who had never seen an airplane would hardly think that a huge iron bird could fly in the sky; a person who had never witnessed the universe naturally wouldn't know how vast this world is. The height of one's thoughts and the breadth of one's knowledge limit one's use of magic power—the deeper the understanding of the world's essence, the more significant the technological progress. So, wouldn't it be the same for a witch's abilities? The deeper the understanding of the world, the closer the effect of magic power to its origin?



"Let me see your new ability," Roland said, curious.



Anna extended her finger, and a bundle of black flame appeared out of thin air at her fingertip. It looked no different from an ordinary flame in shape, except that it didn't emit light.



"Can your black fire change shape at will?"



Anna nodded and directed it to float down onto the tabletop. Quickly, the naturally-shaped black flame suddenly transformed into a cube. Before everyone could react, the cube spread out into a sheet of black cloth, covering nearly the entire tabletop. Then, it gathered towards the center, gradually forming a straight line standing on end. Roland couldn't help but reach out to touch it and found that the hair-thin black line didn't budge—an incredible feat, considering that even steel, which is very hard, can easily be bent with fingers when drawn into a thin wire. This was determined by the flexibility of the material; an absolutely rigid body does not exist.



"Can it be even thinner?"



"Yes, but if it were, you wouldn't be able to touch it anymore," Anna said. "Otherwise, it would cut you."



"What about the temperature? Can you control that at will, too?"



"Mm-hmm, and compared to the green fire, I can make it produce different temperatures at different parts."



Roland began to understand what Nightingale meant by saying it was like a tangible reality. Compared to the warm, water-like green fire, her current ability had solidified into form, and it wasn't quite right to describe it as merely flame—after Anna had accepted the viewpoint that everything in the world is composed of microscopic particles, her understanding of how flames produce heat also broke through to the new stage of particle movement generating temperature. It was certain that she was not manipulating particles, just as she was not manipulating flames before... Whether it was the seemingly ordinary flames at first, or the green fire and black flame of later years, they were all manifestations of magical power.



Although both converted magical power into heat, the effects were entirely different.



A true genius, Roland couldn't help but sigh. Apart from genius, he couldn't think of a more appropriate adjective. After learning new knowledge that very night, being able to comprehend and apply it to her abilities immediately, such a way of thinking and absorption capability could only belong to someone with exceptional talent.



Anna's change also made him even more interested in exploring the true essence of this world.



Unfortunately, he himself could not possess magical power, Roland thought. This might be the greatest regret after crossing over. After all, most people harbor the dream of a superhero in their hearts, unexpectedly obtaining incredible powers and embarking on a unique path is such a thrilling thing.



"I think I know the reason for the change in Anna's abilities," he put aside the regrets in his heart and said to the witches.



"What is it?" The crowd asked in unison.



"Learning."



"Learning?" Scroll murmured, "Are you talking about the teaching lesson from yesterday?"



"Exactly," Roland succinctly explained his conjecture, "Exposure to knowledge helps you improve your abilities, even resulting in a drastic change."



"Can I... also do it?" Nightingale asked timidly.



"Of course." Roland patted her shoulder. If it wasn't for the limited number of steam engines and the inability to find rubber to make electrical wires, the pile of strong magnets she enchanted would probably have been put to use a long time ago.

Originally, Roland's intention of teaching was just to pass on the knowledge he had learned to Scroll, to avoid forgetting more and more himself. Now, he unexpectedly found that learning could also amplify abilities, making it very necessary to teach all the witches together.

Of course, he also understood that not everyone possessed Anna's exceptional talent. For someone like Nightingale, who could fall asleep during lessons, he had no expectations. From memorization to understanding, and then from understanding to application, there were countless hurdles in between. How many people could ultimately apply the knowledge they comprehended to their abilities was something he didn't know.

"You didn't sleep well last night, did you?" Roland said to Anna. "Go and catch up on some sleep later. In a couple of days, I'll properly test your new ability."

"Mhm." Anna nodded earnestly.

"As for you all," he looked towards the other witches, "starting from today, gather in the parlor every Monday to Friday after dinner, starting from the most basic reading and writing. Scroll, you will be their elementary teacher."
