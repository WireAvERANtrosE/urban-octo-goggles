## The Manifestation of Magic Power
As dawn broke, Roland was pulled out of bed by Nightingale— the last time this happened was when Nana was discovered to be a witch by Titus Pine.
"What's the matter? Has a new witch been found in town?" he asked, rubbing his eyes.
"No, Your Highness!" Nightingale exclaimed excitedly, "Anna... Anna's abilities have changed again!"
"Again?" Roland was still not fully awake, "Hasn't she already come of age?"
"It's a change that occurred after reaching adulthood. I've never seen such an astonishing form of magic power, it's almost like a solid entity," Nightingale brought over a washbasin, "Scroll and Wendy have never heard of such a thing either. You must come and see, everyone is waiting for you in the office!"
Roland washed his face hastily, donned his clothes, and followed Nightingale to the second floor. Entering the office, the gaze of eleven witches immediately fell upon him. Anna's eyes were somewhat swollen, as if she hadn't slept well all night.
"Can someone tell me what exactly happened?"
Nightingale was the first to speak up, "This morning, when I passed by Anna's room, I saw her sleeping at her desk with a bunch of iron lumps on it. I was about to go wake her up when I realized, closer up, that the magic power inside her had turned into..." she paused for a moment, seemingly searching for the right words, "it had taken on a fixed shape, like a constantly rotating cube."
"A cube?" Roland stepped in front of Anna and examined her carefully—aside from looking a bit tired, she seemed no different. Then he noticed a cylindrical object on the desk, apparently made of cast iron, with a grayish-white smooth surface and a cleanly cut top that made him think he was seeing things, "Is this…"

"It was made by Anna," Nightingale said, "using her new ability. After a witch awakens, magical power gathers within her body, initially thin like fog, but over a few years, it slowly transforms into a colorful gaseous vortex, like Wendy’s is white, Leaf’s is green... and Anna’s magical power used to be vast, condensed a lot when she became an adult, appearing dark green in color, but now, the magic inside her is only the size of a fist, solid like a substance, completely opaque." She picked up a quill from the desk and roughly sketched it out, "It's more or less like this."

Although Nightingale's drawing skills were quite poor, Roland could still make out that it was a cube.

He looked towards Anna, "What happened last night?"

Anna recounted her experiences. When she finished, the other witches still looked perplexed, completely failing to understand the correlation between the small sphere, vibrations, connections, and the change in abilities she described.

Only Roland felt a slight movement in his heart.

Magic, in his mind, was a form of energy, and witches were the terminals that released it. The effects that magic could transform into were endless, but the final outcome depended on the witch controlling it, or to put it further, on the witch's thoughts.

If his guess was correct, thoughts could have a profound influence on abilities.

Simply put, a person who has never seen an airplane would hardly imagine that a massive iron bird could fly in the sky; someone who has never witnessed space would naturally be unaware of how vast this world is. The height of one's thoughts and the breadth of knowledge limit the use of magical power—the deeper the understanding of the nature of the world, the greater the advancements in technology. So wouldn't it be the same for witches? The deeper their understanding of the world, the closer the effects of magic to its source?

"Let me see your new ability," Roland said curiously.

Anna extended her finger, and a clump of black flame appeared out of thin air at her fingertip. It looked no different from an ordinary flame, except that it did not emit light.

"Can your black fire change its shape at will?"

Anna nodded and directed it to drift onto the table surface. Soon, the naturally shaped black flame abruptly transformed into a cube. Before anyone could react, the cube spread out into a sheet of black cloth, nearly covering the entire table, and then it gathered towards the center, gradually becoming a straight line standing on end. Roland couldn't help but reach out to touch it, only to find that the thread-like black line was immovable—this was simply unbelievable, considering that even steel, when drawn into thin strands, could easily be bent with fingers. This was determined by the flexibility of the material; an absolute rigid body did not exist.

"Can you make it even finer?"

"I can, but then you won't be able to touch it anymore," Anna said. "Otherwise, it will cut you."

"What about the temperature? Can you control that at will too?"

"Yes, and I can make it produce different temperatures at different parts, which is more than I could do with the green fire."

Roland began to understand what Nightingale meant by 'tangible'. Compared to the warm, water-like green fire, her current ability had solidified into form. To describe it as a flame was not quite appropriate—after Anna accepted the view that everything in the world is composed of microscopic particles, her understanding of how fire generates heat also broke through to a new stage where temperature arises from particle movement. It was certain that she wasn't manipulating particles, much like she wasn't controlling actual flames before... Whether it was the initial flame that seemed ordinary, the green fire of her adulthood, or the black flame, they were all manifestations of magic power.

Although both converted magic power into heat, the effects were entirely different.

A true genius, Roland couldn't help but sigh. Apart from the word genius, he couldn't think of a more appropriate adjective. The ability to grasp and apply new knowledge immediately after learning it at night was a way of thinking and absorbing capacity that only the truly gifted could possess.

Anna's transformation also made him more interested in exploring the true essence of this world.

It's a pity that I can't have magical power, Roland thought. This might be the biggest regret after crossing over. After all, most people harbor the dream of being a superhero, gaining incredible power by chance, and embarking on a unique path, what a thrilling thing that would be.

"I think I know the reason for the change in Anna's abilities," he put away the regret in his heart and told the witches.

"What is it?" everyone asked in unison.

"Learning."

"Learning?" Scroll murmured, "Are you referring to yesterday's teaching lesson?"

"That's right," Roland briefly explained his conjecture, "Exposure to knowledge helps you improve your abilities, and might even lead to a dramatic change."

"Can I... do it too?" Miya asked timidly.

"Of course." Roland patted her shoulder. If it weren't for the limited number of steam engines and the inability to find rubber to make wires, the pile of strong magnets she enchanted would probably have been put to use already.
Originally, the purpose of Roland's classes was just to pass on the knowledge he had learned to Scrolls, to prevent himself from forgetting more and more. Now, unexpectedly discovering that studying knowledge could also amplify abilities, it had become very necessary to have all the witches attend classes together.
Of course, he also understood that not everyone had Anna's outstanding talent. For someone like Nightingale, who could fall asleep during a lecture, he had no expectations. From remembering to understanding, and then from understanding to application, there were countless hurdles in between. How many people would be able to apply the knowledge they comprehended to their abilities, he did not know.
"You didn't sleep well last night, did you?" Roland said to Anna, "Go and get some rest later. In a couple of days, I will properly test your new ability."
"Mhm." Anna nodded earnestly.
"As for you," he looked towards the other witches, "from today onwards, gather in the parlor after dinner every Monday to Friday, starting with the most basic reading and writing lessons. Scrolls, you will be their primer teacher."
