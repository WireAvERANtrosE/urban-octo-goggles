Scroll stood hesitating at the bedroom door for a moment before pushing it open.

Wendy was sitting at the desk with a troubled expression, holding a book in her hands. Without looking closely, one could guess that the book was certainly "The Basics of Natural Science Theory."

Scroll couldn't help but let out a light chuckle. She rarely saw such an expression on Wendy's face, even when the Witch Cooperation Association was trapped in dire straits amidst the mountains, and there was a shortage of supplies during those perilous times. Wendy still smiled and cheered for every sister, seemingly never worried about those hardships.

But now, a book had plunged her into distress.

"Can't understand it at all, right?" Scroll said. "I felt the same way when I first read a book."

"I thought it was Nightingale," Wendy turned her head upon hearing the voice, "…and how about now?"

"I still can't understand it."

"That's good; you're just like me." Wendy sighed, "Not to mention Anna, I didn't expect even Soraya to develop a new ability. I feel like I must work harder, or I'll be surpassed by the younger generation. I really don't understand how His Highness knows so much, able to describe the invisible world as if it were real."

"In fact, he doesn't know much either," Scroll shrugged, "at least in certain respects."



"Such as?"

"Such as the matter with Nightingale." She pulled out a stool and sat down beside Wendy, "Have you noticed that her behavior has changed drastically from before? She rarely conceals her figure when protecting His Highness, and even when she goes out, she only wears a hood. And... she's even attentively listening during the night classes. You share a bedroom with her, so you should know better than I do. Can you tell me what exactly happened?"

"Actually, it's nothing," Wendy shook her head, "It's her own choice."

Her attitude took Scroll by surprise, "Choice?"

"Yes, just like you guessed," Wendy closed the book, speaking frankly, "She has fallen for Prince Roland Wimbledon—of course, that's obvious even without guessing. It's not uncommon for witches to give their hearts to those who provide them shelter, as we’ve heard during the travels with the Witch Cooperation Association."

"Those are stories made up by others; most sisters haven't had good outcomes."

"Prince Roland is different."

Scroll was stunned, she hadn't expected Wendy, who not long ago shared her opinion, to say such a thing, "You know, witches can't bear children, the prince couldn't possibly..."

"The prince will marry a witch," Wendy spread her hands, "And that was straight from his own mouth to you."



How did she know... Could it be that Nightingale was present at the time? Scroll suddenly realized something, "Are you blaming me for keeping this from you? No, Wendy, I didn't say anything because I didn't want the matter to leak out and negatively affect His Highness's ascension to the throne."



Wendy was silent for a while before she spoke, "I know, and I'm not blaming you, because I said the same to Nightingale. Before I knew about this, I thought the sisters would never have a future, but since the prince doesn't mind, should we still force them to change their minds? I prefer to see Nightingale the way she is now, cheerful and following her own heart, rather than the way she was when she was suppressing her emotions and feeling down, no matter the outcome."



So that's how it is, Scroll thought. While she agreed with not spreading the news, she was not willing to stop the sisters' feelings any longer, nor did she want to make choices on their behalf—unlike Cara, Wendy always encouraged the sisters from their perspective, cheering on the little courage they had left.



"But does His Highness know about this?" Scroll suddenly thought of a serious problem, "What if his willingness is based on not understanding that witches can't bear children?"



"Um..." Wendy's voice also became more solemn, "Why don't you go ask him?"



...



Outside the Western Border City walls.



The approaching summer sun shone dazzlingly on the grasslands, and in the distance, herds of cattle and sheep could be seen leisurely grazing on the green grass. It was hard to imagine that just three months ago, this place was covered with ice and snow and nothing else but the terrifying and ferocious demonic beasts.



The shooting training had continued for most of the afternoon. Nightingale had mastered the shooting skills much faster than Roland had expected, probably because each person's innate talents differed, he thought, and some are just naturally suited for battle. Now her reloading, aiming, and shooting posture no longer looked like that of a novice.



"If she had been born in a knight's family, she would definitely become the top star knight of Graycastle," Carter couldn't help but praise, "Just like me."

"Fortunately, that's not the case; I wouldn't want her arms to become as thick as yours," Roland glanced at him, "How does it feel to fight to a draw with an extraordinary witch?"

"The moment I was hit and sent flying, I even thought I was battling against a siege hammer, my entire chest felt like it had been crushed," Carter admitted honestly, "Honestly, it was terrible."

"There probably won't be a next time," he said with a laugh.

When another round of standing shooting was completed, the prince clapped for Nightingale, "So far so good. Next, let's do a simulation training."

Nightingale slid her pistol into her belt and walked over to the prince. Under the bright sunlight, the sweat on the tip of her nose sparkled.

"Do you see those targets?" Roland pointed at the five half-body targets not far away, "They all have God's Punishment Stones hanging on them, you should be able to see them very clearly in the mist. What we're going to do next is to combine your ability and marksmanship to knock down these enemies in the shortest exposure time possible."

Because objects and space are constantly changing while in the mist, it's difficult to ensure that the bullets are flying towards the target. They had tried shooting directly in the mist before, but nine out of ten bullets changed trajectory after leaving the range of the mist, and one nearly hit Roland, who was standing behind her.

Therefore, when shooting, Nightingale must step out of the mist, and the shorter the exposure time, the harder it is for the enemies to counterattack her.



"Understood." She smiled faintly, raised her cloak with one hand, and vanished into thin air before the two of them.



When the first gunshot sounded, Roland only saw a white figure quietly appear. As the flame and smoke burst forth, the target shattered in response. Before the splinters had fully settled on the ground, she had already reached behind the second target, pulling the trigger within a three to four-meter range.



Then came the third target, the fourth... With each shot, she hadn't even fully emerged from the mist. Aside from the silver pistol and the sudden flash of light, Roland couldn't see more details, and it was even hard to catch her position with his eyes. Nightingale leaping through the mist seemed to teleport instantly—such a scene was something that could only be seen in movies. In a blink, all five targets had been smashed to pieces. He blinked, and Nightingale was back by his side.



"How was that?" she asked with a smile.



"Uh..." Roland looked at Carter, who stood by with his mouth agape, and asked, "What do you think?"



"I'm afraid no one can catch Miss Nightingale now," the Chief Knight took a deep breath, "not even Ashes with the God's Punishment Stone."



"So, does that mean I've graduated?" She wiped the sweat from her nose and rubbed it onto Roland.



"Of... course."
