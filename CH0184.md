## Since "自我" is a Chinese term which translates to "self" or "ego" in English, and not a proper noun, it would not be a term used in the novel "Release that Witch" by Er Mu for a character or a place. If "自我" appears in a context within the novel that requires translation, it would be translated based on the surrounding text and its usage. However, without additional context, it's not possible to provide a translation specific to the novel. If you provide a sentence or paragraph from the novel where "自我" is used, I can translate that for you.
Scroll hesitated at the door of the bedroom for a moment before pushing it open.

Wendy was sitting at the desk with a gloomy face, clutching a book. Without looking closely, it was clear that the book must be "The Basics of Natural Science Theories."

Scroll couldn't help but chuckle. She rarely saw Wendy with such an expression. Even when the Witch Cooperation Association was trapped in the mountains, in times of dire shortages, she still smiled and cheered on every sister, as if she had never worried about those hardships.

Unexpectedly, a book had stumped her.

"You can't understand it at all, can you?" Scroll said. "I felt the same when I first read a book."

"I thought it was Nightingale," Wendy turned her head upon hearing the voice, "...and now?"

"I still can't understand it."

"Well, you're just like me." Wendy sighed. "Not to mention Anna, I didn't expect even Soraya to grasp a new ability. I feel like if I don't work hard, I'll be surpassed by the younger generation. I really don't understand how His Highness knows so much, describing the invisible world as if it were real."

"In fact, he doesn't know much either," Scroll shrugged, "at least in certain areas."



"For example?"

"For example, the matter with Nightingale." She pulled out a stool and sat down next to Wendy, "Have you noticed that her behavior has changed drastically from before? She rarely hides her figure when protecting His Highness, and even when she goes out, she merely wears a hood. And... she's even attentively listening during evening lessons. You share a bedroom with her, so you must know better than I do. Can you tell me what exactly happened?"

"Actually, it's nothing much," Wendy shook her head, "It's her own choice."

Her attitude took Scroll by surprise, "Choice?"

"Yes, just like you guessed," Wendy closed the book and spoke frankly, "She has fallen for Prince Roland Wimbledon—of course, it's obvious even without guessing. It's not uncommon to hear rumors about witches falling for the men who offer them sanctuary during our journeys in the Witch Cooperation Association."

"Those are stories made up by others; most sisters did not end up with good outcomes."

"Prince Roland is different."

Scroll was taken aback, not expecting Wendy, who had shared the same view as her not long ago, to say such a thing, "You know, witches cannot bear children, a prince couldn't possibly..."

"A prince will marry a witch," Wendy spread her hands, "and moreover, he personally told you so."



How did she know... Could it be that Nightingale was present at the time? Scroll suddenly understood something, "Are you blaming me for keeping it from you? No, Wendy, I didn't say anything because I didn't want this matter to leak out, to negatively impact His Highness's ascension to the throne."



Wendy was silent for a long while before she spoke, "I know, I'm not blaming you, because I said the same to Nightingale. Before I knew about this, I thought our sisters would have no future, but since the prince doesn't mind, should we still force them to change their minds? Compared to Nightingale suppressing her feelings and being downcast, I prefer to see her as she is now, no matter the outcome. At least she has followed her own heart."



So that's how it is, Scroll thought. Although she agreed with the decision not to spread the news, she was unwilling to stop the sisters' affections any longer, not wanting to make choices for them—unlike Cara, Wendy has always been encouraging the sisters from their perspective, fueling their scant courage.



"But does His Highness know about this?" Scroll suddenly thought of a serious issue, "What if his willingness is based on not knowing that witches cannot bear children?"



"Um..." Wendy's voice also became grave, "Why don't you ask him?"



...

Outside the Western Region's city walls.



The near summer sun made the grasslands dazzle brightly, and in the distance, herds of cattle and sheep could be seen leisurely grazing on the grass. It was hard to imagine that three months ago, this place was covered in ice and snow, with nothing but ferocious and brutal demonic beasts.



The shooting training had been going on for most of the afternoon, and Nightingale had picked up the shooting skills much faster than Roland had anticipated. Perhaps each person's natural talent is different, he thought, and some people are just born for combat. Now her reloading, aiming, and shooting postures were completely unlike that of a novice.



"If she had been born into a knight's family, she would surely have become the top star knight of Greycastle," Carter couldn't help but praise, "Just like me."

"Good thing she wasn't. I wouldn't want her arms to become as thick as yours," Roland glanced at him, "How does it feel to fight a transcendent witch to a standstill?"

"The moment I was sent flying, I even thought I was fighting against a siege hammer, my entire chest felt like it was shattered," Carter said honestly, "Really, it was awful."

"There probably won't be a next time," he laughed.

Once another round of standing shooting was completed, the prince clapped for Nightingale, "So far so good, next we'll do a simulation training."

Nightingale holstered her pistol and walked over to the prince. Under the bright sunlight, the sweat on the tip of her nose sparkled.

"Do you see those targets?" Roland pointed at five half-body targets not far away, "They all have Divine Stones of Judgement on them, you should be able to see them very clearly in the mist. What we're going to do next is to combine your abilities and marksmanship, to take down these enemies in the shortest exposure time possible."

Because in the mist state, objects and space are constantly changing, it's hard to ensure that the bullets are flying towards the target. They had tried to shoot directly in the mist before, but nine out of ten bullets changed their trajectory after leaving the range of the mist, and one almost hit Roland, who was standing behind her.

Therefore, when shooting, Nightingale must come out of the mist, and the shorter the exposure time, the harder it is for her to be counterattacked by enemies.



"Understood." She smiled slightly, raised her cloak with one hand, and disappeared into thin air in front of the two.



When the first gunshot rang out, Roland only saw a white figure quietly materialize. Along with the burst of flame and gas, the target shattered in response. Before the splinters had even fully landed, she had already reached behind the second target, pulling the trigger within a range of three to four meters.



Then came the third, the fourth... With each shot, she hadn't even fully emerged from the mist. Apart from the silver pistol and the fleeting flash of gunfire, Roland couldn't see any more details—it was even hard for him to capture her position with his eyes. Nightingale leaping through the mist was like teleporting—a scene that could previously only be seen in movies. In the blink of an eye, all five targets were smashed to pieces. He blinked, and Nightingale was back at his side.



"How was it?" she asked with a smile.



"Uh..." Roland glanced at Carter, who was standing beside them, dumbfounded, and asked, "What do you think?"



"I'm afraid no one could catch Miss Nightingale now," the Chief Knight took a deep breath, "not even Ashes with the Divine Stone of Judgement on."



"So, does that mean I've graduated?" she wiped the sweat from her nose and rubbed it onto Roland.



"Of... course."
