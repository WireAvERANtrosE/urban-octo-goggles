## Wheat Modification
The crop rotation system doesn't matter much for villages or small towns with low population densities, but it's a waste of land to use this method in the areas surrounding large cities where land is scarce. Places like Silver City, Dragon Cliffs City, and the capital have to import a large amount of food from other towns every month.



The first step in utilizing human and animal manure is to collect it. This is why Roland decided to establish public toilets as soon as possible. It also helps to reduce the spread of diseases, beautify the living environment, and achieve multiple benefits at once. By the time the remaining groups of people arrive, the construction of the toilets should be almost complete. As for how to compost and how to plow and sow the fields, he decided to select a group of experienced old farmers in a few days to teach them separately. After all, the land is still in the stage of leveling and clearing, and it will take at least a week before plowing can begin.



After finishing his current tasks, he decided to visit the experimental field in the back garden to see Leaf's progress.



Ever since he had Leaf research various seed improvements, all the places in the garden where flowers could be planted were sown with crops. She also followed Roland's suggestion, dividing the flowerbed into many sections and numbering them, allowing for a comparison of the developmental results of two sets of experimental crops.



As soon as Roland stepped into the yard, he was dazzled by the clusters of golden wheat.



"Your Highness." Upon seeing the prince, Leaf, who was squatting by the flowerbed, stood up, brushed the hair by her ear, and bowed respectfully.



"Is this the result of your improvements?" He waved his hand, indicating that she need not be overly formal, and walked over excitedly to pick up a heavy ear of wheat, using his fingers to feel its plump grains.



He had no concept of what wheat should look like, but compared to his childhood memories of the wheat fields in the capital, those ears of wheat were not only smaller than the ones he was holding but also had many shrunken grains.



Leaf nodded and said, "I started by making the wheat ears bigger, then after hastening the ripening and harvesting the seeds, I planted the new seeds back into the flowerbed, and that's how I got these wheat ears. However... after repeating this process and sowing seeds for two or three rounds, it becomes difficult to grow wheat ears that are both large and long. I'm not sure why."



Unfortunately, I can't help with that, Roland thought. Based on his limited middle school biology knowledge, it was probably due to inbreeding depression? The south cultivated rice, which was worlds apart from wheat, and to increase yield, seeds were also bought. However, maintaining them for two generations already had practical value. A wheat plant could produce more than one hundred and thirty seeds, with the first batch being transformed by the leaves, and then allowing the farmers to keep their own seeds for at least two years of use.



"Why is this area empty?" Roland noticed a flower bed with only a few dried wheat stalks.



"I started planting there," Leaf said uncertainly, "perhaps it's because I planted too many times. If I cast magic, the wheat can grow rapidly, but once I withdraw the magic, they wilt quickly."



It seemed that the plants modified by magic still needed the land to provide nutrition for continued growth, and some trace elements were still essential. Roland walked to the last flower bed, where the wheat planted was of a very strange shape, with several clusters of blue wheat spikes hanging on the arm-thick stalk, and several branches extended from the middle of the stalk, covered with green leaves. As a result, each wheat plant was also quite large, with only two planted in the flower bed.



This was the magical variation of wheat that Roland had Leaf experiment with—the Wheat Tree.



His idea was to make wheat grow like banana trees, bearing fruit from the branches, harvested regularly every year, in order to save the trouble of plowing and sowing. At the same time, it would grow larger and more leaves to increase photosynthesis and reduce the demand for land. Currently, the stout wheat stalks and branches were somewhat space-occupying, and only having wheat spikes grow at the branch ends did not meet the initial idea. Perhaps let Leaf try to improve in the direction of grapevines? Roland thought. After all, she had not seen real banana trees, and grapes were not a rare product in Greycastle. It would probably be easier to imitate with a comparison.



"The seeds of these three wheat plants can't be used for sowing," Leaf said, "I've tried it, and the wheat grains can't germinate after being planted. But they can indeed bear fruit repeatedly; the wheat spikes you see are already the second batch."



Being unable to germinate meant that each Wheat Tree was unique and required Leaf's personal transformation; currently, they were not of great planting value. "You've done very well. The variety with the big wheat spikes will be called Golden One. I'll leave a plot of experimental field for you on the south bank of the Redwater River, enclosed with fences and boards. Hurry and ripen a batch of Golden One there for this year's spring sowing," Roland instructed, "As for the garden, continue to use it for the improvement of new varieties. I've just come up with quite a few ideas. Not only wheat, but grapes are also worth trying."



It was a pity that Leaf could only understand the characteristics of a crop from a macro perspective: such as yield, sweet taste, dense branches, etc... If she could understand on a microscopic level, would she be able to directly manipulate genes and make precise adjustments? For example, allowing plants to absorb light beyond visible light - such as ultraviolet, X-rays, or even ionizing radiation for photosynthesis, directly producing starch, glucose, sucrose, and other energy storage substances. Then people could directly grow crops in culture tanks.



By evening, the Fourth Prince had lit a bonfire by the Redwater River, ordering Carter and the personal guards to gather all the serfs. One by one, large pots were carried to this location by the civilians, set upon newly erected simple mud stoves, and lit to cook porridge.



The serfs looked at their new master, who stood with his back to the bonfire, his figure casting a long shadow in the firelight, and lowered their heads in fear. Some of the bolder ones still stole glances at the prince from time to time.



Roland stood in front of the bonfire and announced to the more than a thousand people his newly established regulations.



"I am Roland Wimbledon, the Fourth Prince of Greycastle, the Lord of Border Town, and the ruler of the Western Territory!"



"I have gathered you here to tell you that it is your good fortune to have come to this domain! As long as you work hard, you will be able to rid yourselves of your current status and position!"



"That's right, I will give you a chance to shed your serfdom and become free people!"



A commotion immediately rose among the serfs. They were very clear about what it meant to be free people—they would no longer have to endure the cruel abuse of their masters, no longer be forced into endless toiling, the crops from the fields would not all have to be handed over to the master, and their sons and daughters could also be freed from the status of serfdom.



Roland waited a moment and then continued: "Starting tomorrow, each of you will receive a piece of fixed land, and there will be people to guide you on how to cultivate it to yield more wheat. In the first year, you can keep thirty percent of the harvest for yourselves, and the remaining seventy percent will be handed over to Border Town. The group with the best harvest will be promoted to free people!"



"After becoming free people, your families will also be exempt from serfdom, and whether you continue to farm or look for other livelihoods in town is for you to decide. Those who choose to farm will hand over twenty percent of the grain harvest as tenant rent, and the remaining eighty percent is yours to manage. Those who choose other livelihoods will return the land to the lordship, and of course, will not need to hand over any grain!"



As these words were spoken, only the sound of breathing remained at the scene. Suddenly, someone shouted, "Your Highness, is everything you said true?"



"Of course," Roland enunciated each word clearly, "As the lord, I never deceive my people."



"His Highness is merciful," someone couldn't help but murmur, and soon the voice grew louder, "Long live Prince Roland!"



A serf in the front row knelt down as the shout rose, followed by a second and a third...



Until the field was filled with a dark mass of kneeling figures, the calls overlapping each other, growing more and more numerous, louder and louder. The voices of the people finally merged into the same rhythm, "His Highness is merciful!" "Long live Prince Roland!"



Once the echo started, there was no need for any prompting, the prince thought.



He clapped his hands and instructed the guards behind him, "Start the meal!"
