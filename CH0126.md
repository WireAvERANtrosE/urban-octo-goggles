## Wheat Modification
The crop rotation system doesn't matter much for villages or small towns with low population density, but for large cities with scarce surrounding land, using this method is equivalent to wasting land. Places like Silver City, Falling Dragon Ridge, and the King's City have to import large quantities of food from other towns every month.

The first step in using manure from humans and animals is to collect it. This is why Roland decided to establish public toilets as soon as possible, which can also reduce the spread of diseases, improve living conditions, and offer multiple benefits. By the time the remaining batches of people arrive, the toilets should be almost completed. As for how to compost and how to till and sow the land, he decided to select a group of experienced farmers to teach separately in a few days. After all, the land is still in the stage of leveling and clearing, and it will take at least a week to start plowing.

After finishing the task at hand, he decided to visit the experimental field in the back garden where Leaf was working.

Ever since he asked Leaf to research the improvement of various seeds, all the places in the garden where flowers could be planted were sown with crops instead. Following Roland's suggestion, she divided the flower beds into many sections and numbered them to compare the developmental results of two sets of experimental crops.

As soon as Roland stepped into the yard, he was dazzled by the golden wheat.

"Your Highness," Leaf, who was squatting by the flower bed, stood up, tucked her hair behind her ears, and bowed.

"Is this the result of your improvement?" He waved his hand, indicating that she didn't need to be overly formal, and walked over excitedly to hold a heavy ear of wheat, feeling its plump grains with his fingers.

He had no concept of what wheat should look like, but compared to the wheat he remembered from the fields in the King's City during his childhood, those ears of wheat were not only smaller than what he was holding, but the grains were also much shriveled.

Leaf nodded, "I first made the wheat ears bigger and harvested the seeds when they matured. Then, planting the new seeds back into the flower bed produced ears like this. However... after repeating this process and replanting two or three times, it becomes very difficult to grow ears that are both large and long. I'm not sure why."

I'm sorry, but I can't help with that, Roland thought. Based on his poor and pitiful knowledge of middle school biology, it was probably due to inbreeding defects? Rice was grown in the south, which was vastly different from wheat, and to increase yield, seeds were also bought. However, it was already of practical value if it could be maintained for two generations. A wheat plant could produce more than one hundred and thirty seeds, with the first batch of seeds transformed by leaves, and then letting the farmers keep seeds for themselves, which could be used for at least two years.

"Why is this spot empty?" Roland noticed a flower bed with only a few withered wheat stalks.

"I started planting there, maybe because I planted too many times," Leaf said uncertainly, "If I cast magic, the wheat can grow quickly, but once the magic is withdrawn, they wilt very fast."

It seems that plants modified by magic still need the land to provide nutrients to continue growing, and some trace elements are still indispensable. Roland walked to the last flower bed, where the wheat planted looked very strange, with several clusters of blue wheat ears hanging on a stalk as thick as an arm, and several branches extending from the middle of the stalk, laden with green leaves. Therefore, each wheat plant was also quite large, with only two planted in the flower bed.

This was the magic-modified version that Roland had asked Leaf to try — the Wheat Tree.

His idea was to make the wheat like a banana tree, bearing fruit on the branches, harvested regularly every year, thus avoiding the trouble of plowing and sowing, and growing larger and more leaves to increase photosynthesis and reduce the demand for land. At present, the thick wheat stalks and branches took up a bit too much space, and only having ears of wheat grow at the end of the branches did not match the initial idea. Perhaps, Roland thought, let Leaf try to improve in the direction of grapevines? After all, she had never seen a real banana tree, and grapes were not a rare product in Greycastle, so it should be easier to imitate with a comparison.

"These three wheat plants' seeds cannot be used for sowing," Leaf said, "I've tried, and the grains of wheat cannot germinate after planting. But it can indeed bear fruit repeatedly, and the wheat ears you see are already the second batch."

The inability to germinate meant that each Wheat Tree was a unique existence, requiring Leaf's personal transformation, and currently had little value for planting. "You've done a good job, the large-eared wheat variety will be called Golden One. I will leave a trial field for you on the south bank of the Redwater River, enclosed with fences and partitions, and you will quickly mature a batch of Golden One there for this year's spring plowing and sowing," Roland instructed, "As for the garden, continue to use it for improving new varieties, I've just come up with a lot of ideas. Not only wheat crops, but grapes are also worth trying."

Unfortunately, Leaf could only understand the characteristics of a crop from a macro level: such as being sturdy, sweet taste, dense branches, and so on... If she could understand at a microscopic level, could she directly manipulate genes, making fine and precise adjustments? For example, allowing plants to absorb light beyond visible light—such as ultraviolet, X-rays, or even ionizing radiation for photosynthesis, directly producing starch, glucose, sucrose, and other energy-storing substances, then people could directly grow crops in culture tanks.

By dusk, the fourth prince had lit a bonfire by the Redwater River, and had Carter and the guards gather all the serfs. Pots and large cauldrons were carried over by the common folk, placed on the newly constructed makeshift clay stoves, and lit to boil porridge.

The serfs looked at their new master, whose figure cast a long shadow against the firelight, and lowered their heads in fear. Some of the bolder ones still stole glances at the prince from time to time.

Roland stood before the bonfire, announcing his decrees to the crowd of over a thousand people.

"I am Roland Wimbledon, the fourth prince of Greycastle, the lord of Border Town, and the master of the Western Territory!"

"I have gathered you here to tell you that it is your fortune to have come to these lands! Work hard, and you can shed your current status and identity!"

"That's right, I will give you the opportunity to be rid of your servile status and become freemen!"

A murmur of astonishment rose among the serfs. They knew very well what it meant to be freemen—they would no longer have to endure their master's cruel abuse, no longer be forced into endless toil, the crops from the fields would not have to be handed over in their entirety to their master, and their sons and daughters could escape the status of serfdom.

After waiting a moment, Roland continued, "Starting tomorrow, each of you will be allocated a fixed plot of land, and there will be people to instruct you on how to farm so that you can harvest more wheat. In the first year, you may keep thirty percent of the harvest for yourselves, while seventy percent must be turned over to Border Town. The group with the best harvest will be promoted to freemen!"

"After becoming freemen, your families will also be freed from serfdom, and whether you continue to farm or seek other livelihoods in town will be up to you. Those who choose to farm will pay twenty percent of the grain harvest as rent, while the remaining eighty percent is yours to control. Those who seek other livelihoods will return the land to the lord, and of course, will not need to pay any grain."

As these words were spoken, the only sound left at the scene was that of breathing. Suddenly, someone shouted, "Your Highness, is everything you said true?"
"Of course," Roland enunciated each word, "as a lord, I never deceive my subjects."
"His Highness is merciful," someone couldn't help but whisper, and then the voice quickly grew louder, "Long live Prince His Highness!"
A serf in the front row knelt as the shouts rang out, followed by a second, and then a third...
Until there was a dense crowd of people kneeling down, the calls rising and falling, growing more numerous and louder. The voices of the people finally merged into one rhythm, "His Highness is merciful!" "Long live Prince His Highness!"
With the echo, there was no need for prompting anymore, the prince thought.
He clapped his hands and instructed the guards behind him, "Start the meal!"
