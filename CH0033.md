## Gunpowder
"Stand up, the Fourth Prince is coming." Before Iron Axe had a chance to rest even a quarter of an hour, he clapped his hands and shouted. 

Van quickly returned to his position. His special training had conditioned him to obey commands. Almost subconsciously, he had already picked up the wooden pole and assumed the pre-strike position he had practiced earlier. 

As the prince and his party walked onto the city wall, passing behind the team, Van caught sight of His Highness slowing down as he passed his position. 

Roland sighed inwardly. As the saying goes, rising late ruins the morning, rising early ruins the day, and that indeed was the truth. He had just finished dealing with the aftermath of a night attack on the castle and now had to rush over to inspect the recent training results of the militia. Poor him, he hadn't slept all night and was now drowsy. But he couldn't not come, the team was now in the stage of pre-war training. As the supreme commander, if he didn't show up for a long time, his presence would diminish and the people would become unsettled. 

Hmm…what should he say during the inspection? Roland thought about it. Comrades, you've worked hard? If no one responds to the latter part, shouting this slogan would be embarrassing. It would be better to casually chat with someone, show his respect for the wise and the virtuous, and boost his reputation. 

With that in mind, he patted a young man who looked somewhat robust. 

"Training must be hard, are you tired? How are your meals?" 

Based on his experience watching news, the other party should respond excitedly with, "Not tired, it's great!" However, while his response was indeed excited, he turned around and immediately knelt on one knee, giving Roland quite a fright. 

Van felt as though he'd been blessed by the heavens, the Fourth Prince was actually asking him in a caring tone whether he was tired from training! Usually, let alone the royal family, even ordinary nobles wouldn't bother to talk to them. He subconsciously imitated the knight's salute to the prince, not caring whether this set of etiquette was suitable for him or not. All he could think was, when he returned to the old street, he, Van, could also be considered a person of significance.

After being asked to stand up, Van'er's mind was still in confusion, he couldn't remember how he had responded.

Finally, when His Highness asked if anyone had any suggestions or opinions about the training, Van'er suddenly became more sober—this was a good opportunity! If he could convince His Highness that the militia alone could not bear the responsibility of defending the city walls, would he not have to worry about whether to run or stay all day?

He carefully considered his words, "Your...Your Highness, the current number of the militia is really too small. According to the current formation of training, when the demonic beasts attack, everyone can at most defend less than one-third of the city walls. What do you think..."

Even if the prince recruited a few more batches, there might not be enough time for training, Van'er thought. Furthermore, the weapons these people used were also a big expense, Border Town would find it hard to gather three hundred spears for use within two months, even one hundred would be a stretch—so they were still training with wooden poles.

If Prince Roland could realize this, he might recruit a batch of mercenaries from other towns to serve as the main defense force. At least they could go directly to the battlefield without training, and bring their own weapons and armor, even if the price was high.

Roland pondered for a moment, then nodded, "You're right, it's indeed unrealistic to rely on a single militia to guard the entire city wall."

Van'er was delighted, did His Highness agree with his view?

However, the Fourth Prince did not say the words he was hoping to hear next, instead, he called Iron Axe over, "In a sense, demonic beasts are nothing more than a variant of wild beasts, they don't have the ability to think, right?"

"Yes, Your Highness, ordinary demonic beasts are no different from wild beasts, even their habits are basically the same... but for the mixed breeds, I have not seen many, so I can't be sure,"

"That will do. Although it's almost 1800 feet (600 meters) from Redwater River to the foot of the North Slope Mountain, we can lure them to attack a specific area."
"Do you mean setting a trap?" Iron Axe asked.
"It is a trap, but not the kind commonly used by hunters. Ordinary traps rely on hiding themselves to capture prey, but I plan to do the opposite. Set up pocket-shaped roadblocks far away from the city walls, such as fences, earth slopes, and water ditches, to force these brainless demonic beasts to automatically detour. Continuous obstacles will guide the prey to a designated location, eventually concentrating in our prepared defense area," Roland said, looking at Iron Axe, "As for how to lure these monsters, I think no one is better at it than you."
Iron Axe thought for a while, "Guiding them is not a problem. The wolves don't like water, the wild boars are afraid of light, other demonic beasts also have their own habits. But Your Highness, doing so will cause all demonic beasts to concentrate within this 600 feet range, isn't it too dangerous?"
"If we rely solely on spears and arrows, indeed." Roland said confidently, "However, we now have new weapons."
When it was time to leave, the prince came again behind Van'er, patted his shoulder, "Good observation skills, what's your name?"
"Van...Van'er, Your Highness."
"I will suggest to my chief knight to appoint you as the deputy of the spear team, Mr. Van'er, keep up the good work."
...

Roland had built a new bungalow in the back yard of the smelting room for the production of "snow powder"—which was gunpowder.
This room, about three hundred square meters, only had one entrance and exit, and implemented the strictest security system. Two knights guarded the entrance, and anyone who entered had to register and be searched to prevent the introduction of fire sources. No fire was allowed inside, so work was only carried out during the day. In order to prevent Nightingale from sneaking in, a gauze curtain was hung at the door frame.
"Is this the new weapon you speak of?" Carter, who had been summoned, pinched a bit of the black powder with his fingers and sniffed it before his nose, "Isn't this snow powder?"
Iron Axe might not know, but Carter often attended royal ceremonies, so naturally, he knew that this stuff was what filled the ceremonial barrels. The proud work of the alchemist's workshop, the formula was a secret to outsiders, but if the prince wanted it, he could definitely get it.
"It is snow powder, but not entirely," Roland said, "the latest improved product from the alchemist’s workshop, I call it gunpowder."
Gunpowder was a must-have tool for any transmigrator. The materials were widely available, and as long as one knew the optimal ratio of sulphur, charcoal, and saltpeter, 1:1.5:7.5, it could be made without any technological barriers.
The snow powder of this era was an inferior product with charcoal accounting for sixty percent, sulphur and saltpeter accounting for twenty percent, and other strange materials (such as mercury, butter, honey, etc.) accounting for twenty percent. It burned slowly, released less gas, and did not fully demonstrate the effect of gunpowder. But Roland knew that alchemists were constantly testing other ratios, and within at most thirty years, snow powder with a formula closer to standard black powder would appear.
In history, it took a long time after the invention of gunpowder for cold weapons to be completely phased out due to the formula and the corresponding weapons manufacturing technology not catching up.
However, many people overlooked that even without relying on guns, gunpowder itself was a formidable weapon.
