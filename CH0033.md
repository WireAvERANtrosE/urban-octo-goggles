## Gunpowder
"Everyone, stand up, His Highness the Fourth Prince is here." Not even fifteen minutes into their rest, Iron Axe clapped his hands and shouted.

Tanner quickly returned to his spot. The special training earlier had conditioned him to obey commands reflexively, and almost subconsciously, he had already picked up the wooden pole and assumed the preparatory stance for thrusting that he had practiced before.

The prince and his entourage walked up onto the town wall, passing by the troops from behind. Tanner, out of the corner of his eye, noticed that His Highness slowed his pace as he passed by his position.

Roland sighed inwardly, lamenting the saying that sleeping in ruins the morning, and waking up early ruins the whole day. It was indeed true. He had just finished dealing with the aftermath of the night attack on the castle and now had to rush to review the militia's recent training progress. Poor him, he hadn't slept all night, and now he was struggling to stay awake. But he couldn't just not show up. Now that the troops had entered the combat training phase, as their supreme commander, his prolonged absence would lead to a decline in morale and cause instability among his people.

Hmm... what should one usually say during an inspection? Roland pondered. "Greetings comrades, you've all worked hard"? It would be awkward to shout out such a slogan if no one responded. Maybe it's better to just casually pull someone aside to chat, to show that he appreciates his subordinates and to boost his reputation.

That's what he planned to do as he patted a young man who looked quite sturdy.

"Training must be tough, do you feel tired? Are the meals satisfying?"

Based on his experience from watching the news, the other party should respond excitedly with a loud "Not tired, very good!" Indeed, the man was excited, but he turned around and knelt on one knee, giving Roland quite a shock.

Tanner felt as though he was blessed by the heavens. The Fourth Prince actually spoke to him with a tone of concern, asking if he was tired from training! Normally, let alone royalty, even ordinary nobles wouldn't bother speaking more than a word to them. Instinctively, he mimicked the way a knight would salute to the prince, not caring whether the etiquette was appropriate for him, and one thought filled his mind: when he returned to Old Street, he, Tanner, would also be regarded as a noteworthy figure.



After being asked to stand up, Tanner's mind was still in chaos, and he couldn't remember exactly how he had responded.

Finally, when His Highness asked if there were any opinions or thoughts regarding the training that could be brought up, Tanner suddenly became much clearer-headed—this was a great opportunity! If he could make His Highness realize that relying solely on the militia to bear the burden of guarding the walls was impractical, then perhaps he wouldn't have to worry every day about whether to run or stay.

He carefully brewed his words in his mind, "Your... Your Highness, the current number of the militia is simply too small. With the way we are training now, when the demonic beasts attack, at most, we can only defend less than a third of the town walls. You see..."

Even if the prince recruits several more batches, there might not be enough time for training, Tanner thought. Moreover, the weapons these people are using are a major expense, and Border Town will have difficulty gathering long spears for three hundred people within two months, even one hundred is quite a stretch—hence they are still using wooden poles for training.

If the Prince realizes this, maybe he will recruit a group of mercenaries from other towns to serve as the main defense force. At least they wouldn't need training to go straight to the battlefield and would bring their own weapons and armor, even if they are more expensive.

Roland thought for a moment and then nodded, "You are right, it is indeed unrealistic to rely on just a militia to guard the entire town wall."

Tanner's heart leaped with joy, did His Highness mean... he agreed with his view?

But the Fourth Prince did not say the words he was hoping to hear next; instead, he called Iron Axe over, "In a sense, demonic beasts are just a variant of wild beasts, they do not have the ability to think, right?"

"Yes, Your Highness, ordinary demonic beasts are still no different from wild beasts, even their habits are largely the same... But as for mixed breeds, I have not seen many and dare not be certain."



"That's fine, although there is a distance of nearly 1,800 feet (about 600 meters) from the Redwater River to the foot of Northslope Mountain, we can lure them to attack a specific area."

"You mean set up a trap?" Iron Axe asked.

"It is a trap, but not like the ones hunters usually use. Ordinary traps rely on hiding themselves to capture prey, whereas I plan to do the opposite—set up pocket-type roadblocks far from the town walls, such as fences, earth slopes, and ditches, to force these brainless beasts to detour instinctively. Continuous obstacles will guide the prey to the designated location, eventually concentrating them in the defense area we have prepared," Roland said, looking towards Iron Axe, "As for how to lure these monsters, I think no one is better at that than you."

Iron Axe thought for a moment, "Guiding them is not a problem. Wolves don't like to touch water, boars are afraid of light, and other demonic beasts have their own habits. But Your Highness, doing this will lead to all the demonic beasts gathering within this small section, isn't that too dangerous?"

"If we were only relying on spears and bows, indeed it would be." Roland said confidently, "However, now we have new weapons."

When it was time to leave, the Prince came up behind Tanner again and patted his shoulder, "You have good observational skills, what is your name?"

"Tan... Tanner, Your Highness."

"I will propose to my Chief Knight to have you serve as the deputy commander of the spear squad, Mr. Tanner, do your best."



Roland had built a new bungalow in the backyard of the smelting room, which was used to produce snow powder—also known as gunpowder.

This room of around three hundred square meters had only one entrance and exit and was under the strictest security system. Two knights stood guard at the door, and anyone entering had to register and be searched to prevent the introduction of any fire-starting materials. No sources of fire were allowed inside, so work was only carried out during the daytime. To prevent Nightingale from sneaking in, gauze curtains were also hung at the door frame.

"Is this the new weapon you talked about?" Carter, who had been summoned, pinched a bit of the black powder with his fingers and sniffed it in front of his nose, "Isn't this snow powder?"

Iron Axe might not be aware, but Carter, who often attended royal ceremonies, naturally knew that the stuff filled in the salute barrels was exactly this. It was the proud creation of the Alchemy Workshop, and while the formula was a secret to outsiders, the prince could certainly obtain it if he wished.

"It is snow powder, but also not quite," Roland said, "It's the Alchemy Workshop's latest improved product. I call it gunpowder."

Gunpowder could be said to be an essential development tool for any transmigrator. With materials widely available, as long as one knew the optimal ratio of sulfur, charcoal, and saltpeter as 1:1.5:7.5, it could be produced without any technical barriers.

The snow powder of this era was a low-quality product consisting of sixty percent charcoal, twenty percent sulfur and saltpeter, and the remaining twenty percent were odd materials like mercury, butter, honey, etc. It burned slowly, released little gas, and could not fully exhibit gunpowder's intended effects. However, Roland knew that the alchemists were also constantly experimenting with other proportions, and within thirty years at most, snow powder that came close to the standard formula for black powder would appear.

In history, after the invention of gunpowder, it took a long time to completely phase out cold weapons, due to the formula and the fact that the corresponding weapon manufacturing technology could not keep up.

Yet many overlooked the fact that even without relying on guns, gunpowder itself was an extremely formidable weapon.
