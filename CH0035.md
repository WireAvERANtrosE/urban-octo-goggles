## Destiny
Nightingale walked within the "Mist".

From here, the world was reduced to mere black and white.

The lines that once defined objects were no longer clear-cut; straight lines, broken lines, and curves all blurred together, resembling the scribbles of a child.

It was an indescribable sensation, one that took Nightingale a great deal of time to become accustomed to. However, once she mastered it, she could move freely within the Mist, unhindered by the physical world. What seemed like continuous walls could reveal entrances that simply didn't exist in reality, just by viewing them from a different angle.

In the Mist, up and down, forward and backward were no longer fixed concepts; they could interchange or even overlap with one another. Like what she was doing at the moment, entering the castle right under the guards' noses, following those unpredictable lines, stepping into thin air, ascending through the ceiling, and arriving in Anna's room.

For her, this was a world of absolute freedom.

Only within the "Mist" could Nightingale truly relax, despite its silence and solitude. She cherished the sense of being unthreatened.

Most of the time, this place was in blacks and whites, but occasionally, she could see other colors.

Like the Anna before her eyes.



Witches are different from ordinary people; they are a congregation of magical power. Nightingale can see the flow and dissipation of this power, which is also the only color in the mist.



She had never seen a color as full and intense as Anna's—a verdant luster surged around her, nearly incandescent at the center, almost blinding to look at. This puzzled Nightingale greatly. Generally, the color of a witch's magic closely matched her abilities. Nightingale had seen many witches with the power to manipulate flames during her time with the Witch Cooperation Association, most of whom were orange or dark red, like a dancing fireball. In terms of size and brightness, none could compare to Anna.



If that was merely difficult to understand, what came next was truly inconceivable.



With such a vast amount of magic converging within her, how was she still alive?



Throughout the entire Witch Cooperation Association, Nightingale couldn't find anyone with such an amount of magical power, not even among the adult witches, who paled in comparison. If Anna were to reach adulthood...



No, she would not have that chance, Nightingale sighed. The stronger the magic, the stronger the backlash. She couldn't even begin to imagine the terrible torture Anna would face when the demonic bite occurred. The pain of being torn apart from the inside out wouldn't let one lose consciousness. Until one gave up resistance and accepted death, the pain would be endured incessantly and without pause.



She stepped out of the mist, temporarily shelving her despondent thoughts, and perked up to say, "Good morning, Anna."



Anna, accustomed to the other's uninvited and sudden appearances, nodded without responding and continued to practice controlling the flames.



Nightingale touched her nose and sat down beside the girl's bed.



She had seen this kind of practice many times before. At first, Anna would accidentally set her own clothes on fire, and there was always a bucket full of replacement clothes ready for her in the shed in the back garden. Later on, she could skillfully make flames dance on her fingertips, and even Roland no longer urged her to practice. The wooden shed in the garden was taken down and turned into a place to enjoy afternoon tea and sunbathe.



Even so, Anna still followed the prince's previous instructions and practiced for one to two hours every day—in her own room.



"I brought some fish cakes, do you want some?" Nightingale pulled out a cloth wrap from her bosom, unfolded it, and offered it to the other person.



Anna sniffed and nodded her head.



"Go wash your hands," Nightingale said with a smile. Thankfully, she didn't dislike her; she was just not good at conversation. Speaking of which, she clearly cared about Nana but also didn't talk much. In fact, except in front of Roland, she rarely spoke.



By contrast, Roland talked too much. He always had endless reasons and rules, even when eating—like washing hands before meals, not eating too quickly, not picking up food that fell on the ground to eat, and so on... He could elaborate a lengthy discourse on each rule.



At first, she was extremely impatient with this, but after all, he was the master of this place, the Fourth Prince of Greycastle. Since she was eating his food and staying under his roof, she might as well listen to him. Now, she had gradually become accustomed to these rules. For some reason, she felt an inexplicable sense of fun when queuing up to wash hands with Anna, Nana, Roland, Carter, and others.



Anna dipped her hands in a bucket full of well water and rubbed them together, then ignited a small flame to dry them off. She pinched a fish cake, sat back at the table, and started nibbling on it in small bites.



"Are you really not going to come back with me?" Nightingale made conversation. "There are many sisters there; they will take good care of you."



"Here, you can only move within the castle's boundaries. Don't you find it suffocating?"



"The Impassable Mountain Range may not have abundant resources, but everyone is family there, gathered for the same purpose."



"With your strength, they would welcome you warmly."



"This winter, I'm afraid you won't make it through..."



As she spoke, Nightingale's voice trailed off, perhaps it was already too late. She thought, even if she returned to the camp, with her current immense magical power, it would be nearly impossible to survive to adulthood. All she could do was watch her dwindle away.



"Before you joined the Witch Cooperation Association, where did you live?"



Nightingale paused, she rarely asked herself questions, "I... I used to live in a big city to the east, not far from the King's City."



"Were you happy there?"



Happy? No, it was a period she did not want to remember—living at the mercy of others, being looked down upon, mocked. After discovering she had become a witch, she was treated like an animal chained by the neck and forced to work for them. Nightingale shook her head and asked softly, "Why do you ask this?"



"I used to live in the old district," Anna simply recounted her past, "My father sold me to the church for 25 gold royals. It was His Highness who brought me out of the cage. I am very happy here."

"But you cannot leave this castle, and apart from Roland Wimbledon, others still hate witches."

"I don't mind, and besides, he said he would change all this, didn't he?"

"That's very difficult, as long as the church stands, witches will always be deemed evil."

Anna did not argue, and there was a long silence, so long that Nightingale thought she would never speak again, but then she suddenly asked, "Are you happier with the Association, or here?"

"You... what are you talking about?" Nightingale was caught off guard, "Of course, it's..."

The Association? To be honest, she was not very interested in searching for the Holy Mountain, but there she had friends she couldn't leave behind.

Border Town? If she hadn't heard that a witch was in danger, she would have never come here!

The answer should be obvious, but why couldn't she say it immediately?



This time, Anna revealed a smile, a sight Nightingale seldom saw. Her eyes were like a lake reflecting the dawn, inexplicably comforting—even though she herself was not within the Mist. "I heard from Roland that you were searching for the Holy Mountain in the northern mountains. If the Holy Mountain signifies peace and belonging, I think I have already found it."

This place was her Holy Mountain, Nightingale realized, even though her life was nearing its end, her soul would reach the other shore sooner than most witches.

Just then, the sound of hurried footsteps came from outside the door, and Nightingale listened carefully—it seemed to be Nana's.

The door burst open and in rushed Nana Pine.

With a tear-streaked face, she threw herself into Anna's arms, "What... what should I do? Sister Anna, my father has discovered that I am a witch!"
