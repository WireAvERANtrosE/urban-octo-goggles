## Homecoming
Nightingale walked through the "Mist".
From this perspective, the world was reduced to only black and white.
Lines that originally formed objects were no longer clear, the boundaries between straight lines, broken lines, and curves became blurred, like a child's scribbles.
It was a feeling hard to describe, and it took Nightingale a long time to familiarize herself with how to distinguish these boundaries. As long as she used it properly, she could move freely in the Mist, unhindered by ordinary objects. A wall that seemed solid, if viewed from a slightly different angle, could reveal an entrance that absolutely didn't exist in the real world.
In the Mist, up and down, front and back were no longer fixed concepts. They would interchange, even overlap. Like what she was doing now, stepping into the castle under the guards' noses, following the unpredictable lines, ascending step by step out of thin air, passing through the ceiling, and arriving in Anna's room.
For her, this was a completely free world.
Only when she was in the "Mist" did Nightingale truly relax. Despite its silence and solitude, she enjoyed the feeling of being unthreatened.
Most of the time, it was black and white here, but occasionally she could also see other colors.
Like Anna in front of her now.

Witches are different from ordinary people, they are the embodiment of magic. Nightingale could see this force flowing and dissipating, and it was the only color in the fog.
She had never seen a color as rich and intense as Anna's—a vibrant green light swirled around her, the core nearing incandescent, making it almost impossible to look at directly. This puzzled Nightingale greatly. Generally, the color of magic closely resembled the abilities manifested. During her time in the Witch Cooperation Association, she had seen many witches with the ability to manipulate fire, most of them were either orange or dark red, like a pulsating fireball, but none of them, regardless of size and brightness, could compare to Anna.
If this was hard enough to understand, the next point was truly inconceivable.
With such tremendous magic gathered within her, how was Anna still alive?
Among the entire Witch Cooperation Association, Nightingale couldn't find anyone possessing such magic, even the adult witches paled in comparison. If Anna were to become an adult…
No, she wouldn't have that chance, Nightingale sighed. The stronger the magic, the stronger the backlash. She didn't even dare to imagine the horrific torment Anna would face when devil's bite arrived. The excruciating pain of being torn from the inside out wouldn't cause one to lose consciousness, until the moment one gave up resistance and accepted death, the relentless pain would continue.
She stepped out of the fog, temporarily shelving her gloomy thoughts, and mustered up her spirits, saying, "Good Morning, Anna."
Anna had already grown accustomed to Nightingale's uninvited and sudden appearances. She nodded without replying and continued practicing her fire control.
Nightingale touched her nose and sat down beside the girl's bed.

She had seen such training many times. At first, Anna would accidentally set her clothes on fire, and in the shed in the backyard, a full bucket of clothes was prepared for her to change into. Later on, she was able to skillfully let the flames dance at her fingertips, and even Roland no longer urged her to practice. The wooden shed in the yard was dismantled and turned into a place to enjoy afternoon tea and sunbathe.

Even so, Anna still followed the prince's previous instructions and practiced for one to two hours every day—in her own room.

"I brought fish cakes, do you want some?" Nightingale pulled out a cloth bag from her bosom, unfolded it, and handed it to the other party.

Anna sniffed and nodded.

"Go wash your hands." Nightingale laughed. Fortunately, she didn't dislike herself, she was just not good at conversation. Speaking of which, she obviously cared a lot about Nana, but she didn't talk much either. In fact, apart from in front of Roland, she hardly ever spoke.

In contrast, Roland talked a lot. He always had endless reasons, even eating had many rules—such as washing hands before meals, not eating too fast, not picking up and eating food that fell on the ground, and so on... He could give a lengthy explanation for each one.

At first, she was extremely impatient, but the other party was the host here, the Fourth Prince of Greycastle. Since she ate and lived at his place, she reluctantly listened. Now, she has slowly gotten used to these rules. Somehow, when she was competing with Anna, Nana, Roland, Carter, and others for the order of washing hands, she inexplicably felt a sense of fun.

Anna reached her hand into the bucket full of well water and rubbed it, then lit a ball of fire to dry it. She pinched a fish cake, sat back at the table, and began to nibble it little by little.

"Do you really not want to come back with me?" Nightingale tried to make conversation, "There are many sisters there, they will take good care of you."

"Here, you can only move within the castle, don't you find it stifling?"

"Although the resources in the Impassable Mountain Range are scarce, we are all one family, gathered together for the same purpose."

"With your great power, they will welcome you."

"This winter, I'm afraid you won't make it..."

As she spoke, Nightingale's voice trailed off. Perhaps it was already too late, she thought. Even if she were to return to the camp, with this enormous amount of magic power, it was almost impossible to survive past adulthood. All she could do now was watch her demise.

"Where did you live before joining the Witch Cooperation Association?"

Nightingale was stunned. She rarely asked herself questions. "I... I used to live in a big city to the east, not far from the King's City."

"Did you live happily?"

Happy? No, those were days she didn't want to remember. Living under other people's roof, being despised and ridiculed. When she discovered she had become a witch, she was watched like a cat or dog, a chain was put around her neck, and she was forced to work for them. Nightingale shook her head and asked softly, "Why do you ask this?"

"I used to live in the old district," Anna briefly narrated her past, "My father sold me to the church for 25 Gold royals. His Highness rescued me from that cage. Here, I am very happy."
"But you can't leave this castle. Apart from Roland Wimbledon, everyone else still hates witches."
"I don't mind. Besides, he said he would change all of this, didn't he?"
"That's difficult. As long as the church stands, witches will always be seen as evil."
Anna didn't refute, the silence seemed somewhat prolonged. Just when Nightingale thought she would never speak again, she suddenly asked, "Are you happier in the Witch Cooperation Association, or here?"
"You... What did you say?" Nightingale was caught off guard, "Of course, it is..."
The Witch Cooperation Association? To be honest, she wasn't particularly interested in finding the Holy Mountain, but she had friends there that she couldn't let go of.
Border Town? If it weren't for hearing that a witch was in danger, she wouldn't have come here at all!
The answer should be obvious, but why couldn't she say it immediately?

This time, Anna showed a smile. Nightingale seldom saw her smile, her eyes reflecting the dawn's light like a lake, inexplicably comforting—even if she wasn't in the "Mist." "I heard Roland say that you were looking for the Holy Mountain in the northern mountains. If the Holy Mountain signifies stability and belonging, I think I've already found it."
This was her Holy Mountain, Nightingale realized. Even though her life was nearing its end, her soul would reach the other side earlier than most witches. 
Just then, the sound of hurried footsteps came from outside the door. Listening closely, Nightingale realized it sounded like Nana's footsteps. 
The door was pushed open, and as expected, it was Nana Pine who rushed in. 
She threw herself into Anna's arms with a tear-streaked face. "What... what do I do? Sister Anna, my father discovered that I'm a witch!"
