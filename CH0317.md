## "Ice Coffin"
Lightning felt goosebumps all over her body.

She immediately remembered the stories that circulated among explorers—the demons crawling out of the abyss, the resentful spirits that died with grievances, or the undead that lingered on. All of them were the nightmares of explorers; even making eye contact could snatch away one's life, and illusions and temptations were tricks they were adept at. Could it be that such monsters were also hidden in these ruins?

Although Thunder said these stories were nothing but nonsensical tales made up by third-rate explorers, she still felt a tremor in her heart at this moment. Otherwise, who could still be shouting inside for months on end, under the siege of devils, without the tone and intervals of the cries ever changing?

She now faced a dilemma—if it really was a legendary evil being, and she killed all the devils, barging in might still spell doom for her. But if the other party had truly persisted until now, then the devils should still be inside the ruins. What should she do?

After hesitating for a moment, she decided to fly back and discuss it with Maggie.

After briefly explaining the situation, Maggie said with her head held high, "We can extinguish the torches and sneak in quietly, coo. That way, the devils won't see us."

"Uh, but then we won't be able to see them either."

"I can turn into an owl," cooed the pigeon, rubbing her face, "Even the darkest night won't trouble me, coo."

Lightning's eyes lit up, "That's a good idea, but... those legendary evil beings have lived in the dark all their lives, they must have a way to find their prey, right? Otherwise, they would have starved to death long ago."



"You said that they were all made up to scare people, didn't you?" 

"Not me, my dad," the little girl corrected. 

"It's all the same, I've never heard of any undying monsters in Greycastle, gah. If they were really that terrifying, they shouldn't just be staying in that small area of the Fjords, right?" Maggie emitted a ray of light, and the pigeon suddenly swelled, turning into a grey-brown owl, its eyes full of eagerness to try, "I thought you would be interested in these legends." 

Right, if she were a qualified explorer, she would never miss a chance to verify the legends. Moreover, she had her own mental barriers to overcome, and fleeing now would mean all her previous efforts were in vain. Hesitating for a moment, Lightning decided to do as Maggie suggested. 

But wait... She came here to overcome her fears, so why was the other party so interested in exploring the ruins? Could it be...

"You're not in such a hurry just for that basket of eggs, are you?" 

The owl blinked its round, big eyes and turned its head away. 

...

Once again standing at the entrance of the basement, Lightning took several deep breaths, held the revolver tightly in her hand, and quietly walked into the deep darkness.



Perhaps it was because Maggie was perched on her shoulder that she felt much calmer than before.

The touch of the ground was damp, and from time to time she would encounter a puddle. This place was situated at a low elevation, and the rainwater that drifted into the tower would slowly gather and flow downwards. Although generally, basements are equipped with a drainage ditch, after hundreds of years of exposure to wind and rain, these ditches were probably clogged to a great extent.



Maggie flapped her wings against her head, indicating that there was a staircase leading downward ahead.



Lightning slowed her pace, carefully probing the edge of the staircase step by step and then carefully descending. After turning a corner, she suddenly saw light.



The soft pale yellow light came from the end of the staircase, spilling onto the ground and reflecting shimmering ripples.



After careful observation, she realized that the slightly shaking ground was actually a pool of sewage water. Judging by the half-submerged door frame, the water at the bottom of the basement was probably deep enough to reach above the knees.



She carefully walked to the point where the staircase met the water surface, lifted off the ground, and floated slowly to the side of the door, peering inside.



Inside the door was a vast emptiness—the underground space of the stone tower was so large it was almost inconceivable, far exceeding the above-ground part. She did not see a burning torch; the yellow light came from the stones embedded in the walls. They roughly outlined the contours of the basement and also allowed Lightning to see everything in the room.



In the center of the room stood a stone platform with several figures on it. From their backs' shells and burly figures, it was clear that they were undoubtedly demons. Fortunately, the enemy had not yet noticed the movement by the door. They were holding long spears and large shields, surrounding a square blue stone pillar.



At this moment, the cries for help became clearer and clearer, as if they were ringing in her ears.

"Save me, save me..."



Lightning swallowed, what should she do next?

"We..."



"Go save her, coo." Maggie whispered in her ear.



"Eh?" The little girl was taken aback, "But there are several devils over there... We can't possibly beat them!" She felt her palm sweating around the grip of the gun, "If Sister Nightingale were here, it would definitely be no problem, but I can't do it alone..."



"Are those the devils you're talking about?" Maggie tilted her head, "They seem to be already dead, coo."



"What, dead?"



Before her words ended, Maggie had already taken off into the sky, flying towards the platform, startling Lightning so much that she froze on the spot, even forgetting to reach out to grab her. By the time she reacted, Maggie had already pounced on one of the devils, and Lightning had no choice but to grit her teeth, raise her gun, and follow, silently reciting the shooting principles taught by Nightingale.



A surprising scene unfolded before them—the devil, after being pecked twice by the owl, collapsed with a thunderous crash, turning into a pile of ash as if it were a weathered, crumbling stone.



What... what just happened? Lightning landed beside Maggie, looking in astonishment at the other three devils.



Under the yellow glow, their bodies were covered with tiny cracks, and there were traces of spiderwebs between their legs. Through the ferocious masks they wore, one could see their eyeballs and skin had turned grayish-white, completely devoid of any signs of life. That's it, she thought. The owl's vision in dim light was several times better than her own, which was why Maggie had said those words.



However, before she could relax, Lightning's attention was completely captured by something else.



In the center of the high platform surrounded by devils stood a huge cube that looked like a stone pillar from afar, but upon closer inspection, it was transparent. Encased within the cubic crystal was a woman dressed in a splendid robe, her eyes closed, hands outstretched, with blue hair flowing backward as if still blowing in the wind.



"Is this a witch, coo?" Maggie flew above the crystal and pecked fiercely, but instead of shattering, it made a clear tapping sound, "So hard, coo!"



"I don't know," Lightning muttered. She placed her hand on the crystal, feeling the icy chill through her skin—the crystal's surface was covered with a thick layer of dust, apparently, the woman had been in this "stone coffin" for a very long time. Her expression was lifelike, with furrowed brows lifted upwards, appearing somewhat panicked, but even more so, anxious and worried.



"Save me..."



The voice came from behind the crystal once again.
