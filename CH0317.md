## "Ice Coffin"
Lightning felt goosebumps all over her body.

She immediately thought of the stories that circulated among the explorers—demons crawling out of the abyss, resentful ghosts meeting their end, or undead that lingered on. Each one was a nightmare for explorers, able to claim lives with just a glance. Illusions and temptations were their forte. Could such monsters be hidden within these ruins?

Although Thunder had said these stories were nothing more than tall tales made up by third-rate explorers, she still felt a tremor of fear in her heart. Otherwise, who could still be shouting inside for months under the siege of devils, without even a change in tone or interval?

She now faced a dilemma—if these were indeed the legendary evil beings and she had killed all the devils, rashly breaking in seemed to spell doom. But if the other party really had persisted until now, then the devils might still be within the ruins. What should she do?

After hesitating for a moment, she decided to fly back and discuss it with Maggie.

After briefly explaining the situation, Maggie raised her head and said, "We can extinguish the torches and sneak in quietly, coo. That way, the devils won't be able to see us."

"Uh, but we won't be able to see them either."

"I can turn into an owl," the pigeon rubbed against her face and cooed, "Even the darkest night cannot hinder me, coo."

Lightning's eyes lit up, "That's a good idea, but... those legendary evil creatures have lived in darkness all their lives, they must have a way to find their prey, right? Otherwise, they would have starved to death long ago."



"You said they were all made up by others to scare people, didn't you?"

"Not me, it was my dad," the little girl corrected.

"It's all the same, I've never heard of any undead monsters in Greycastle, gah. If they were really that terrifying, they shouldn't just stay in that small area of the Fjords, right?" A glow emanated from Maggie, and the pigeon suddenly puffed up, transforming into a grey-brown owl with eager eyes. "I thought you'd be interested in these legends."

Yeah, a qualified explorer would never miss an opportunity to verify a legend. Moreover, she had her own mental barriers to overcome, and running away now would mean all her previous efforts were wasted. Lightning hesitated for a moment, then decided to do as Maggie suggested.

But, wait... She came here to overcome her fears, so why was the other so interested in exploring the ruins? Could it be...

"You're not in such a hurry just for that basket of eggs, are you?"

The owl blinked its round, big eyes and turned its head away.

...

Standing once again at the entrance of the basement, Lightning took several deep breaths, gripped her revolver tightly in her hand, and tiptoed into the profound darkness ahead.



It was probably because of Maggie squatting on her shoulder that she felt much calmer than before. 

The touch of the ground was moist, and every now and then there would be a puddle of water. This place was located at a lower terrain, where rainwater falling into the tower would slowly gather and drain downwards. Although most basements are equipped with hidden drainage channels, after hundreds of years of exposure to the elements, these channels are probably mostly clogged up. 

Maggie flapped her wings against her head, indicating that there was a staircase leading downwards ahead.

Lightning slowed her steps, carefully probing the edge of the staircase before cautiously descending step by step. After turning a corner, she suddenly saw a light.

Soft pale yellow light filtered through from the end of the staircase, spilling onto the ground and reflecting shimmering ripples.

After a careful examination, she realized that the slightly shaking ground was actually a pool of sewage. Judging by the half-submerged doorframe, the water accumulated at the bottom of the basement was probably deep enough to cover the knees.

She carefully walked to the junction of the staircase and the water's surface, lifted her feet off the ground, and slowly floated to the side of the door, peering inside.

She saw an open space inside the door—it was somewhat unbelievable how large the underground space of this stone tower was, far exceeding the part above the ground. She did not see a burning torch; the yellow light came from stones embedded in the walls. These stones roughly outlined the contours of the basement while also allowing Lightning to see everything in the room.

There was a stone platform in the center of the room, on which stood several figures. From the shells on their backs and their burly figures, it was clear that they were Devils without a doubt. Fortunately, the enemy had not yet noticed the movement at the door. They were holding long spears and large shields, surrounding a square blue stone pillar.



At this moment, the cries for help became clearer and clearer, as if they were ringing in her ears.

"Save me, save me..."

Lightning swallowed hard. What should she do next?

"We..."

"Go save her, coo," Maggie whispered in her ear.

"Eh?" The little girl was stunned. "But there are several devils there... We can't possibly beat them!" Her palms were sweaty around the grip of her gun. "If Nightingale were here, there would be no problem, but by myself... I can't do it."

"Is that what you called devils?" Maggie tilted her head. "They seem to be already dead, coo."

"What, dead?"

Before her words fell, Maggie had already taken to the air, flying towards the platform, startling Lightning so much that she was frozen on the spot, even forgetting to reach out and grab her. By the time she reacted, Maggie had already pounced on one of the devils, and Lightning had no choice but to grit her teeth, raise her gun, and follow, silently reciting the shooting principles taught by Nightingale.



A surprising scene unfolded: the demon, after being pecked twice by the owl, collapsed with a loud bang, like a weathered, broken stone, turning into a pile of ash in the blink of an eye.

What... what just happened? Lightning landed beside Maggie, looking at the other three demons in astonishment.

Illuminated by the yellow light, their bodies were covered in fine cracks, with traces of spider webs between their legs. Through their ferocious masks, one could see their eyes and skin were gray-white, completely devoid of any sign of life. That's it, she thought; under the dim light, the owl's vision was several times better than her own, which is why Maggie had made that remark.

But before she could relax, Lightning's gaze was drawn to something else entirely.

In the center of the elevated platform surrounded by demons stood a huge cube, which at a distance looked like a stone pillar, but upon closer inspection was found to be transparent. Encased within the cubic crystal was a woman dressed in a lavish robe, her eyes tightly closed, hands spread open, with blue hair flowing backward as if still fluttering in the wind.

"Is this a witch, coo?" Maggie flew above the crystal and pecked vigorously, but this time it did not shatter; instead, it made a clear knocking sound. "So hard, coo!"

"I don't know," murmured Lightning, placing her hand on the crystal. A cold chill passed through her skin—the crystal's surface was covered with a thick layer of dust, indicating that the woman had been inside this "stone coffin" for a long time. Her expression was lifelike, with eyebrows furrowed and turned upwards, appearing somewhat panicked, but mostly filled with anxiety and concern.

"Save me..."

The voice came again from behind the crystal.
