## Gift of Vengeance (Part 2)
"Demon!" Alethea drew her greatsword, standing in front of Mira.



"...Demon?" Her tone was cold, almost devoid of emotion. "Then what are you, who transport orphans and abandoned infants to the monastery to be raised, selecting witches from among them?"



"What nonsense are you spouting!" the female warrior rebuked, "The Church takes them in out of God's mercy. Without the monastery, how many of them could survive to adulthood? Yet the devil that infiltrates everywhere always corrupts those among them with weak wills, leading the very few astray. Once someone is found to have fallen into witchcraft, the Church will deal with them immediately. You're completely reversing cause and effect!"



Hearing the word "deal", the witch's golden pupils dimmed significantly. She raised her greatsword with one hand, "I'm not particularly interested in persuading a dead person. Let's end this."



Before her words had even finished, the owl took flight, and her figure had already charged forward. Alethea vividly remembered the horrible state of the teammate who had been split in half, sword and all. Instead of retreating, she lunged towards the Extraordinary's lower right side—a spot that was often mentioned in swordsmanship training as the most difficult to defend for a right-handed person due to the limitations of the sword-holding position, requiring an extra half-moment to change the direction of the blade.



Like a leopard pouncing, Alethea avoided the witch's vertical slash and tried to counterattack by sweeping her greatsword horizontally as she passed by the opponent's side. However, the Extraordinary's response was astoundingly quick—a light hop easily dodged the sweep, and she turned and lifted her greatsword.



At that moment, Alethea hadn't even completely landed.



Everything happened in the blink of an eye; the lower half of her leg flew into the air along with the blood. The tearing pain from below was almost enough to make her lose consciousness. Only by clenching her teeth did the female warrior manage not to scream out loud.



The gap was too wide.



Now she understood how formidable Abram was, being able to cross swords with an Extraordinary for more than a dozen moves, buying time for her to escape.



Alethea struggled to turn over and just happened to see Mira pulling a hand crossbow from her back wrap, raising her hand to aim at the Extraordinary witch who had focused her attention on herself.



This was the last chance, she realized, maybe she could draw her attention!



The female warrior was about to say something when the great sword swept through like a whirlwind. She felt a tightness in her throat, then the world turned upside down... No, perhaps she was flying up, she saw her body weakly kneeling down, and at the same time, she saw an owl fiercely pouncing towards Mira, transforming into a girl in mid-air and heavily landing on the priestess... Her vision quickly blurred, and she finally fell to the ground, sinking into endless darkness.



...



"Damn this stone lump!" Maggie complained, touching the lump on her head, "You're too careless. If it weren't for me, that bolt would have hit you!"



"Don't worry, I noticed, I just planned to make it quick," Ashes said as she swiftly dug a shallow pit with her great sword, dragging both of them into it before covering them with earth. She pocketed the God's Punishment Stones and Gold Royals, securing their travel expenses to Clearwater Harbor. She also found a letter on the woman dressed in priestess robes, briefly skimming through it. The gist was that if the Western Region Lord, Roland Wimbledon, was not in collusion with witches, then a request was made to him to purchase female infants and orphans—the other party to this deal before had been Duke Lion. All underage females were within the purchasing range, payments could be made at 'market price,' or pills could be offered as payment.



After reading, Ashes let out a cold laugh, placed the letter on a torch, and burned it to ashes.



"Let's go, we still have a bunch of bodies to bury."



"Coo." Maggie turned back into an owl and rushed towards the first attack site with Ashes.



Digging holes, moving, and burying bodies... Maggie couldn't help much with these physical tasks. Moreover, the severed limbs and the pervasive stench of blood made her feel a bit dizzy, so she could only perch on a branch and watch Ashes busily moving about.



"Why are you doing this? Won't it be bad if the Church discovers it?"



"By the time they notice that the Messenger Group has disappeared, two or three months will have passed," Ashes said while shoveling the earth. "Normally, when the Church sends out a Messenger Group to investigate witch incidents, if the local lord cooperates, it can last over a month. Including their return journey, it's about two or three months."



"But His Highness the Prince definitely won't cooperate with them! Coo!"



"You better turn back into a human form before you talk to me," Ashes sighed. "If the lord allows the Messenger Group to enter the town, the witches from the Union will be exposed—the Messenger Group doesn't need to question the Prince himself, they only need to capture and torture the townspeople to get the answers. Roland has to either betray the witches, claiming all this has nothing to do with him, or he will have to capture them all. If they are prepared in advance, as long as one escapes, Hermes will soon receive the message—you've seen it too, they were carrying carrier pigeons with them."



"Pigeons can't see the road at night; I've already caught them all," Maggie patted her bulging belt pouch. "When roasted tomorrow, we'll have one each."



Ashes shook her head secretly. She had never seen Maggie catch birds to eat before. Having been in Border Town for only a few days, she had already developed a keen interest in roasted bird meat. "If the Church decides to deploy its army, it would leave him with only about a month's time. But as long as we're not too unlucky, he could have at least three more months... So, this is my gift to him, as well as my revenge on the Church."



"I see, that's worthy of Ashes," Maggie praised.



Ashes did not reveal everything, thereby effectively making the decision on behalf of the prince. Once the Church realizes that the delegation has lost contact, they will undoubtedly blame Roland Wimbledon. By then, even if he wanted to betray the witches, he would no longer have the chance.



Everything was settled by the time the sky was beginning to lighten.



"So, this is where we part ways," Ashes said.



"..." Maggie was taken aback. "What?"



Ashes patted the little head and crouched down. "You like Border Town, don't you? With Lightning and Wendy here, you're sure to be happy."



"But..." the other lowered her head, looking hesitant, "I also like you and Lady Tilly."



"It's not about staying here forever," Ashes smiled, "Roland Wimbledon is different from Tilly. He's ultimately just a common noble and it's hard to guarantee that he will always stand with the witches. That's the task I want to give you. Fly back once a month, report what's happening in Border Town to us, and bring back news from the Witches' Cooperation Association. This way, we can establish a connection between the two sides. If the town faces any danger, you can also help them escape from Greycastle and head to the Fjords."



"Is that so?" Maggie blinked.



"That's right," she nodded, "I believe you can do it."



Seeing Maggie transform into a pigeon and gradually disappear into the dawn, Ashes turned over, mounted her horse, and headed towards Clearwater Harbor.
