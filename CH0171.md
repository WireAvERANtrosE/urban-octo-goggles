## Gift of Vengeance (Part 2)
"Demons!" Ashes drew her greatsword and stood in front of Scroll.

"Demons?" Her tone was cold, almost emotionless, "What then, are you, who transport orphans and abandoned infants to the church to be raised, selecting witches from among them?"

"What nonsense are you spouting!" The female knight rebuked, "The church takes them in out of the grace of God. Without the convent, how many of them could survive to adulthood? Yet the devil, who infiltrates everywhere, always corrupts those among them with weak wills, leading the very few astray. Once someone falls and becomes a witch, the church deals with them immediately. You're completely reversing cause and effect!"

Hearing the word "deal," the witch's golden pupils dimmed considerably. She raised her greatsword with one hand, "I am not particularly interested in persuading a dead person, let's leave it at that."

Before her words had finished, the owl took flight, and her figure had already charged forward. Ashes vividly remembered the horrible condition of her comrade who had been split along with his sword, she did not retreat but instead advanced, pouncing towards the Extraordinary's lower right side—during swordsmanship training, the instructor had mentioned more than once that for those who are right-handed, the lower right side is the hardest to protect due to the sword stance, as it takes an extra half moment to turn the blade.

Ashes pounced like a leopard, avoiding the witch's direct slash. As she brushed past the opponent's side, she held her greatsword horizontally, attempting a counterattack. But the Extraordinary's reaction was astonishingly fast— with a light hop, she easily dodged the sweep and simultaneously spun around to lift her greatsword.

By this time, Ashes hadn't even completely landed.

Everything happened in the blink of an eye; half of her lower leg flew up with the blood. The tearing pain from below was almost enough to make her lose consciousness. By clenching her teeth out of instinct, the female knight managed not to cry out on the spot.

The gap was too great.



She now understood just how formidable Abrams was, being able to cross swords with an Extraordinary for a dozen moves, and buying time for her to escape.

Ashes struggled to roll over, and just happened to see that Mira was taking a hand crossbow from her back wrap, raising it to aim at the Extraordinary witch who was focused on her.

This was the last chance, she realized, perhaps she could attract her attention!

The female warrior was about to say something when the great sword swept over like a whirlwind. She felt a tightness in her throat, and then the world turned upside down... No, perhaps she was the one being flung into the air, she saw her own body falling powerlessly to her knees, and at the same time, she saw an owl swooping down on Mira, which turned into a girl in mid-air and crashed hard onto the priestess... Her vision quickly blurred, and she finally fell to the ground, plunging into endless darkness.



...



"Damn this stone, coo!" Maggie touched the lump on her head, complaining, "You were too careless, without me, that crossbow bolt would have hit you!"

"Don't worry, I noticed it, I was just planning to make it a quick battle," Ashes said as she swiftly dug a shallow pit with her great sword, dragging both of them into the pit before covering it with soil. She pocketed the Divine Stone of Judgement and the Gold royals, with that, they had the fare to head towards Clearwater port. She also found a letter on the woman dressed in a priestess's robe, after a quick glance, it appeared to be a request to purchase baby girls and orphans if the Western lord, Roland Wimbledon, was not in collusion with witches - before this, the other party to the transaction was Duke Ryan. Any underage females were within the purchase scope, payment could be made at 'market price', or pills could be used as compensation.

After reading, Ashes let out a cold laugh, placed the letter onto the torch, and burned it to ashes.

"Let's go, we still have a bunch of bodies to bury."



"Hoot." Maggie transformed back into an owl and hurried to the first attack site with ashes.



Digging holes, carrying, burying people... Maggie couldn't help much with these physical tasks, and the sight of limbs and pervasive smell of blood made her feel dizzy, so she could only perch on a branch and watch Ashes bustling about.



"Why are you doing all this? Won't it be bad if the Church discovers it?"



"By the time they realize the messenger group has disappeared, it will also be two to three months later," Ashes said as she shoveled the soil. "Usually, when the Church sends a messenger group to investigate witch incidents, if the lord cooperates, it will continue for more than a month, plus their return trip, it's almost two to three months."



"But His Highness the Prince certainly won't cooperate with them! Hoot!"



"You'd better transform back into a human before talking to me," Ashes sighed. "If the lord allows the messenger group to enter the town, the witches of the Union will inevitably be exposed—the messenger group doesn't need to ask the prince himself, they just need to capture the serfs and interrogate them to find out the answers. Roland must either betray the witches, claiming that all this has nothing to do with himself, or he can only capture them all. If the other party is prepared in advance, as long as one escapes, Hermes will soon receive the message—you saw it, they even carry pigeons with them."



"Pigeons can't see the road at night, I've caught them all," Maggie patted her bulging waist bag, "when they're roasted tomorrow, we'll have one each."



Ashes shook her head secretly; she had never seen her eat birds before, but after only a few days in Border Town, she had developed a strong interest in roasted bird meat. "If the Church decides to deploy troops, that leaves him with only about a month. But now, as long as the luck isn't too bad, he could have three more months... So, this is my gift to him, and my revenge on the Church."



"I see, you're really something, Sister Ashes," Maggie praised.



There was one more thing that Ashes hadn't mentioned. By doing so, she was essentially making the decision for the prince. Once the church realized that they had lost contact with their envoy, they would definitely blame Roland Wimbledon. By then, even if he wanted to betray the witches, he wouldn't have the chance.

By the time everything was settled, dawn was already breaking.

"Then, this is where we part ways," Ashes said.

"..." Maggie was stunned for a moment. "What?"

She touched the other's small head and squatted down, "You like Border Town, don't you? With Lightning and Wendy, you will definitely be happy here."

"But..." The other lowered her head, looking hesitant. "I also like you and Lady Tilly."

"It's not about staying here forever," Ashes smiled. "Roland Wimbledon is different from Tilly; after all, he's just a common noble and it's hard to ensure he will always stand with the witches. That's the task I want to give you: fly back once a month to report what's happening in Border Town to us and bring back news to the witches of the Mutual Aid Society. This way, a connection can be established between the two sides. If the town faces danger, you can also help them escape Greycastle and head to the Fjords."

"Is that so?" Maggie blinked.

"That's right," she nodded. "I believe you can do it."



Seeing Maggie transform into a pigeon and gradually disappearing into the dawn, Ashes turned over, mounted her horse, and headed towards Clearwater Harbor.
