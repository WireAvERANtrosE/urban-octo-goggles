## Soul Shackles
Moonlight spilled through the windows between the corridors, illuminating half of the woman's face, her eyes reflecting a faint blue glow, like stars in the darkness. Anna leaned against the door, mostly shrouded in shadow, but her silhouette was still faintly visible—good nutrition had left her far from the emaciated figure she was at first. As a woman who had just come of age, her figure was just right, embodying the unique youthful charm of her age.



Roland put on a calm facade and slowly approached. She saw him too, straightened up, and met his gaze.



"It was just an accident, I didn't know she would—" he began.



"I understand."



"She's still young, I never took it to heart—"



"I understand that too."



Contrary to what Roland had anticipated, Anna was not acting petulant. There was not a trace of displeasure on her face, but rather a serious demeanor. Her lake-blue eyes did not ripple in the slightest, and Roland realized that she was still the straightforward woman he knew. She disliked pretense and had no need for it. Indeed, she took the initiative to say, "I cannot do something so... bold in front of others like Lightning, so I had to wait here for you."



After she spoke, a blush was clearly visible on her cheeks, but even so, she did not back down, maintaining eye contact with Roland, her expression utterly serious.



Roland's heartbeat slowed for a moment. He wanted to say something, but at that moment, all words seemed superfluous. She might mind what Lightning had done, but feeling wronged or complaining was not her way. She would express her demands straightforwardly.



The earnest and diligent child should not be denied, he thought. Bending down, Roland pressed his cheek against Anna, her breath gently blowing like the spring wind that stirs the heartstrings. The slightly tense breathing was clearly audible in the quiet corridor, followed by a soft pair of lips lightly pressing against Roland's cheek.

"Goodnight, Your Highness," Anna whispered softly.

...

Wendy was sitting on the bed, flipping through a book in her hand.

This was a rare leisure time for her, a life she had not even dared to dream of during her time with the Witch Cooperation Association.

Not long after coming to the town, she developed such a habit: washing herself clean before bed, putting on a silk robe without tying the waistband or buttoning up, sitting cross-legged on the bed with a soft pillow propped against her lower back, and reading books borrowed from His Highness.

Today, it took quite some time to settle Lightning, so she decided not to go back to the backyard garden and went straight to bed after washing up.

It was a history book about the origin of the church.

Although she grew up in a monastery, she didn't know much about this area. The nuns repeatedly admonished them to heed God's teachings, but never mentioned God's name—which puzzled her as a child. Everyone has a name, so why doesn't the most noble deity have one?



The records in the book were basically the same as the rumors she heard later. Initially, there were three major churches on the continent, each considering the others as heretics worshipping evil gods. This war of faith lasted for nearly a hundred years, and in the end, the current church emerged victorious, proclaiming that the evil gods had been vanquished. Henceforth, there would be only one name for God, and that was the word "God" itself.



The subsequent passages were all about the glory and immortality of the church, including the establishment of the old Holy City and the new Holy City, as well as the victories achieved over the evil witches who caused chaos. This made Wendy feel very strange; she had borrowed "The History of Greycastle" and "A Brief History of the Continent" from His Highness Roland. The former recorded in great detail the establishment, development, and significant events of the kingdom. For example, the names of each king, their marital status, and the whereabouts of their children. The family branches recorded in the biographical section were like an extensive genealogy.



"A Brief History of the Continent," on the other hand, focused on the evolution of the four major kingdoms, the alternation of power, and political struggles, but the life stories of the rulers of each kingdom were still an important part of the record.



However, in the church's history books, there was no mention of the names of any of the popes. Or rather, just like with God, the word "pope" was used to replace the names of all the leaders. Reading through it, it seemed as if one person had spanned hundreds of years of history. This simply did not make sense. Rather than recording, it was more like a deliberate downplaying.



At this moment, Nightingale suddenly appeared in the room. Wendy put down the book, looking at her with interest: "It's so late, and you still have time to come to me?"



Nightingale rubbed her neck and sat down by the bed, "I just sent Nana home. Where is Lightning?"



"She fell asleep as soon as she hit the bed, and kept muttering 'Daddy, Daddy,'" Wendy shrugged, "Usually she seems so bold and fearless, but she's still a child, isn't she?"



"In your eyes, everyone is a child," Nightingale snatched the book from her hands, "His Highness has said it before, try not to read at night, especially in bed. Reading with insufficient light is harmful to your eyesight."



"Yes, yes, as His Highness says."



The two chatted leisurely for a while, talking about everything from Silver City to the Impassable Mountain Range, from hearing about the witch's murder in the sleeping town to joining hands with the prince to combat the Evil Months. Nightingale was speaking intermittently, while Wendy chimed in from time to time. This was the tacit understanding formed by their inseparable companionship over the past five years. Time flowed slowly until the candle was about to go out, and then Wendy covered her mouth and laughed, "What's the matter? Can't sleep after seeing Lightning's actions?"

"What are you talking about..."

"What else could it be?" Wendy shook her head with a smile, "Veronica, we're witches, you should know that."

Nightingale fell silent, and after a long time, she replied softly, "Mhm."

This is fate, the unavoidable destiny of all witches. Wendy's smile faded, and she sighed lightly, "Roland Wimbledon is the fourth prince of the kingdom, and our duty is to help him ascend to the throne and become the King of Greycastle. He will govern the country well and provide a haven for our sisters."

"But ultimately, he is a king. When the time is ripe, he will marry a duke's daughter or a princess from another kingdom, and then he will have offspring. Perhaps one, or perhaps many; boys or girls. The boys will inherit the country, and the girls will marry into other illustrious noble families."

Wendy paused for a moment, then said the words that Nightingale, or any witch for that matter, did not want to hear, "Veronica, we are witches, and witches cannot bear children."

"Even if we're optimistic and, after a hundred years of His Highness's rule, sisters can finally walk freely on every piece of land in the kingdom just like ordinary people, occasionally some outstanding witches might enter the upper echelons and be ennobled. But the fact that witches cannot bear children remains unchanged. They won't have descendants to continue the family's glory, likewise, those noble families won't consider marrying a witch. Heaven has given us some things, and at the same time, it has taken some things away. This is fate." She spoke softly, "May you be merciful."

"I understand," she said in a low voice.



...

After seeing Nightingale off, Wendy also felt uneasy, but she believed the other could pull through. After all, they had overcome so many obstacles together, they wouldn't easily falter at this one.

She believed so firmly.
