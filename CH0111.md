## Battle of Stronghold (Part 2)
The first batch of Free Folk acting as cannon fodder encountered no resistance and had already successfully climbed up the earthen ramp.

The wooden fence, set at an angle to the slope and slanted towards the sky, blocked their steps. The fence was not tightly sealed, but rather, it had gaps large enough for long spears to pass through. When the attackers started to break the logs, the defending soldiers only needed to stand behind the fence to kill their opponents with spears.

However, Duke Fern was somewhat surprised that the people who were originally on the city walls had also disappeared without a trace, leaving the entire perimeter currently undefended. The vanguard quickly chopped open several breaches with hatchets, and after knocking down a few logs, the crowd surged onto the battlements. In no time at all, the wooden city gate was also lowered.

"Let's go," the Duke flicked his reins and led the remaining troops towards the city gate. From the start of the siege to the lowering of the city gate, less than half an hour had passed. What trick was Grace of Wimbledon playing? Duke Fern frowned—anyone with a bit of combat experience knew that when abandoning a city, one must leave behind a group of personal guards or hire daring mercenaries who were not afraid to die, to hold back the enemy's onslaught on the city walls, buying as much time as possible for the main force to retreat.

The Third Princess was not a foolish person; otherwise, she wouldn't have been able to make the entire Southern Territory switch allegiances to her so swiftly. Why hadn't she arranged for a group of her subordinates to defend the walls? Without people to operate them, the sturdiest defenses and the cleverest traps would only become inanimate objects. Duke Fern thought for a moment and decided to let his personal guard enter the city first to scout the situation.

The report from the captain of the guard was still the same—no resistance was encountered inside the city, although some streets were indeed blocked with wood and bricks. His subordinates were already gathering the local populace to clear the obstacles.

Duke Fern no longer hesitated and led the remaining troops into Eagle City. He considered himself a veteran who had followed King Wimbledon III in many campaigns and couldn't be fooled by a young girl. However, Timothy had made a slight miscalculation—if he could have waited until the Duke had taken the city gate and passed directly through, it would have saved quite a bit of time.

As he passed through the city gate, the Duke smelled a pungent odor, not the usual stench of rotting corpses on the battlefield, but a mixture similar to pine oil, orange peels, and incense. If one took a deep breath, it even felt somewhat fragrant.

What was this smell? He looked around but saw nothing unusual. The drainage ditches for the earthen walls were blocked, and sewage overflowed, slowly trickling along the ground. The filthy accumulations, which seemed to have been neglected for a long time, were dark and messy, reflecting iridescent patterns under the sunshine.



It's probably the smell of this pile of sewage, Iron Axe shook his head and led the team towards the castle district.



Since Eagle City had been taken, it was natural to take a tour of the lord's castle and the city hall to see if there was anything worth taking away. Of course, the city might have already been scavenged by Grace, and the gold royals might not be left behind, but some larger crafts and decorations were also very suitable as spoils of war. The grain transport wagons he brought could be cleaned up a little and used to load the loot. As for those mercenaries, they were probably heading towards the shops and farms by now.



Who cares about them, Duke Joey is already dead, and it's still a question of who the next successor will be. It's more urgent to loot the city completely at this moment.



After touring the lord's castle, Iron Axe Fran noticed something was off.



The castle was too empty, he thought. Not just the coins, but even the basement was devoid of cloth and grain. In several places where paintings had once hung, only blank walls remained, not a single book was left in the bookcases, and even the lord's bedroom bed had vanished. The entire castle was as if it had been stripped bare.



Could this be done in the haste of a retreat? Iron Axe felt uneasy. If these items hadn't been moved out slowly from the start, it wouldn't be possible for the castle to be so thoroughly scavenged.



Just as he was thinking about checking the city hall, a thick plume of black smoke suddenly rose from the northern gate.



"What's going on, is there a fire?"



"I don't know, my lord, I've already sent Molly to check," the captain of the guard said. "Perhaps it's the enemy deliberately setting fires."



Indeed, Duke first thought of traps, but he quickly realized that the method of using fire to seal the doors was meaningless. Not to mention that one could simply bypass the city gate and climb out from the earthen slope, just setting a fire without attacking in the chaos would allow an organized team to quickly extinguish the source of the fire.



The correct use would be to station troops inside the city, waiting until fires break out everywhere, and then launch a surprise attack while the enemy army is in panic and disarray. This move can effectively disrupt the enemy's formation and even force the opponent to retreat. As he said, a trap without someone operating it is nothing more than a dead object.



At this moment, black smoke began to rise from the other three gates, and the northern gate was already visible with flames that were rapidly expanding, as if it were piled with straw. The screams of civilians came from inside the city; it seemed that someone's house had caught fire.



This is not right... Duke thought, he had entered through the northern gate himself, where there was nothing that could catch fire, but an empty space! But if there was nothing to ignite, how could the fire spread so fast? Wait... A thought suddenly flashed through his mind, could it be that Grace Wimbledon had secretly recruited witches?



Duke touched the God's Punishment Stone hanging around his neck, feeling slightly reassured. If it were witch's fire, he could simply walk through it without harm; the flames of the demonic could not hurt him at all. Moreover, every member of his personal guards wore this thing, so it could not pose much of a threat. As for those commoners who had no money to donate to the church, Duke could no longer care about them at this moment.



This city was somewhat evil, he decided it was better to get out first. The army could camp at the southern gate, which would allow them to monitor Eagle City and also respond to the cavalry of the new king's return. Thinking this, he ordered the captain of the guards, "We will leave the city from the south side, blow the assembly call on the way, and gather the troops."



"Understood!"



Everyone immediately set off, but when they approached the southern gate, they found that the flames had already reached the urban area, and whole blocks of residences were ignited. The heat wave forced them to keep retreating. The city dwellers who had originally hid in their houses and refused to come out were now running out, and the streets were filled with people. Even the swords of the personal guards could not stop them from frantically fleeing to the unburned open spaces. For a time, everyone seemed to be trapped in a sea of fire, surrounded by thick smoke and fierce flames.



"Stay calm! Go find a well, draw water to put out the fire," Duke quickly issued a series of commands, "Don't worry about the houses, just douse the burning obstacles on the streets to clear a path. Do not stop the assembly call either, let others know our location!"



"Lord Duke!" a knight ran from the direction of the city center, and before even stopping his horse, he flipped off the saddle and landed on the ground—it was Molly, who had previously been sent to the North Gate by the Captain of the Guard. "My Lord, the fire at the North Gate simply cannot be extinguished!"



"What did you say?" Iron Axe asked in surprise, "It cannot be extinguished?"



"The flames are burning on that black liquid," she said rapidly, "not only does water not put it out, it even flows along with the current! My Lord, now the entire northern district is on fire!"



"Inextinguishable flames..." he murmured, "Yes, it seems to be devil's fire." Then the Duke shouted loudly, "Everyone, do not panic, this is the devil's fire cast by Grace using the evil witches! As long as you wear the God's Punishment Stones, the flames may seem terrifying, but they cannot burn you at all!"



"I see, may you be merciful," Molly subconsciously touched her chest, "Then, my Lord, what should we do?"



"What's there to fear with God's Punishment Stones! Everyone, mount up, we'll charge through," the Duke waved his hand, "This devil's fire will naturally disappear without a trace once it meets the God's Stones!" He paused, "Molly, you lead a group out first, I'll stay here to gather the people who are following behind."



"Yes!" The knight nodded, "Take care, my Lord. Everyone else, keep up!"



After that, she mounted her horse and without hesitation charged towards the burning end of the street.
