Border Town's second recruitment went much smoother than the first, thanks to the food distribution during winter, which allowed militia members to receive more and better food. On the family visit day each week, many soldiers would secretly pass on the bread and jerky they had saved to their relatives. Roland ordered Carter and Iron Axe not to interfere in this matter, and the relatives joyously took the food home, spreading the word to their neighbors.



An army composed of the people themselves served as an excellent example for propaganda, with word of mouth among neighbors proving far more effective than any deliberate publicity by the town hall. Now, most people in the old district of the town were aware that the militia set up by His Highness not only offered generous salaries, but also provided three meals a day and seemed to face less danger in the fight against the demonic beasts. As a result, during the second recruitment, the number of applicants from the old district greatly increased, and even residents from the new district came to enlist.



The number of qualified applicants was far higher than Roland had anticipated, so the second militia team expanded to two hundred people, with Carter leading the daily training. When the horn sounded, they would head to the city walls, standing by as a support force.



The Chief Knight and the Minister Assistant had raised objections to this, arguing that the first militia team was already capable of handling the defense against the demonic beasts. At this time, recruiting a second team, especially one twice the size of the first, seemed unnecessary. The higher than average food and salary allocations would lead to an increased burden on the financial expenses, without any apparent significant effect for the additional Gold royals spent.



However, Roland insisted on his decision.



Because these people were not being prepared to deal with the demonic beasts.



He did not dare to share the plan brewing in his mind with his subordinates just yet. Before the Duke made his move, he himself had already considered attacking Longsong Stronghold—such a thought, if expressed now, would likely be completely unacceptable to Carter and Barov.



Longsong Stronghold was different from Border Town. As the official frontier of the Kingdom of Greycastle, its walls stood ten meters tall, built brick by brick. The Duke and the six major families of the Western Territory were stationed in the inner city district, with an estimated thousand or more soldiers at their disposal. Theoretically, with his own militia of less than three hundred, it would be impossible to take down the stronghold in a siege battle—even with the era-transcending firearms.



And because of the existence of God's Stone of Retaliation, witches could not be used as a decapitation weapon; Roland had confirmed this repeatedly with Nightingale. Nobility as prominent as the Duke of Lion and the six major families would spare no effort in acquiring God's Stones of Retaliation—of course, outwardly, it was called a donation. These stones, which could be exchanged for several to dozens of Gold royals, could seal the abilities of witches within a certain range. They were claimed by the Church to be the most effective weapons against devils and also constituted their largest annual income.



Roland's only chance lay in field battles.



Thanks to the era, wars between lords were mostly fought through conscription. In order to prevent their forces from deserting halfway, lords would typically join the battle themselves, which gave Roland the opportunity to implement a battle of annihilation. However, he still had no clue on how to seize this opportunity. After all, his experience in luring the enemy and arranging formations came solely from films or historical stories, and he had never actually operated such tactics before.



Since he couldn't figure it out, he decided to focus on what he was good at, he thought.



Roland stretched and walked out of the office, heading alone to the wooden shed in the backyard.



The fully assembled Steam Engine No. 2 stood quietly in the center of the yard. At first glance, its appearance was much smoother than that of Steam Engine No. 1, with the traces of welds on the large components no longer uneven as before. This was the masterpiece of Anna's new ability; her green flame could penetrate into tiny gaps for welding, resulting in a more integral assembly of the large pieces than ever before.



In keeping with the development spirit that subsequent models are better than the initial models, and modified models are stronger than the subsequent ones, Steam Engine No. 2 had already been equipped with a centrifugal governor. As the first set of automatic control and feedback systems in human history, its emergence could be described as extraordinarily significant. The structure of the governor was very simple, consisting mainly of two hinged slender rods with iron balls welded to the ends and a rotating main rod. At first glance, it looked like the bamboo-copter that children often played with. Just by rapidly rubbing the bamboo stick, the two rotating blades would automatically rise due to the centrifugal force.



For the governor, the two iron balls were equivalent to the blades—when the steam engine operated, it would drive the main rod to rotate, and if the output was too high, the balls would spin faster, gradually rising under the influence of centrifugal force, pulling the rod to close the valve a little. When the output decreased, the balls' rotation would slow down, and under the influence of gravity, they would lower, thus opening the valve more. This kept the steam engine running at a relatively constant power.



With the governor, Steam Engine No. 2 was now capable of undertaking some more precise machining tasks.



And the gears that had previously been commissioned to various blacksmith shops had all been completed, now neatly arranged in a corner of the shed.



If one were to view these gears through the lens of industrial assembly line production, not a single one could be considered as a qualified work; they were all to be thrown into the defective goods bin, awaiting to be melted down and reworked. However, in this era, they were already considered rare works of art—the gears designed with involute curves naturally possessed a harmonious beauty, and the wheels exuded a unique metallic luster under the soaking of lard.



Apart from the gear assemblies, the bases and supports planed by the carpenters, as well as the other components, were all ready. Roland had the guards call Anna to begin assembling the first steam-powered boring machine.



In Roland's plan, this was the quickest route to mass-produce firearms.



Relying on blacksmiths to manually forge each gun barrel was extremely time-consuming and labor-intensive. With the boring machine, he only needed to cast iron rods and then directly drill holes with a boring cutter, producing more than a dozen barrels a day.



At the same time, by changing the cutter head, the boring machine could also be used to cut the rifling. The accuracy of the flintlock guns with rifling would be further improved.



With this, he was confident that before the end of winter, he could arm both militia squads, nearly three hundred men in total.



But Roland still couldn't guarantee that his subjects would be able to calmly load, aim, and shoot in the face of a knight's charge, instead of throwing down their weapons and fleeing. After all, these two squads had been established for too short a time and had no experience fighting others.



Therefore, he had to bring even more powerful firepower to the stage, to completely crush the enemy before they could even form a charge.



That was the cannon.



As the God of War in human warfare history, the lethality and deterrence of cannons were incomparable to that of firearms. A six-pound field gun had a range that was sufficient to initiate an attack while the enemy was still assembling. The mixed troops of this era could not maintain discipline under cannon fire; with just three or four field guns, the enemy wouldn't even have the chance to charge.



He had already made plans step by step—with the manual milling machine, gears that could withstand use could be processed, and with gears and the controllable-speed Steam Engine No. 2, he would be able to obtain a steam-powered boring mill. And with the steam boring mill, he could process various gun barrels and cannon barrels.



There were at least two more months before the end of the Evil Months. As long as the plans were implemented smoothly, the militia of Border Town would possess the strength to fully contend with the Duke's army.
