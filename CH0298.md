## Roland Wimbledon
"I understand." Roland lifted her by the waist and gently placed her on the bed, even this simple action made him gasp for breath. He pulled back the thin blanket, climbed into bed, and Anna snuggled up against him, resting her head on his arm.

What should come next... foreplay?

He found himself growing nervous as well, this wouldn't do. As a "seasoned" man, he couldn't show weakness in front of the young girl. Perhaps he needed to ease the mood with some light conversation before taking action, maybe... start with a dirty joke?

As he was racking his brain, Anna's soft voice came to his ear: "When you pushed me away on the hot air balloon, didn't you think that you might lose your life?"

Roland was stunned for a moment, not expecting her to ask this. "I just did it subconsciously."

"You are the future ruler of Greycastle and the hope of the witches," she whispered, "I'm not worth you doing that."

"It's not a matter of worth," Roland chuckled, "I couldn't just stand by and watch you be attacked without doing anything. In fact, after I woke up and thought it over, if things hadn't happened so suddenly, giving me time to think it through before deciding, I would still have done the same thing."

"There's no way I can stop you, right?"

"Uh, no." Roland pinched her nose with his other hand.



Anna's eyelashes drooped down, and after a moment of silence, she finally spoke, "Can you tell me about your past... I want to understand more."



"Uh, the past?" Roland exhaled, searching through the Fourth Prince's memories, ready to share some amusing stories from the palace, but then he swallowed his words. His past did not belong here but to another entirely different world, "I once lived in a big city, a very big one."



"Mm, the capital of Greycastle, much bigger than Border Town."



"I was no different from the average person after I was born, somewhat clever, but not exceptionally so. I studied hard, so I was often praised by my teachers, but they didn't know that those indelible doodles on the classroom walls were all drawn by me."



"Of course, he wouldn't dare to blame you," Anna murmured softly.



"Haha, that’s not true at all; he didn't need to do anything to me, just telling my parents was enough," Roland said with a laugh, shaking his head, "Back then, they would discipline me without holding back."



"And then, as I grew older, my teachers kept changing, from junior instructors to tutors, and I eventually completed all my studies with mediocre results. Of course, compared to other kids, I was still somewhat lacking..."



He half-closed his eyes, and narrated his experiences with a bit of embellishment, enjoying the kind of unguarded communication that he hadn't experienced for a long time. Ever since he came here, he had been playing the role of a prince, and now, he felt as if he had returned to the past, as if he were lying in an inn filled with classic charm, chatting with a girl he fancied, and his tense mood gradually relaxed.



Perhaps it was time to move on to the next step?



Roland slightly turned his head, only to find that Anna had already closed her eyes, her chest rising and falling gently against his side, like a cat fallen into a deep sleep.

He was slightly startled, then couldn't help but let out a chuckle.

So that was it... She was tired too.

Thinking about it, it made sense. To conceal their tracks, two nights ago, the witches had found a complicated and coiled place to hide in the mountains, and they had to be constantly on guard against wild beasts and devils attacking, hardly sleeping all night. As soon as dawn broke, they continued on towards Border Town aboard the Seagull. After returning to the castle, Anna had spent another night in his bedroom, without a moment's rest for two days and nights, making it very easy for the previously suppressed fatigue to burst forth. It would have been strange if she wasn't exhausted now.

Perhaps her decision to sleep had been made amidst an anxious and uneasy wait.

Although it was a bit of a pity, Roland didn't mind this time; there were still many days ahead.

He leaned in, kissed Anna's long eyelashes, and whispered, "Goodnight."

...

As the morning light seeped through the gaps in the curtains and into the room, Sylvie climbed out of the big bed, unable to suppress a few yawns.



The experiences of these past few days had been as incredible as a dream, from discovering the devil to the aerial skirmish, and finally fleeing all the way back to Border Town. She felt that even being pursued and blocked by the Church's Judgement Army wouldn't be as nerve-wracking and exhausting.



"Good morning." Wendy had already changed her clothes and was holding a basin of water, ready to wash up.



"Good morning," she nodded, "you're up early."



"I'm getting older," Wendy smiled, "and I find myself needing less sleep."



"Ah... Is it already daylight?" Nightingale rubbed her eyes, "It looks like I'll need to take a nap at noon today."



"Didn't sleep well last night?"



"Mm, I had a lot of dreams."



Sylvie pursed her lips dismissively. She had clearly seen the other party turn invisible and head to the third floor of the castle last night, even lingering in front of the lord's room for quite a while. However, due to Nightingale's special ability, she wasn't clear what she wanted to do; only that she returned very late. "Weren't you last night—"



Before she could finish speaking, Nightingale suddenly turned her head to look directly at Sylvie, her slightly narrowed eyes saying everything that needed to be said—Sylvie immediately shut her mouth. The strength of the number one combat witch from the Co-op was evident to all. The scene of her slicing through the devil in the air like a fleeting ghost remained vivid. Even on Sleeping Island, probably not even Ashes herself would be her match. Sylvie felt it was better not to be too curious about her silent warning.



"How was last night?" Wendy asked curiously.

"Cough cough," she began, "Last night I heard her snoring, it must be due to the exhaustion of these past few days."

"I think so too." Nightingale shrugged, slipped off her nightgown, revealing her well-proportioned and balanced body as she began to put on the personal clothing gifted by His Highness.

Speaking of which, even Wendy had completely accepted this garment, and was even showing a tendency to recommend it to others.

It's undeniable, Prince Roland is truly a fearsome person.

However, thinking of him now, a warmth surged in Sylvie's heart.

It turns out there really are nobles who would willingly get hurt for the sake of a witch.

Seeing Roland's figure as he threw himself in front of Anna, something touched the bottom of her heart. All the witches of the Witch Union were not tools manipulated by him, but his important subordinates, or even... companions. That instant reaction couldn't deceive anyone; he sincerely stood on the side of witches, just like Tilly Wimbledon.

If Roland could join hands with Tilly, uniting the forces of both regions, perhaps they could indeed create a new kingdom where witches and ordinary people are indistinguishable from each other.



She decided to write a letter to Lady Tilly.

"Prince Roland is your brother, that's really wonderful."
