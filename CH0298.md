## Roland Wimbleton
"I understand." Roland lifted her by the waist and gently placed her on the bed, even this simple action made him pant for breath. He pulled back the thin blanket, rolled onto the bed, and Anna moved closer to his side, resting her head on his arm.



What should come next... foreplay?



He found himself getting nervous as well; this wouldn't do. As a "seasoned" person of experience, he couldn't show timidity in front of the young girl. Perhaps he needed to use some casual conversation to lighten the mood before taking action, like... telling a dirty joke?



While he was racking his brains, Anna's soft voice sounded in his ear: "When you pushed me away on the hot-air balloon, didn't you think that you might lose your life?"



Roland was taken aback, not expecting her to ask this question, "I just did it subconsciously."



"You are the future ruler of Greycastle and the hope of the witches," she whispered, "I'm not worth you doing that."



"It's not a matter of worth," Roland chuckled lightly, "I couldn't just stand by and watch you be attacked. In fact, after I woke up, I thought it over carefully, and if things hadn't happened so suddenly, giving me time to think before making a decision, I would still have done the same."



"There's no way for me to stop you, right?"



"Mm, no." Roland pinched her nose with his other hand.



Anna's eyelashes drooped, and after a moment of silence, she spoke, "Can you tell me about your past stories... I want to understand more."



"Uh, the past?" Roland let out a breath. He searched through the memories of the Fourth Prince, ready to share a couple of amusing anecdotes from the palace, but then he swallowed his words. His past did not belong here; it was from an entirely different world, "I once lived in a big city, a very big one."



"Ah, the capital of Greycastle, much bigger than Border Town," she said.



"I was no different from an ordinary person after I was born, a bit clever, but not exceptionally so. I was diligent in my studies, so I was often praised by my teachers, but they didn't know that those indelible graffiti on the classroom walls were all done by me."



"He wouldn't dare blame you," Anna murmured softly.



"Haha, that wouldn't be the case. He didn't need to do anything to me, just telling my parents was enough," Roland shook his head with a smile, "Back then, they never went easy on me when it came to discipline."



"Then, as I grew older, my teachers kept changing, from primary instructors to tutors, and I finished all my studies with mediocre results. Of course, compared to other people's children, I was always a bit lacking..."



He half-closed his eyes and slowly narrated his experiences with a bit of embellishment. This kind of unguarded exchange, where he could speak freely without hiding anything, was something he hadn't felt in a long time. Since coming here, he had always been playing the role of a prince. But at this moment, he felt as if he had returned to the past, as if lying in an inn filled with classical charm, chatting about everyday life with a girl he fancied, his nervousness gradually easing.



Perhaps it was time to move on to the next step?



Roland slightly turned his head, only to find that Anna had already closed her eyes, her chest rising and falling gently against his side, like a cat deep in slumber.



He was momentarily stunned, then couldn't help but chuckle.



So that was it... she was tired too.



It made sense. To conceal their movements, the witches had hidden in the mountain ridges the night before last, constantly on guard against wild beasts and devils, almost going without sleep for the whole night. As soon as dawn broke, they continued their journey on the Seagull toward Border Town. After returning to the castle, Anna had stayed by his bedside for another night. With no rest for two days and nights, the accumulated fatigue was bound to hit hard once the tension relaxed. It would be surprising if she weren't exhausted.



Perhaps this decision of hers was also made amidst the anxious waiting.



Although it was a bit of a pity, Roland didn't mind this time. There were still many days ahead.



He moved closer and kissed Anna's long eyelashes, whispering, "Good night."



...



When the morning light seeped through the gaps in the curtains and into the room, Sylvie climbed out of the large bed, unable to suppress several yawns.



These days' experiences were as unbelievable as a dream, from discovering the devil to aerial skirmishes, and finally fleeing all the way back to Border Town. She felt that even being cornered and pursued by the Church's Judgement Army wouldn't be as nerve-wracking and exhausting.



"Good morning," Wendy had already changed her clothes and was holding a basin of water, ready to wash up.



"Morning," she nodded, "you're up early."



"I'm getting older," Wendy smiled, "and sleeping less and less."



"Ah... Is it daylight already?" Nightingale rubbed her eyes, "Seems like I need to catch up on some sleep this noon."



"Didn't sleep well last night?"



"Mhm, had a lot of dreams."



Sylvie pursed her lips dismissively. Last night, she clearly saw the other party turn invisible and head to the third floor of the castle, even lingering in front of His Lordship's room for a while. However, due to Nightingale's special ability, she was not aware of what she intended to do—just that she came back very late. "Weren't you last night..."



Before she could finish speaking, Nightingale suddenly turned her head to look directly at Sylvie, her slightly narrowed eyes conveying an unspoken warning—the latter immediately shut her mouth. The strength of this top combat witch from the Witch Union was evident to all, the sight of her ghostly figure cutting down devils in the air was still vivid in memory. If she were on Sleeping Island, perhaps even Lord Ashes would not be her match. Sylvie felt it was better not to be overly curious in response to her silent warning.



"How was last night?" Wendy asked curiously.



"Ahem," she began, "I heard her snoring last night, it must be due to the exhaustion over the past few days."



"I think so too." Nightingale shrugged, took off her sleeping robe, revealing her well-proportioned and harmonious body, and began to put on the personal underwear gifted by His Highness.



Speaking of which, even Wendy has now fully accepted this garment and even seems to have a tendency to recommend it to me.



It has to be said that Prince Roland is indeed a terrifying person.



However, at this moment, thinking of him, Sylvie felt a warmth in her heart.



It turns out that there really is a noble who would be willing to get hurt for the sake of a witch.



Seeing the figure of Roland pushing Anna out of harm's way with utter disregard for his own safety, she felt something inside her was touched. All the witches of the Union are not tools manipulated by him, but his important subordinates, or even… comrades. That instantaneous reaction cannot lie; he truly stands with the witches wholeheartedly, just like Tilly Wimbledon.



If Roland could join hands with Tilly, bringing together the strength of both regions, perhaps they could truly create a new kingdom where witches and ordinary people are indistinguishable from each other.



She decided to write a letter to Lady Tilly.

"Prince Roland is your brother, that's really wonderful."
