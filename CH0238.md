## How could I possibly have any regrets?
A week later, the First Army Expedition Team and the witches finally arrived at Border Town. Counting from the day of departure, the mission had taken almost half a month, which was five days longer than expected.



The main reason was that when the fleet set off on the return journey, the stronghold agent Peter Helmann sent a messenger to report an unexplained epidemic in Longsong Stronghold.



Since Roland had already given Peter a warning, when the epidemic was discovered, he took the best possible measures to isolate the area, sealing off that section of the city and sending a message to Border Town at the first opportunity.



After receiving the epidemic report, Roland sent Maggie to set off at full speed, following the Redwater River eastward to find the fleet carrying the First Army soldiers. He instructed them to divert at the fork of the Redwater River to Longsong Stronghold, to extinguish the evil plague before returning to the town.



Roland, leading the remaining members of the First Army and the families of the Expedition Team, welcomed their successful return at the dock. Accompanied by the familiar military march, the soldiers saluted the prince excitedly, with many imitating the knightly salute by kneeling on one knee and shouting long live. After disembarking, they embraced their loved ones tightly, while the cannons of Echo resounded in salute, creating an exceptionally lively atmosphere at the scene, attracting many serfs and refugees to watch.



Back at the castle, Iron Axe gave a complete report on the mission.



"You're saying that among the enemies who attacked the First Army this time, there were witches?" Roland pondered for a moment. "It's unlikely to be the people of the Rats."



"Theo also thinks so; he even believes that the Rats were directed by some other power, otherwise those scum rarely leave their nests. The ability to command the Rats and also have witches, apart from Timothy in the capital, only leaves the Church," Iron Axe said. "Even those great nobles can't come up with enough at once to make the largest underworld organization in the area take action."



"However, Timothy himself is in the Eastern Region, and considering the courage to send witches out to fight alone, I think the Church is more suspect," Roland thought of Wendy and Ashes' encounters, feeling it wouldn't be strange for the Church to have a group of secretly trained witches. "Are you sure she's dead?"



"Hit in the chest by Nightingale, her ribcage shattered," Iron Axe nodded. "We buried her in the wheat field, right where the body of the sentry soldier was found."

The troop of three hundred, on the last day, encountered a large-scale night raid by rats, ending in one dead and four wounded. The only casualty was still at the hands of an enemy witch. The four wounded were shot by hand crossbows when the enemies luckily got close. The continuous fire of the revolving rifles ended the battle before it could turn into close combat. The wounded were also properly bandaged, and upon returning to Border Town, they immediately received treatment from Nana—due to Lily's presence, the wounds were almost free from infection, and as long as the crossbow bolts did not hit any vital organs, the chances of a wounded soldier surviving after stopping the bleeding were extremely high.

All in all, the First Army's first long-range expedition was very satisfying to Roland. As for the enemy's infiltration, he did not know much about it, only that he needed to set up sentries to watch over each other, but how to do that specifically, he left to Iron Axe to figure out.

"You've worked hard. Tomorrow, I will hold a medal awarding ceremony, right in the town's central square. Go and inform all members of the First Army," he said.

After Iron Axe left, Roland let out a long sigh.

"Well done," he took out a bag of charcoal-grilled fish jerky from the drawer and placed it on the table. "If it weren't for you, they might have been in danger."

Nightingale appeared, smiling as she accepted the fish jerky, "I said before departure, leave everything to me."

"How strong was the opponent?"

"Agile and decisive, she must have undergone years of training. If it wasn't for my entering the Mist the moment she turned to resist, I might have actually gotten hit by the choking powder she threw." Nightingale shrugged, recounting the confrontation lightly, but he knew it all happened in the blink of an eye. "I didn't want to kill her... but when I saw the look in her eyes as she stabbed at Wendy, I understood that nothing but death would stop her."



"..." Roland fell silent for a moment, "Do you remember what you said to me after we defeated Timothy's militia and returned from the stronghold?"



Nightingale thought for a while, "'It's not your fault'?"



"Exactly," he nodded, "If she was a witch raised by the Church from a young age, only seeing you as traitors and degenerates, it would be very difficult to change her ingrained way of thinking after just a few years... At least, you saved the lives of Wendy and the others."



Nightingale laughed, "Are you trying to comfort me?"



"Uh..." Roland coughed twice, "I really think so."



"Don't worry, I won't feel sad for the enemy, even though she was a witch, the path she chose is completely different from the future I want to see. I figured this out on the way back on the ship." Nightingale took out a piece of dried fish and put it into her mouth, "Defeating the enemy, protecting my sisters, I'm just doing my duty."



"It's good that you think that way." Roland said, relieved. It seemed he had underestimated her; he thought she would feel lost and confused for killing a witch by her own hands, but she was able to adjust in a short time. It seemed that both in mind and belief, Nightingale was approaching maturity.



"However, there is one thing I want to ask you." She hesitated for a moment after swallowing the fish, then spoke up.



"What?"



"These days, have you done anything with Anna?" Nightingale's voice grew softer, yet her eyes remained fixed on the prince. "…You know what I mean."



Roland almost knocked over the cup in his hand, "Cough, cough, why do you ask… I've been busy arranging for the refugees these past days, I've scarcely had the chance to be alone with her."



Her eyes suddenly lit up, "You're not lying."



"Of course not, I am—"



Roland didn't get to finish his sentence when Nightingale suddenly disappeared from sight. Next, he felt a soft touch of lips on his own, a fleeting sensation that left only a hint of the salty taste of dried fish. It took him a while to realize what she had done.



"Wait—"



But he didn't manage to say the words before two slender fingers sealed his mouth. Although he couldn't see her, he knew Nightingale was right beside him.



"I know what you want to say…" Her whisper came from beside his ear, "I'm not trying to change anything, nor am I planning to get in front of Anna. I just hope to always be by your side, that's all. Please forgive me for not daring to show myself, because right now, I also don't know what expression I should face you with. Your Highness, you don't dislike me, do you?"



"…" Roland opened his mouth, to say he disliked Nightingale was absolutely impossible. The obstacles in his heart stemmed from the knowledge of over twenty years, not merely from simple affection. On this point, he couldn't deceive himself.



"Since that's the case," she whispered, "then let's not say anything. It's not your fault, I simply did what I wanted to do."
