## How could I possibly regret it?
A week later, the First Army Expedition Team and the witches finally arrived at Border Town. From the day they set out, this mission took nearly half a month, five days longer than expected.



The main reason for the delay was that on the return journey, the fortress agent, Petrov Hull, sent a messenger reporting the outbreak of an unidentified epidemic at Longsong Stronghold.



Since Roland had already warned Petrov, when the epidemic was discovered, he took the greatest possible quarantine measures, sealing off the affected district entirely, and sending a message to Border Town at the first opportunity.



After receiving the report of the outbreak, Roland had Maggie set off at high speed, following the Redwater River eastward to find the fleet carrying the First Army soldiers and instructing them to take a detour to Longsong Stronghold at the fork of the Redwater River. They were to extinguish the evil plague before returning to the town.



Roland, leading the remaining members of the First Army and the expedition team's families, welcomed them at the dock. Accompanied by the familiar march of the army, the soldiers saluted the prince with excitement, many of them imitating a knight's salute by kneeling on one knee and shouting long live. After disembarking, they embraced their loved ones tightly, while the echo of the salute cannons fired timely, making the atmosphere at the scene exceptionally lively, attracting the attention of many serfs and refugees.



Back at the castle, Iron Axe gave a complete report on the mission.



"You're saying that among the enemies who attacked the First Army this time, there were witches?" Roland pondered for a moment. "It's unlikely to be people from the Rats."



"Tassa thinks so too. He even believes that the Rats were directed by some other power, otherwise those scum rarely leave their nests. The only ones in the capital who could command the Rats and have witches are Timothy and the Church," said Iron Axe. "Even the great nobles couldn't come up with enough bargaining chips to make the largest underground organization in the locality take action all at once."



"However, Timothy himself is in the Eastern Region, and considering the audacity to send out witches to fight alone, I think the Church is a more likely suspect," Roland mused, recalling Wendy and Ashes's encounters, finding it not surprising that the Church might have a group of witches trained in secret. "Are you certain she is dead?"



"Hit in the chest by Nightingale, her ribcage was shattered," Iron Axe nodded. "We buried her in the wheat field, right where the bodies of the sentries were found."

The three-hundred-strong troop encountered a large-scale ratmen night raid on the last day. In the end, one died and four were injured, with the only fatality being at the hands of an enemy witch. The four injured were shot by hand crossbows wielded by enemies who had managed to get close by luck, but the rapid-fire capability of the revolving rifles ended the fight before it could devolve into hand-to-hand combat. The injured were properly bandaged up, and upon returning to Border Town, they immediately received treatment from Nana—with Lily's presence, the wounds were almost guaranteed not to get infected. As long as the crossbow bolts didn't hit any vital organs, and the bleeding was stopped, the chances of the soldiers' survival were extremely high.



All in all, Roland was very satisfied with the results of the First Army's first expedition. As for being infiltrated by a scout, he didn't know much about that, only that sentries should be set up to monitor each other, but he left the specifics to Iron Axe to figure out.



"You've worked hard," he said. "Tomorrow, I will hold a commendation ceremony at the central square of the town. Go inform all members of the First Army."



After Iron Axe left, Roland let out a long sigh.



"Well done," he said, taking out a bag of charcoal-roasted fish jerky from a drawer and placing it on the table. "If it weren't for you, they might have been in danger."



Nightingale appeared, smiling as she accepted the fish jerky. "I told you before we set out, leave everything to me."



"How strong was the opponent?"



"Agile and very decisive, she must have undergone several years of training. If I hadn't entered the Mist the moment she turned around to resist, I might have actually been hit by the choking powder she threw." Nightingale shrugged, recounting the confrontation lightly, but he knew it all happened in the blink of an eye. "I didn't want to kill her... but when I saw the look in her eyes as she tried to stab Wendy, I knew, nothing but death would stop her."



"..." Roland fell silent for a moment, "Do you remember what you told me after we defeated Timothy's militia and were coming back from the fortress?"



Nightingale thought for a while, "'It's not your fault'?"



"Exactly," he nodded, "If she had been raised by the Church from a young age to be a witch, she would only see you as traitors, as fallen ones. It would be difficult to redirect her ingrained thinking without years of being together... At the very least, you saved Wendy and the others."



Nightingale laughed, "Are you trying to comfort me?"



"Uh..." Roland coughed twice, "I really do think so."



"Don't worry, I won't feel sad for the enemy. Although she was a witch, the path she chose is completely different from the future I want to see. I figured this out on the boat ride back." Nightingale took out a piece of dried fish and put it in her mouth, "Defeating the enemy, protecting my sisters, I'm just fulfilling my duty."



"It's good that you think this way." Roland said with relief. It seemed that he had underestimated her; he thought she would feel lost and confused after personally killing a witch, but she managed to adjust in a short time. It appeared that both her mental state and beliefs were maturing.



"However, there's one thing I want to ask you." She hesitated for a moment after swallowing the fish, then spoke up.



"What is it?"



"These days, have you and Anna been up to anything?" Nightingale's voice grew softer, yet her eyes remained fixed on the prince. "You know what I mean."



Roland almost knocked over the cup in his hand. "Cough, cough, what are you asking this for... I've been busy settling the refugees these days, and I've hardly had the chance to be alone with her."



Her eyes suddenly lit up, "You're not lying."



"Of course not, I am—"



Roland's words were cut off mid-sentence as Nightingale suddenly vanished before his eyes, and he felt the soft touch of lips on his own. The sensation was fleeting, leaving only the salty taste of dried fish. It took him a long while to realize what she had done.



"Wait a minute—"



But he couldn't finish his sentence, as two slender fingers sealed his mouth. Although he couldn't see her, he knew Nightingale was right beside him.



"I know what you want to say..." Her whisper came close to his ear, "I don't intend to change anything, nor do I plan to get ahead of Anna. I just wish to always be by your side, that's all. Please forgive me for not daring to show myself, because right now I don't even know what expression I should face you with. Your Highness, you don't dislike me, do you?"



Roland opened his mouth, unable to speak. To say he disliked Nightingale was absolutely impossible. The barrier in his heart came from over twenty years of perceptions, not simple preference. On this point, he could not deceive himself.



"In that case," she whispered, "let's not say anything. This is not your fault; I simply did what I wanted to do."
