## Holy Mountain (Central)
"Sisters, that's the Holy Mountain! We've found it!"

Cara screamed, venting her joy. Many witches stood frozen in place, overwhelmed by the sight before them, while others came to their senses, hugging and crying with their companions nearby.

Redpupil, however, furrowed her eyebrows. "Is that really the Holy Mountain?"

"What's wrong, is there something amiss?" Leaf approached and asked in a low voice. She harbored the same doubts; the city in the sky looked nothing like the descriptions in the ancient books, which spoke of glittering gold and magnificent splendor. The spires, though impressive, were a dark grey color, appearing dim even in daylight. Not to mention the red mist that hung over the city, thick as undissolving blood.

"There's something... squeezed into those holes," Redpupil said with a dry voice. "I can't see clearly, but those things, they don't look like gods..."

Leaf felt a shiver run down her spine. Redpupil had the best vision in the Witch Cooperation Association, and her words made Leaf feel uneasy. It was unfortunate that Lightning had left with Nightingale; otherwise, she could have flown closer to take a look.

"Sisters! The Holy Mountain is right before our eyes," the Teacher raised her hands and shouted, "Put in a little more effort, and we will soon find eternity!"

After she spoke, she immediately urged the Stone Woman to carry her forward. Leaf wanted to step forward and stop her, but she hesitated and withdrew her foot. She remembered Wendy's fate half a month ago; at such a time, any attempt to dissuade would probably be futile. The Teacher would not rest until she saw it for herself.

The group began to hasten their pace. After leaving the foot of the mountain, the amount of snow unexpectedly decreased, and the temperature around them rose slightly. This was the legendary forbidden land, a place where humans could not set foot, Leaf thought, yet now they were imprinting their footsteps on this uninhabited land. If Lightning were here, she would have been so happy, wouldn't she?



Looking back, the towering mountains rose and fell behind her, forming an insurmountable barrier. This made Leaves wonder if it was because of the Impassable Mountain Range that the demonic beasts couldn't directly invade the heartland of the continent and had to detour through the extreme north instead.



Regardless, if she could truly find the Holy Mountain, she would no longer need to wander and roam, and that would be satisfaction enough... She sighed softly. To be honest, when Nightingale recounted what she had seen and heard in Border Town at the camp, Leaves had been tempted. When Wendy asked who wanted to leave with Nightingale, she even couldn't help wanting to step forward and loudly announce her name. But until the end, she still couldn't overcome the threshold in her heart, defeated by the shadows of her past.



Leaves shook her head, forcing herself not to think about these past events, and hastened to keep up with the pace of the group, swiftly moving across the yellow and white wilderness.



But soon, something strange occurred. No matter how much they quickened their pace, the city seemed to recede at the same rate as they approached. After an hour's walk, the "Holy Mountain's Abode" remained suspended in the clouds, neither growing larger nor getting smaller, as if... they hadn't moved at all.



"Mentor, please rest for a while, the sisters are tired," Stone said. During this time, several groups had taken turns carrying the mentor, and she had persisted the longest.



"No, how can we stop now!" Cara rejected her suggestion without a second thought, "This is a test from the divine, sisters. Without a firm will, we will never reach the Holy Mountain! We cannot stop, we must go on until the gate of the Holy Mountain appears before our eyes!"



Seeing that persuasion was ineffective, the group could only continue moving forward.



However, the situation did not change. On their journey, the witches encountered two waves of demonic beasts, and in the second wave, two twisted hybrid beasts appeared. Leaves' grass bindings did not hold for long, and one of the sisters was caught off guard, her neck slashed open by sharp claws, splattering blood all over the ground.



After finally dealing with these monsters, everyone realized that the sky was gradually darkening; it was clearly dusk. The city was still in front of them, only its outline had become more blurred, as if it was about to disappear.



Based on past experience, they had to find a suitable place to set up camp, but this place was completely different from the Impassable Mountain Range. With a vast flatness stretching before their eyes and the constant threat of demonic beasts, it was impossible to spend the night in such an area.



"Mentor, let's retreat to the foot of the mountain first! Let Akari lead the way and Red Pepper provide illumination. Maybe we can make it back before midnight."



"No!" Cara shouted, "It took us an entire afternoon to get here, and we hardly stopped along the way. Everyone's strength is already greatly depleted; it's impossible to maintain the same speed on the way back. Sisters, hold on a little longer. We can truly rest only once we find the Holy Mountain."



"What about Sherry?" someone asked, pointing at the lifeless witch on the ground.



"We don't have time to bury her," the Mentor shook her head. "Let's leave her here; the earth will embrace her."



Leaf closed her eyes in sorrow. Another sister was gone. If only her power had been stronger, she wouldn't have had to die in this desolate land without even a tombstone to mark her passing.



Just as everyone hesitated between advancing and retreating, Stone Girl suddenly exclaimed, "Look at the sky, the city is gone!"



Leaf opened her eyes and looked up, only to see the sky had turned to a dark grey, with the clouds hidden in the night. The city had vanished without a trace, as if it had never existed at all.



Everyone stood rooted to the spot, the silence around them terrifyingly profound.



The city that could never be approached, the illusion floating in the sky, disappearing into nothingness when the sun sets... Leaf suddenly recalled the adventure stories told by Lightning, those bizarre illusions seen on the great sea. She shivered and whispered, "We've been deceived..." Soon, she shouted, "We've been deceived, that's not the Holy Mountain at all! What we saw was a mirage!"



"A mirage?" Cara turned her head sharply, her frightening expression somewhat alarming, "What is that?"



"Lightning mentioned it in her stories, this phenomenon is often encountered at sea, but it's much rarer on land. What we saw was just an illusion; the real city might be very far from us, or perhaps, it might not even be in front of us!"



"So that at least proves that it truly exists? And it hasn't disappeared?"



"That..." Leaf was at a loss, "I don't know."



At that moment, Redpupil suddenly issued a warning, "Be careful! Something's coming!" She stared intently to the left of the group, her face looking very ugly.



"Is it another demonic beast?" Chase prepared to face the enemy, "How many are there?"



"No..." Redpupil took two steps back, "I don't know what that is..."



As they spoke, a shadow approached from afar, with lightning speed, shooting straight towards Redpupil. Although she saw the incoming shadow, she couldn't dodge itâ€”it was too fast, unlike a crossbow bolt.



Almost in the blink of an eye, the shadow pierced through Redpupil's chest, carrying her off her feet and nailing her directly into the trunk of the tree behind, along with the person.

It was actually a long spear.
