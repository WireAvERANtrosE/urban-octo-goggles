## Identity Registration
Outside the Western Region's city wall, the refugees, under the guidance of the First Army soldiers, underwent an unprecedented identity check.



Barov naturally knew that the population was the most treasured asset of Prince Roland. To bring these people back to Border Town, His Highness had spent a great deal of Gold Royals, even going so far as to dispatch the First Army on an expedition to the capital. When the bill from the Margrave Commercial Association was placed before Barov, he nearly dropped his jaw in astonishment.



In the span of half a month, the costs for renting ships, transportation, food supplies, and so on had added up, astonishingly amounting to over two thousand Gold Royals—equivalent to the selling price of four steam engines. If it weren't for the down payment received last month for the modification of two sailing ships, this financial statement would probably be showing a deficit.



After the refugees were brought back, the cumbersome and massive task of statistics fell upon him. Officials from the City Hall and apprentices were almost all mobilized, setting up wooden sheds and passages at the foot of the city wall to categorize, count, and record these people. Looking at the refugees slowly passing through the checkpoints in more than ten lines, Barov saw them as a group of moving coins.



Compared to the long queues at the registration desks for ordinary civilians, the professional talent channel he was personally in charge of was much quieter, with only about fifty or sixty people having passed through so far.



"I am... a carpenter," said a middle-aged man cautiously approaching, "I heard that any craftsman can get a place to live?"



"That's correct," Seni Dali asked, "What's your name? Can you read?"



This former knight from the Wild Wolf family had been doing well in the Agricultural Department, at least so far without any mistakes, and Barov was quite satisfied with his own judgment of people. Although it was a population census, there were unfortunately only so many literate people in the City Hall, so he had to pull in people from other departments as well.



"Uh... My lord, my name is Malt." The man paused, "I can't read."



"You can't read or write?"

"Yes," the middle-aged man said, with his head lowered.

"Well, as for carpentry..." Sini rummaged through a stack of inquiry forms, looking for one labeled with the word 'carpenter', "Ah, found it. Let me ask you a few questions."

This preliminary screening method was devised by His Highness the Prince. He gathered craftsmen from various industries, asked them about their professional knowledge and corresponding solutions, and recorded their answers to form a set of inquiry sheets. In this way, by simply asking a few questions from the form during the review, one could immediately know whether the other party was lying or not. When Barov first saw this method of lie detection, he couldn't help but praise the devilish ingenuity of it; most commoners wouldn't delve into these matters unless they worked in the industry. If someone tried to impersonate a professional, they could be stumped with just two or three questions.

"What tool is used to smooth the surface of wood?"

"It's... the plane, my lord."

"What are the common types of saws?"

"Frame saws and bow saws, and occasionally a hand saw for cutting smaller pieces."

After several questions, Mather was mostly able to answer and gradually began to speak more fluently.



"Hmm, it seems that you are indeed a carpenter." Sini was about to write down this person's name on the registration form when Barov stopped him.

"My lord?"

"Don't jump to conclusions so quickly, take a look at his hands first." He turned to Mayne, "Stretch out your hands."

Mayne was startled by this request, and with a puzzled look, he spread out his hands— the skin of his palms was extremely rough, with many soil particles mixed into the cracked lines, and there were thick calluses under each finger, showing signs of hard labor.

"If he were a carpenter, his palms wouldn't be this rough, especially the two pads below the center of the palm, which would become smooth and tough from frequent friction with wood. Moreover, carpenters often use black lacquer to draw outline lines, so their palms would be stained with a lot of black ink that is difficult to wash off, turning them pitch black, not yellow," Barov said calmly. "Another thing, he always shifts his gaze before answering—many people show a similar expression when they try to recall memories that they don't frequently use. If he were a carpenter, his answers should be much more natural."

"Is... that so." Sini's eyes widened.

Barov looked towards Mayne, who wore a look of surprise, and said in a stern voice, "You should have heard the warning when the First Army soldiers called you, any acts of impersonation, deceit, and refusal to register will be met with severe punishment. Either you'll be sent to the mines, or you'll be expelled from the Western Region. Now, do you still think you are a carpenter?"

"No, my lord, I was wrong!" Mayne couldn't help but kneel down, "The carpenter is my neighbor, I only watched him work!"

"Go and line up over there."



Seeing the other party flee in a panic, Sean exclaimed in amazement, "Sir, how did you come to know these things?"

"During the Evil Months, I conducted a census for His Highness and dealt with every carpenter in the town. I just happened to note it down at the time," Barov replied with a casual air. Seeing the expression of shock and admiration on the knight's face, he immediately felt a surge of pride within himself.

The devil's methods were clever, but they would always deceive some people. Only someone like himself could fill the gaps for His Highness.

Moreover, influenced by His Highness, the way he handled problems had changed from before... Barov couldn't help but sigh inwardly. In the past, commoners like these would have been strictly punished with thunderous methods to deter those who harbored ill intentions. Now, by letting him go, he probably wanted to save some Gold royals for Prince Roland — after all, each refugee was quite valuable, and without working in Border Town for a decade or so, it would never cover the cost of transporting them from thousands of miles away.

As the next refugee underwent the professional questioning, Sean did not immediately proceed with the registration but turned his gaze to Barov.

He scrutinized the examinee for a few moments and nodded, "You take note of it. I'll take him to see His Highness."

Passing through the gate in the city wall, on the other side was the tent set up by Roland Wimbledon, which was also the last checkpoint.

Here, they would be personally questioned by His Highness. If confirmed to be unproblematic, they would receive a 'Resident Identity Card' and become official residents of Border Town. Currently, with the housing shortage in the town, priority was given to craftsmen for accommodation, while refugees without any particular skills would have to wait outside the city walls for another two or three months.

Barov also had an identity card — it was a colored, hard piece of paper, roughly the size of a palm, with his portrait drawn on the top left corner that looked just like him, with his name, address, and number written in the middle. On the back of the paper was the insignia of the double guns of Greycastle, as well as the signature and seal of His Highness. Both the paper itself and the thin film that wrapped it were made of a strange material. Whether soaked in water or baked in fire, the identity card remained undamaged.



Without a doubt, that thing must have been conjured by the witch named Soraya. Prince Roland seems to plan on promoting the use of identity cards throughout the entire town; from now on, whether purchasing food or distributing salaries, one would need the card to receive them. 



Ever since he awarded a medal to the young miss of the Pine family during the awarding ceremony, His Highness has clearly no longer intended to conceal the existence of witches. Barov has stopped caring about who is right or wrong between the demons and the Church, and even... he has started to secretly hope that Prince Roland could defeat the Church and completely unify Greycastle.



Without a doubt, the higher the position His Highness stands in, the more substantial the rewards he would receive. 



Of course, there is still a long way to go before reaching that step, something to consider in the future. The town's population has already surpassed that of Longsong Stronghold, and His Highness has also revealed his plans to build a city next year—once it connects to the stronghold, it will transform a great portion of the Western Region into a whole. Its scale will undoubtedly surpass that of the capital, becoming the most magnificent city in Greycastle, and as the head of the City Hall, what kind of promotion will he receive by then?



Barov is full of anticipation for the future.
