## Identity Registration
Outside the Western Region's city walls, refugees were undergoing an unprecedented identity check under the guidance of the First Army soldiers.



Barov naturally knew that population was the most valued asset by Prince Roland. In order to bring these people back to Border Town, his Highness had spent a substantial amount of Gold Royals, even going so far as to dispatch the First Army on an expedition to the King's City. When the bill from the Margrave Consortium was laid in front of Barov, he nearly dropped his jaw.



In just half a month, the combined costs of the caravan's ship rentals, transportation, and food supplies amounted to over two thousand Gold Royals, equivalent to the price of four steam engines. If it hadn't been for the advance payment received last month for the modification of two sailing ships, this financial report would likely have shown a deficit.



After the refugees were brought back, the cumbersome and massive task of statistics fell upon him. Officials and apprentices from the City Hall were almost fully mobilized, erecting wooden shelters and passages at the base of the walls to categorize, count, and record these people in the archives. Watching the refugees slowly pass through the checkpoints in lines that stretched over ten rows, Barov saw them as a stream of moving coins.



Compared to the long queues at the registration desks for ordinary civilians, the special passage for skilled professionals that he personally oversaw was much quieter, with only about fifty or sixty people having passed through so far.



"I am... a carpenter," a middle-aged man approached cautiously at that moment, "I heard that any artisan could get a place to live?"



"That's right," Sonny Dali asked, "What's your name? Can you read and write?"



This former Knight of the Wild Wolf family had been handling his work at the Ministry of Agriculture with ease, and so far, not a single mistake had been made. Barov was very satisfied with his ability to judge character. Although this was a population census, given the limited number of literate people in the City Hall, it was necessary to pull in people from other departments as well.



"Uh... my lord, my name is Malt." The man paused, "I cannot read."



"Neither reading nor writing?"

"Yes," the middle-aged man said, head lowered.

"Well, for a carpenter..." Sonny rummaged through a stack of inquiry forms, searching for one labeled with the word 'carpenter.' "Ah, found it. Let me ask you a few questions."



This initial screening method was devised by His Highness the Prince. He gathered craftsmen from various professions, asked them about their specialized knowledge and corresponding solutions, and recorded their answers to create a set of inquiry forms. Thus, during the review process, by simply asking a few questions from the form, one could immediately know if the other party was lying. When Barov first saw this method of lie detection, he couldn't help but applaud the devil's cunning. Most commoners would not bother to learn these things if they were not in the industry, and if someone tried to impersonate a professional, just two or three questions would be enough to leave them speechless.



"What tool is used to smooth the surface of wood?"

"It's... a jack plane, my lord."

"What are the common types of saws used?"

"A frame saw and a bow saw, and occasionally a hand saw for cutting smaller pieces."



After a few questions, Mayne was mostly able to answer, and his tone gradually became more fluent as he spoke.



"Hmm, it seems you really are a carpenter," Sonny was about to write down the man's name on the identity registration form when Barov stopped him.



"My lord?"



"Don't be so quick to judge. Take a look at his hands first." He looked at Mayne, "Stretch out your hands."



Mayne froze upon hearing this, a look of confusion on his face as he spread out his hands—The skin in the palms was extremely rough, with many soil particles mixed into the cracked lines, and thick calluses under each finger, looking weather-beaten.



"If he were a carpenter, his palms wouldn't be this rough, especially the two pads of flesh below the palm, which would become smooth and tough from frequent friction with wood. Additionally, carpenters often need to use black lacquer to draw outline lines, so their palms would be stained with a lot of black ink that's hard to wash off and become pitch-black, not yellow," Barov said calmly. "Another point, he always shifts his gaze away when answering—a lot of people inadvertently show similar expressions when recalling memories that they don't frequently use. If he were a carpenter, his answers should be much more natural."



"Is... that so?" Sonny's eyes widened.



Barov looked toward the surprised Mayne and said sternly, "You must have heard the warning when the First Army soldiers called you here—any impersonation, deception, and refusal to register will be met with severe punishment. Either be sent to the mines or expelled from the Western Territory. Now, do you still think you are a carpenter?"



"No, my lord, I was wrong!" Mayne couldn't help but kneel down, "The carpenter is my neighbor, I just often watched him work!"



"Go join the line over there."



Seeing the other party fleeing in panic, Sonny clicked his tongue and said, "Sir, how do you know all these things?"

"During Evil Months, I conducted a census for His Highness and dealt with every carpenter in the small town. I just happened to take note of them," Barov answered with an air of nonchalance. Seeing the look of shock and admiration on the knight's face, a sense of pride welled up inside him.

The devil's methods might be clever, but they will inevitably deceive some people. Only someone like himself could fill the gaps for His Highness.

Furthermore, influenced by His Highness, the way he dealt with problems had also changed from before... Barov couldn't help but sigh to himself. In the past, such commoners would definitely have been punished with thunderous methods to deter those who harbored ill intentions. Now, by letting him go, he probably wanted to save some Gold royals for Prince Roland — after all, each refugee was quite valuable. If they didn't work for Border Town for a decade or so, it wouldn't cover the cost of transporting them from thousands of miles away.

When the next refugee came through for the professional inquiry, Sonny didn't immediately register him but instead looked towards Barov.

After sizing up the examinee, he nodded and said, "You record it, I'll take him to see His Highness."

Passing through the city wall's opening, on the other side were the shacks set up by Roland Wimbledon, which was also the last checkpoint.

Here, they would be personally interrogated by His Highness. If confirmed to be unproblematic, they would receive a "Resident Identity Card" and become an official resident of Border Town. Currently, with housing in short supply within the town, priority was given to craftsmen for accommodation. As for the refugees without any particular skills, they would have to wait another two or three months outside the city walls.

Barov also had an identity card—it was a colored piece of hard paper, roughly the size of a palm, with his portrait drawn in the upper left corner, looking just like him, and his name, address, and number written in the middle. On the back of the card was printed the emblem of Greycastle's double guns, along with His Highness's signature and seal. Both the paper itself and the thin film wrapping it were of a very strange material. Whether soaked in water or baked in fire, the identity card would not be damaged in the slightest.



Undoubtedly, that thing must have been the doing of the witch named Soraya. Prince Roland seems to intend to extend the identity card system to the entire town, so that in the future, whether it is to purchase food or to distribute salaries, it will all be done by presenting the card.



Ever since he awarded a medal to the young Miss of the Pine Family during the award ceremony, His Highness obviously no longer intends to conceal the existence of witches, and Barov no longer wants to bother himself with who is right or wrong between the devils and the Church, and even... he has begun to secretly hope that Prince Roland can defeat the Church and completely unify Greycastle.



Without a doubt, the higher the position Prince Roland stands in, the more rewarding the returns he will receive.



Of course, there is still a long way to go before reaching that step, and it can be considered later. Now, the population of the town has already exceeded that of Longsong Stronghold, and His Highness has also revealed to him the plan to build a city next year—once it is connected to the stronghold, it will turn the greater part of the Western Region into a whole, and its scale will undoubtedly surpass the King's City, becoming the most magnificent city in Greycastle. And as the head of the City Hall, what kind of promotion will he receive by then?



Barov is filled with anticipation for the future.
