## Star of the Theater (Part 1)
The Swan sailed westward along the Redwater River, with May standing at the bow, her eyes fixed ahead. She was not admiring the scenery but wanted to see the docks of Border Town sooner.

"How much longer until we reach our destination?" she asked impatiently.

"We're almost there, Miss May. It's quite sunny here; you should go back and rest in the cabin," Gatro said from behind her. Without looking, she knew he must be wearing a flattering smile.

Turning her head, May found it to be true, "You said we were almost there before, and now it's still almost there? Have you ever been to Border Town or not?"

"Uh..." he was at a loss for words for a moment, finally scratching his head, "I last came here ten years ago."

"A year can change the ruler of Longsong Stronghold, let alone ten years?" May said annoyedly, "But there are exceptions, I see you havenâ€™t changed at all, the same for ten years, always unable to make it onto the stage."

Seeing him stiffly retreat with a strained smile, she felt a bit more comfortable inside. If it weren't for the news of Irene, she really didn't want to take the same ship to Border Town with this group of extras.

As the star actress of the Stronghold Theater, she was quite famous throughout the Western Region, and this time she was even invited by the Tower Theater to perform "The Prince's Quest for Love" in the capital of Greycastle. The play was a great success, and even the master of drama, Mr. Kajin Fis, praised her for bringing the role of the lovelorn princess to life. Although she did not play the leading role, the impression she left was no less profound than that of the lead actress.

But when she returned to Longsong Stronghold with great enthusiasm, she found that the place had undergone earth-shaking changes. Duke Ryan was defeated and killed, the stronghold fell into the hands of the fourth prince, Roland Wimbledon, and was currently temporarily managed by Petrov Hull of the Honeysuckle Family... Less than a year after her departure, the Western Region had become unfamiliar.



Fortunately, the political turmoil in the upper echelons did not greatly affect the theater. If that were all, it would merely add a topic of conversation for May and her sisters after dinner. However, the news that the First Knight of the Western Region, Morning Light, had been captured suddenly clenched her heart.



May immediately rushed to the theater, wanting to ask Irene about the situation, only to find out that she had also gone to Border Town half a month earlier, probably to reunite with her husband. This news left May feeling disappointed, but also a little envious.



Working in the same theater, she was the undisputed star, while Irene was a newcomer yet to make a name for herself. The title of Flower of Tomorrow was nothing more than flattery from a group of miscellaneous actors; in terms of appearance, she had confidence that she did not lose to the other; in terms of family background, although she was of common birth, Irene was just an orphan adopted by the theater, which in her view was not as good by a long shot.



Yet what May couldn't let go of was the fact that Morning Light, Phyllis Hilt, had fallen for that naive-looking Irene. Later, to marry her, he even gave up his right to inherit his family's title.



"Look, farmland," someone shouted, "We're not far from Border Town now."



May looked to the left side of the ship and saw rows of wheat stalks, not even knee-high, swaying in the wind. The farmers, wearing straw hats, were busy in the fields as if they were in a sea of green. The wheat fields, accompanied by the gleaming river, stretched to the west as far as the eye could see.



"This scenery is really beautiful, Miss May," Rosia came over and nodded to her, "I didn't expect to see farmland as vast as that of the Longsong Stronghold in such a remote place."



"Compared to the capital, this is nothing," May said dismissively. "There, the wheat fields can even connect two cities, with nothing but wheat all the way, so much that it becomes tiresome."



"Is that so," she smiled awkwardly, "I've never been that far away."



"Hmm, that's the reaction a normal person would have," May thought. If it were Irene hearing these words, she'd probably be showing a face full of envy, asking me to tell her more. "Don't worry, you'll have the chance to go in the future."

"I hope so," Rosia patted her chest, "Thank you for the encouragement."

I mean you only need to spend a few Silver royals to hitch a ride with a caravan to the capital, not that you could go there to perform in a play, May rolled her eyes inwardly. But since the other party was a friend of Irene's, May didn't bother to say all that out loud.

Rosia had joined the theatre earlier than her and was about the same age, but because of her plain appearance and poor memory, she had never had the opportunity to perform on stage formally. Apart from Irene, there were few in the theatre who were willing to interact with her.

"Does Irene know we're coming today?" May asked.

"I arranged the date in my reply to her letter; she should be waiting for us at the docks."

"That's good," she nodded, "I don't want to be looking for a place to stay alone in a strange town."

"May I ask you something, Miss May?" Rosia hesitated, "Why are you coming to the town with us, and moreover, why are you doing it secretly, without the theatre's knowledge? Irene's letter mentioned there might be opportunities to perform, but you're not short on opportunities."

"If I were to tell the truth, do you think the theatre would let me come to this godforsaken place?" May curled her lip, "As for why I'm coming here... I just want to see if my theatre companions are doing well, that's all."



She didn't know why she made such an impulsive decision. The Longsong Stronghold Theater had major plays scheduled for the next two days, and her sudden departure would likely give the theater owner a headache. Although there were a few understudy actresses, without her, the nobles might not be satisfied and, in a serious case, even lodge a protest against the theater.



To be honest, this was not a wise choice. May understood this; no matter how famous she was, she still depended on the theater for her existence. If she angered the theater owner, who might shelve her and promote a new actress instead, she would be helpless. She could either compromise and apologize or leave and compete with the leading actresses of other theaters.



Or perhaps... return to the Stronghold immediately after meeting with Phyllis? May thought.



"I see," said Rosia with a nod. "Irene will be very surprised to see you."



The scenery along the riverbank gradually became more varied, with many tents and wooden houses appearing on the side closer to the Impassable Mountain Range. It was nearing noon, and the farmer's wives were busy boiling porridge and stewing soup, with columns of smoke rising from the residential area. May could occasionally catch the scent of wheat in the air. Children gathered by the river to play, with the more water-savvy stripping down and diving into the river amid their companions' cheers, then climbing out triumphantly onto the shore.



May finally saw the long-awaited dock.



After the Swan anchored, Gait and Sam volunteered to take care of all the ladies' luggage. As the group stepped off the gangway, Rosia excitedly called out, "Irene!"



Following her gaze, May saw a woman in a white dress vigorously waving at them from the dockside, and standing next to her was a tall man. Even from a great distance, his upright and robust figure revealed his extraordinary valor.



Dawn's Twilight, Phyllis Hill.



The figure in May's memory once again became clear.
