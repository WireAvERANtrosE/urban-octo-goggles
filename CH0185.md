## Star of the Theater (Part 1)
The Swan sailed westward along the Redwater River, with May standing at the bow, staring straight ahead. She wasn't there to enjoy the scenery; she just wanted to see the docks of Border Town sooner.



"How much longer until we reach our destination?" she asked impatiently.



"We're almost there, Miss May. It's too sunny here; you should go back inside and rest," Gatro said from behind her. Without looking, she knew he must be wearing a fawning smile.



Turning her head, May saw that indeed he was, "You told me the same thing earlier, that we were almost there, and now we're still almost there? Have you ever been to Border Town or not?"



"Uh..." He was at a loss for words for a moment before scratching his head. "The last time I came here was ten years ago."



"A year could change the ruler of Longsong Stronghold, let alone ten years," May said irritably. "But I suppose there are exceptions. You seem to have not changed at all, always failing to make it onto the stage for a decade."



Seeing him retreat with a stiff smile on his face, she felt a bit more comfortable. If it hadn't been for the news about Irene, she really wouldn't have wanted to travel to Border Town with this group of bit-part actors.



As a star actress of the Stronghold Theatre, she was quite famous throughout the Western Region. This time, she was even invited by the High Tower Theater to perform in the Kingdom of Graycastle's capital in "The Prince's Love Quest." The show was a huge success, and even the great dramatist, Mr. Kajen Fels, praised her for bringing the role of the lovelorn princess to life. Although she wasn't the leading lady, the impression she left on the audience was no less profound.



But when she returned to Longsong Stronghold, excited and full of energy, she found that the place had undergone earth-shattering changes. Duke Lion had been defeated and perished, and the Stronghold had fallen into the hands of the fourth prince, Roland Wimbledon, currently temporarily managed by Peter Helmann of the Honeysuckle Family... In less than a year of her absence, the Western Region had become unrecognizable.



Fortunately, the political turmoil in the upper echelons had little impact on the theater. If it were just that, it would have merely provided May and her sisters with a bit of after-dinner conversation. However, the news that the First Knight of the Western Region, Dawnenlight, had been captured suddenly wrenched her heart.



May immediately rushed to the theater, wanting to find Irene to inquire about the situation, only to discover that she, too, had gone to Border Town half a month earlier, probably to reunite with her husband. This news disappointed May, but it also mixed in a touch of envy.



Working in the same theater, she was the undisputed star, while Irene was a newcomer yet to make a name for herself. The title of "Flower of Tomorrow" was nothing more than flattery from a group of assorted actors; in terms of appearance, she had confidence that she in no way lost to the other; in terms of family background, although she was of common birth, Irene was just an orphan taken in by the theater, which in any case made her lot seem much stronger.



What May found hard to let go of, though, was that Dawnenlight Philip Â· Hilter had fallen for the naive-looking Irene and even willingly gave up his family inheritance to marry her.



"Look, the farmland," someone shouted, "We're not far from Border Town now."



May looked to the left side of the ship and saw rows of wheat stalks swaying in the wind, no higher than the knee, with farmers wearing straw hats busy in the fields, as if they were in the midst of a verdant sea. The wheat fields, accompanied by the sparkling river water, stretched westward as far as the eye could see.



"This scenery is just too beautiful, Miss May," Roxy came over and nodded to her, "I didn't expect to see such extensive farmland in this remote place, rivaling that of Longsong Stronghold."



"Compared to the capital, this is nothing," May dismissively said, "There, the wheat fields could even connect two cities together, all you see on the road is wheat, to the point of becoming tiresome."



"Is that so," she said with an awkward smile, "I've never been to such far-off places."



Hmm, that's the reaction normal people should have, May thought. If it were Irene hearing these words, she would probably show a face full of envy and ask for more details. "Don't worry, you'll have the chance to go there in the future."



"I hope so," Rosia patted her chest, "Thanks for the encouragement."



What I meant was that you could spend a few Silver Royals to ride with a caravan to the King's City, not that you could go there to perform in a play, May rolled her eyes inwardly. But since the other person was a good friend of Irene's, May didn't bother to say all that out loud.



Rosia had joined the theater before her, and they were about the same age. However, due to her average appearance and poor memory, she never had the chance to perform formally on stage. Apart from Irene, not many people in the theater were willing to interact with her.



"Does Irene know we're arriving today?" May asked.



"I've arranged the date in my reply to her, so she should be waiting for us at the dock."



"That's good," she nodded, "I don't want to have to look for a place to stay alone in an unfamiliar town."



"Can I ask you something, Miss May?" Rosia hesitated, "Why are you coming to the town with us, and why are you doing it secretly without the theater's knowledge? Irene's letter mentioned that there might be opportunities to perform, but you certainly don't lack opportunities."



"If I told the truth, do you think the theater would let me come to this godforsaken place?" May curled her lip, "As for why I'm coming here... I just want to see how my fellow theater companions are doing, that's all."



She didn't know why she had made such an impulsive decision. The Longsong Stronghold theater had major plays scheduled for the next two days, and her abrupt departure would likely cause a headache for the theater owner. Although there were several understudy actresses, without her, the nobles might not be satisfied, and in severe cases, they might even lodge protests against the theater.



Truth be told, this was not a wise choice. May was aware of this; no matter how famous she became, she still depended on the theater for her livelihood. If she angered the theater owner and he decided to freeze her out and promote a new leading actress instead, she would be helpless. Her options would be to either compromise and apologize or leave and compete with the leading stars of other theaters.



Or... perhaps she should just take a ship back to the Stronghold immediately after meeting with Philip? May thought.



"I see," Rosia nodded. "Irene will surely be very surprised to see you."



The scenery along the riverbank gradually became richer, with many tents and wooden huts appearing on this side closer to the Impassable Mountain Range. It was nearing noon, and the farmwives were busy boiling porridge and stewing soup, with wisps of smoke rising from the residential area. May could occasionally catch the scent of wheat. The children gathered by the river to play, with the more adept swimmers stripping down and diving into the river amidst their companions' cheers, then climbing out proudly onto the bank.



May finally saw the long-awaited dock.



When the Swan ship docked, Gait and Sam eagerly volunteered to handle all the ladies' luggage. As the group walked down the gangway, Rosia couldn't contain her excitement and called out, "Irene!"



May followed the direction of the shout and saw a woman in a white dress vigorously waving at them from the dockside. Standing beside her was a tall man whose heroic and robust stature was evident even from a distance.



Dawn's Light, Philip Hilt.



May's memory of the figure once again became clear.
