## Reorganization of the Team
"So, our task is over now, isn't it?" Moe said regretfully as he cleaned up the remnants of the campfire on the square. "I really don't want to go back to working in the mines. Honestly, I'm starting to miss Evil Months."



"Yeah, I don't want to deal with those rocks either," Jop chimed in, "Most importantly, the pay is much worse. Where else can you find a job like the Artillery Squad, where you get meat every day and a salary of 15 Silver Royals per month?"



"What nonsense are you talking about?" Tanner, who was holding a torch for light, said irritably, "It's only because His Highness distributed more food that no one starved to death during Evil Months. Think about the past two years, half the people from the old district didn't survive the winter! Miss that? Besides, the team isn't going to be disbanded. His Highness recruited us into the Artillery Squad and burned so much gunpowder just to hear it go off?"



"But the demonic beasts are gone, what does His Highness need the Artillery Squad for?" Rodney asked, leaning on a broom.



The Artillery Squad wasn't prepared for the demonic beasts, Tanner thought, but in the end, he didn't say it, "Anyway, we'll know the answer tomorrow," he yawned and waved his hand impatiently, "Let's clean up here quickly, I want to go back to sleep early."



The next morning, the assembly call that echoed throughout the camp confirmed Tanner's words.



After everyone gathered, Iron Axe stood in front of the lined-up troops and said loudly: "You have completed the first phase of your task—defending Border Town from the demonic beasts. After three months and six days of battle, you have earned His Highness's recognition! The Militia will now be reorganized into His Highness's regular army. If anyone is unwilling to continue fighting, you may step forward now. His Highness has said that those who leave the Militia at this moment will receive their full salary, plus an additional 25 Silver Royals as a..." He thought for a moment about His Highness's words, "Well, as a retirement fee."



Out of three hundred people, not one moved, only Moe raised his hand and said, "Report."



This was also one of the strange rules His Highness the Prince had set during training, that team members should not whisper to each other in private; if they had something to ask, they had to shout "report" first.



Iron Axe nodded. "Speak."



"What does it mean to be a regular army? Does it mean ennobling us as knights?"



Tanner couldn't help but let out a snort of laughter, but he quickly returned to a serious and stern expression.



Knights? That's practically nobility, with not only property and retainers but also granted lands. To ask such a question really disgraces the artillery squad.



"No," Iron Axe explained patiently, evidently having asked His Highness about this, "a regular army is a military force that engages in combat as its primary occupation, fighting only to protect His Highness and His Highness's territory. In other words, while workers are mining in the mines, you are training; while farmers are harvesting wheat, you are training; while merchants are selling goods, you are still training. All the training is for victory in future battles, just as you did during the Evil Months."



"What's the difference between that and the militia?" Moe asked again.



"More frequent training, stricter systems, and more generous rewards."



"Report!" This time it was Rodney, who, after Iron Axe nodded, asked eagerly, "What are the more generous rewards?"



Tanner sighed. Why were the young fellows in his group all so impatient? Although he too was curious about the answer to that question.



"The regular army will implement an officer system. Those who complete their combat tasks according to the designated plan during battle, or those who exhibit outstanding performance, can be promoted to officers," Iron Axe said loudly. "For example, standing at my position."



Is this what His Highness said... Tanner thought to himself. If this is really implemented, isn't this encouraging insubordination? He quietly looked around, but everyone seemed oblivious to this issue and listened with great interest.



"Officers can receive higher pay and... their own land."



The last sentence caused a stir among the troops, and Tanner was no exception. He even wondered if he had heard wrong. If they could get land, what would be the difference between them and knights?



"But remember, once you choose to become a regular soldier, the regulations you must follow will be completely different from the militia. For example, failing to complete a task, fleeing in the face of battle, desertion, and other disciplinary violations will be severely punished. This is not just about skipping an egg for breakfast; punishments include labor, imprisonment, and even hanging. And any positions and rewards obtained will also be revoked." Iron Axe paused, "It's still not too late to back out now."



There was silence among the crowd. After Iron Axe silently counted to ten, still no one moved. He couldn't help but grin, "Very well, from today onwards, you are a regular army directly under the command of His Highness Prince Roland Wimbledon!"



Tanner himself found it incredible. If he had heard about those terrible punishments three months ago, he would have fled already. What's the use of promotion, what's the use of land, none are as good as keeping your own life safe. But now, he almost hesitated not at all in choosing to stand his ground. Compared to going back to Northern Slope Mine to break rocks, or hanging around aimlessly in the old district, Tanner felt he was more suited for this place.



"You have good observational skills, what's your name?"



"Mr. Tanner, do your best."



Thinking of His Highness's encouragement, he once again confirmed his thoughts—he belonged to the Militia, and in the future, he would also continue to fight for His Highness as a member of the regular army.

...

Iron Axe quickly announced the first training of the day: field marching.

At first, Tanner didn't take it seriously, as running was a kind of training that was rarely interrupted even during the Evil Months. After having breakfast, they would run a couple of laps around the town regardless of the weather, unless it was a heavy snowfall that would force a halt. According to His Highness, this was beneficial for limbering up the limbs so that they would not be stiff when defending the walls, preventing any struggle in thrusting spears.

However, as soon as the team ran out of Border Town, he immediately felt the difference.

The snow in the field had not yet reached the point of melting. After three months of intermittent snowfall, it was deep enough to reach over the knees. It was more like crawling through the snow rather than running. The team immediately became strung out, and it took a lot of effort to pull out a foot once it sank into the snow.

There was no doubt that this kind of physically demanding training was definitely thought up by Prince Roland. Tanner had already grasped His Highness's thoughts. Protesting was basically useless at this point; the only thing to do was to stick it out to the end.

This round trip took up the entire morning. By the time the team returned to the town, Tanner felt as though his legs were no longer his own.

The snow that had filled his boots had melted into water, and even standing in the sun, most people were still shivering from the cold. The huge physical exertion made the chill even worse, and even Iron Axe felt somewhat overwhelmed. He announced the team's dismissal and pushed back lunchtime by half an hour, allowing everyone to change out of their soaked boots and trousers first.



The one thing that brought everyone some relief was that the afternoon training had been canceled.

Of course, they were all unaware that Lightning had been tracking their march training the entire way—it was also part of the young girl's daily training routine: precise control of magical power for steady flight. When she reported her observations to Roland, he was almost at a loss whether to laugh or cry.

The total distance covered by the troop that morning: four kilometers.
