## Explorer
"Master!" Seeing Cara fall, the witches panicked and gathered around her.



"Fools! Cough cough..." She clutched her wound, feeling completely numb in her lower body, "Hurry, go kill that traitor for me!"



By this time, Nightingale had already taken Wendy and vanished into the mist.



Back at the crossroads, she saw Wendy's forearm had turned black, the poison spreading steadily—she could hesitate no longer. Gritting her teeth, she rolled up the other's sleeve, tied a cloth tightly around the upper arm, then pulled a handle-less dagger from the sole of her shoe and plunged it downwards.



It took half a moment, but she managed to sever Wendy's entire arm, took off her robe to carefully wrap it, and then drew two straps to bind it tightly to her back. As long as she could make it back alive to Border Town, Nana could restore the severed arm as good as new.



But... could she really make it back alive?



It had taken her three days to get here alone, and moving with someone on her back would only be slower. If she hurried and accidentally slipped off the path, she wasn't sure she could climb back up.



Wendy's arm continued to bleed, they couldn't hold out for three or four days like this, but Nightingale had no choice—she couldn't possibly abandon Wendy, who had been injured for her sake.



"Do you need help?"



Upon hearing the sudden query, Nightingale unfolded the Mist almost simultaneously, taking a defensive stance.

But there was no one in front of her.

"Don't be nervous, I don't want to fight you."

Nightingale looked up to find the other person floating in mid-air, "Who are you?"

"My name is Lightning, I only joined the Witch Cooperation Association not long ago, and I've been running around outside every day, so it's normal that you don't recognize me." She smiled in a forced casual manner, "But I know you, the famous Nightingale, the assassin from the shadows."

"Did Cara send you?"

"No, no, don't get me wrong," Lightning slowly descended, touching the ground with one foot, "I want to go with you."

For a moment, Nightingale doubted if she had heard wrong, "What?"

"It's what you said, that we should have the freedom to choose our own way of living," she paused, "I choose to go with you, it's that simple."



"Why?" Nightingale had already given up all hope in the Mutual Aid Society, to the extent that she couldn't even fully trust Wendy, and now this girl in front of her—she was indeed still a child, around the age of fourteen or fifteen, similar to Nana. She had neat and tidy golden short hair, a face full of vigor, and her speech brimmed with confidence that belied her age. She wasn't wearing the long robes distributed by the Mutual Aid Society, but instead a set of close-fitting long clothes and trousers that facilitated movement, topped with an old leather jacket full of pockets and patches, so worn that its age was indiscernible. Finally, she had two rough leather belts around her waist that seemed to have been scavenged from somewhere. At first glance, she could be mistaken for a boy.



"Because of those things you talked about, the black machines that puff out white steam, the ones that turn into stone lime gray powder when wet, and the snow blades that can burst out with thunderous roars, I want to go see them," she declared, her head held high. "I am determined to become an explorer, so naturally, I want to go to interesting places."



What kind of reason is that... Nightingale was stunned. It sounded utterly nonsensical, but that sense was insistently telling her that the other party wasn't lying.



"I don't understand... If you want to be an adventurer, why join the Mutual Aid Society?"



"Not an adventurer, an explorer!" Lightning emphasized, "I'm not like those people who do things just for money. Those so-called adventurers are nothing more than jackals willing to do any dirty work. An explorer acts only out of interest! As for why I joined the Mutual Aid Society..." She spoke with righteous indignation, "Isn't seeking the Holy Mountain a great adventure? But Cara has no understanding of the spirit of exploration; she's completely obsessed with that ancient book, forcibly associating anything we find on the road with what's written in the book. Some stone gate rising from the ground was nothing more than a couple of weathered stone pillars. If she continues like this, she'll never find the real Holy Mountain. An explorer must honestly record everything they see. Following a map blindly is not what an explorer should do; that's something my father always stressed!"



Although Nightingale was very curious about who her father was to have raised such an oddly thinking daughter, she knew that now was not the time for idle talk; Wendy's life was hanging by a thread. Since the other party harbored no ill will, having an extra helper was a good thing.



"Is your ability to fly?"



"Mm-hmm," Lightning nodded, "Even if I have to carry you two, I can move like the wind."



"Then I'll have to trouble you." Nightingale quickly tied Wendy to her back, then climbed onto Lightning's back, wrapping her arms around her chest.



"Ugh... it's really heavy," Lightning gritted her teeth as she slowly ascended, "I think, probably, maybe, I can't move forward like the wind anymore."

...

The two of them alternated in their journey; when Lightning exhausted her strength, Nightingale would carry her and traverse through the mist. Once her strength recovered, Nightingale would cling to her back, letting her fly forward.



Only when both of them were completely worn out and had to stop to rest would Nightingale try to ask her some basic questions—about her father, her family.



Lightning called her father the greatest explorer in the world, his footprints covering the entire ocean. He owned a fleet of ocean-going ships, and the crew affectionately called him Thunder. Her mother had passed away early when she was young, so she didn't leave many memories. During a voyage amidst storms and sudden downpours, the ship hit a reef and capsized, and she was washed up on a small island by the ocean currents, losing contact with her father. On the island, with the knowledge and skills her father had taught her, Lightning survived for nearly two months, and awakened as a witch in winter.



Afterward, she headed west, flew across the strait to the southern boundary of Greycastle, and after several turns of events, finally joined the Witch Cooperation Association. She felt that as long as she persisted in exploring, one day, she would be able to reunite with her father amidst some marvelous sights—if he was still alive.



Nightingale was not able to obtain much useful information from these conversations; her ability could only determine whether the other party was lying, but not the veracity of the content. In other words, if someone believed wholeheartedly and claimed that the sun was square, her ability would still judge it as true.



However, some information could still be inferred, such as that she must have been born into a wealthy family—a family struggling to make ends meet wouldn't have the leisure to go on adventures, and owning a fleet of ocean-going ships also matched this deduction. Thus, a wealthy overseas merchant might very well be Thunder's true identity. And Lightning's golden hair didn't seem like the lineage of the kingdom's mainland, but rather more like those from across the sea, the people of the Fjords.



During this time, Wendy had woken up a few times, and Nightingale had to put in a lot of effort to get her to drink a few sips of water, after which she would quickly fall into a coma again. Feeling the other's body temperature getting lower and lower, Nightingale became increasingly anxious.



Having taken turns to travel without rest, the two of them completed the canyon path, which normally required three days, in just a day and a half. At the entrance, the horses obtained from the prince were still tied where they had been left, with most of the wheat straw piled in front of them eaten.



Nightingale, carrying Wendy on her back, mounted one of the horses and, leading Lightning, headed towards Border Town without stopping.
