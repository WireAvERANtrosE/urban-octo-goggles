## The Purifier
Maine stood on a raised hillside, looking out at the city in the distance.

The last time he was here, Wolfheart City was nothing like it is now—it had walls built of snow stone from the Kingdom of Everwinter, which were neat and pristine, like the fangs of a newborn wolf. In just three short months, it had completely changed its appearance. The damaged parts had been filled in with local black boulders, and where repairs couldn't be made in time, wooden frames and planks were erected. The flowing bloodstains had seeped into the crevices of the stones, staining them with a reddish-brown tint.

From a distance, the walls of the city now looked rough and filthy, like the weathered fangs of an old wolf. But compared to before, they now resembled the fangs of a predator even more—for it is only after tearing into prey that they become truly chilling.

The Church's army encamped about five miles outside Wolfheart City, and because they had to be wary of Queen Clearwater's forces attacking the Old Holy City, this time the scale was actually smaller than the last. There were about five thousand men each in the Judgement Army and the logistics team, and the God's Punishment Army numbered around eight hundred. But with the top-secret siege weapons and the Purifiers, Maine was fully confident in capturing this den of the Wolf King.

"Bishop, the 'Siege Beasts' have been positioned and are ready to commence the attack at any time," a priest reported as he ran up to the top of the hill.

"And the Purifiers controlling them?"

"They are also ready."

Maine raised his spyglass to observe the position of the 'Siege Beasts'—two giant steel monstrosities were crouched in the fields two miles from the royal city, surrounded by barriers, with thatched roofs on top. If one didn't get close, it would be hard to notice the fierce and bizarre design of these weapons.

Moving his gaze forward, he saw the ranks of the God's Punishment Army. They were all converted from the Church's most devout followers, standing motionless in the autumn wind. Only the enemies who had clashed with them knew the terrifying power these extraordinary warriors possessed. Unfortunately, they could not act on their own and had to fight under the orders of their commanders, who never showed themselves publicly within the Church. During combat, they would disguise themselves as members of the God's Punishment Army, blending in with the ranks. Apart from the three Archbishops and the Pope, no one knew their true identities.



"Very well," Mayne nodded in satisfaction, "return to your position and wait for the attack horn to blow."

"Yes, my lord."

Next would be the Purifiers under His Holiness the Pope.

Thinking of those two witches, he couldn't help but frown deeply; they were completely different from the other witches raised by the Church. Even during the march and battle, they still did as they pleased. If it were his own Purifiers, they would undoubtedly be punished with whipping, but in the Church's hierarchy, they were on equal footing with the bishops, and Mayne could not command those two—the Pope had only sent two Purifiers to "assist" him in battle, not to "obey" his orders.

However, he also understood that to completely eliminate the hidden dangers, the assistance of their power was essential.

The bishop walked down the hillside and came to a tent at the edge of the camp. Lifting the tent flap, as expected, it was empty inside.

"Where are Jeluo and Isabella?" he asked the Judgement Army soldiers guarding the entrance.

"The two ladies are interrogating prisoners. They should be on the east side of the camp now," the latter replied, "There's an open space over there; you can see it if you walk over. Do you need me to call them for you?"

If you could call them, I wouldn't have come here myself. And it's the prisoner game again... Haven't they grown tired of it yet? Mayne said with a stern face, "No need, I'll go and see for myself."



He quickly found the place mentioned by the guard.

In the middle of the open ground stood two women. One of them leaned forward, whispering something into the ear of one of the three captives whose hands were tied behind their backs. Her expression was gentle and focused, her white hair and the hem of her robe dancing in the wind, like a flawless elf. The other woman had an impressive figure and golden curly hair, occasionally letting out crisp and pleasant laughter.

"Order the Judgement Army surrounding us to leave immediately," Mayne instructed the Chief Inquisitor at his side, "and the same goes for those in charge of the prisoners. Tell them to disregard this matter."

"Understood."

The golden-haired witch also noticed the commotion here. She greeted her companion and then walked quickly over.

"Your Excellency, the Bishop," she said with a slight bow, "why did you send the audience away? The trial is about to begin."

"Lady Isabella," he nodded in response, "a full-scale assault on Wolfheart City is about to commence. At this point, questioning the captives is meaningless, especially since these people are just scouts we captured along the way, with pitifully little intelligence. If possible, I hope you and Jelo can immediately rush to the front lines."

"Don't worry. Since we're here, we won't let an important enemy slip away," Isabella said with a shrug, "As for the trial... I can’t stop her. Why not take this opportunity to join as an observer? It won't take much time anyway."



"The same as before?"

"Yes, the rules are basically the same," she said with a smile, "Agatha loves this kind of game the most."

"Then let's start." Damn it, Maine's face was expressionless, but inside he was seething with anger. Calling it a trial game was actually more like a game of cat and mouse. The captive must escape the area designated by the opponent or defeat the witch to have a slim chance of survival—a chance that was incredibly faint, merely bait to entice the mouse into a desperate struggle. It seemed achievable, but in reality, it was out of reach.

He dismissed the Judgement Army responsible for protecting and monitoring the Purified, also with this intention in mind—this process was not fair at all, and the actions of the other party were not in line with purity. Witnessing it often might shake their faith in the Church.

Once he took over as the Pope, he would have to properly teach them the importance of obeying orders.

At this moment, Agatha had already untied the ropes on the captive's body, and at the same time spread her hands to show that she was not carrying any weapons. In front of the captive were a long sword, a curved knife, and a light crossbow.

"Come, fight or flee, follow your own heart," she said with a beaming smile, her tone still gentle, "Only God can judge."

One of them clenched his teeth and suddenly picked up the crossbow from the ground, shooting directly at the nearby Purified, then without caring whether he hit or not, his other hand had already grabbed the long sword, swinging it forward in a horizontal slash. The whole action was done in one go, clearly not the skill of a militia.

However, the blade didn't cut anything; the Purified stepped back two paces, easily dodging the ambush. When he looked up, he couldn't help but be stunned— the bolt had been caught in the mouth of the other party, like holding a harmless twig.



Sylvie spat out the crossbow bolt and smiled, "Please continue."

The captive's eyes widened, his hands trembling slightly. Mayne could tell that the courage he had mustered with difficulty was nearly exhausted. Even if the fight continued, he probably only had one last strike left.

As expected, after hesitating for a moment, he let out a cathartic roar and charged towards the unarmed woman with his sword raised.

But the strike was too crude, and even with his eyes closed, Mayne could guess the outcome—judging from the brief half-month he had been in contact with Sylvie, the ability of this Pure was unfathomably deep. She was not an Extraordinary, but she possessed a combat talent no less than that of an Extraordinary witch. This talent did not lie in strength or resilience but in an almost magical skill.

Even without using magic, she was a formidable warrior.

Sylvie slightly shifted her body and easily dodged her opponent's chop. Then, with those seemingly delicate hands, she grasped the captive's head and, using his forward momentum, gently led him along. There was a light crack, and the man went limp as if all the bones in his body had been removed.

She turned her head to look at the remaining two, "You're next."
