## Purifier
Maine stood on a curved hillside, gazing far into the city ahead.

The last time he visited, Wolfsheart City was nothing like it is now—its walls were built from the snow-white stones of the Kingdom of Everwinter, neat and pristine, like the fresh fangs of a wolf. In just three short months, it had completely changed its appearance. The damaged parts were filled with local black boulders, and where there was no time for repairs, wooden frames and planks were erected. The flowing traces of blood had seeped into the crevices of the stones, staining them with a brownish-red hue.

From a distance, the city walls now looked rough and covered in filth, like the weathered tooth of an old wolf. But compared to before, it looked more like the fangs of a predator—only after tearing through its prey would it become even more chilling.

The army of the Church had encamped about five miles outside Wolfsheart City to prevent Queen Clearwater from sending troops to attack the Old Holy City, so the scale was actually smaller than last time. There were five thousand men each in the Judgement Army and the supply troops, with around eight hundred in the God's Punishment Army. But with the top-secret siege weapons and the Purifiers, Maine was fully confident in capturing this lair of the Wolf King.

"Bishop, the 'Siege Beasts' have been positioned and are ready to commence the attack at any time," a priest ran up to the top of the hill and reported to him.

"What about the Purifiers controlling them?"

"They are also ready."

Maine raised his telescope to observe the position of the 'Siege Beasts'—he saw two massive steel beasts lying in the fields two miles away from the royal city, flanked by planks and topped with straw sheds. Without a close look, it would be hard to detect the fierce and strange design of these weapons.

Moving his gaze forward, he saw the ranks of the God's Punishment Army. They were all transformed from the most devout believers of the Church, standing motionless in the autumn wind. Only those who had crossed swords with them would know the terrifying power of these extraordinary warriors. Regrettably, they could not act on their own and had to fight through the commands issued by their commanders. These commanders never appeared publicly in the Church and always fought disguised as members of the God's Punishment Army, blending into the ranks. Except for the three Archbishops and the Pope, no one knew their true identities.



"Very well," Mayne nodded with satisfaction, "Return to your position and wait for the attack horn to sound."

"Yes, my lord."

Next were His Holiness' Purifiers.

Thinking of those two witches, he couldn't help but frown deeply. They were completely different from the other witches raised by the Church; even during marches and battles, they still did whatever they pleased. If it had been his own Purifiers, they would have definitely received a whipping as punishment. But in the Church's hierarchy, they were equal to a bishop, and Mayne could not command those two—His Holiness had only sent two Purifiers to "assist" him in battle, not to "obey" his orders.

However, he also understood that to completely remove the hidden dangers, their power was indispensable.



The bishop walked down the hillside and came to a tent on the outskirts of the camp. Lifting the tent flap, as expected, the tent was empty.



"Where are Jaela and Isabella?" he asked the Judgment Army guarding the entrance.



"The two lords are interrogating prisoners. They should be on the east side of the camp," the latter replied, "There is a flat open space over there. You can see it if you go there. Do you need me to call them for you?"



If you could call them, I wouldn't have come here myself. And it's the prisoner game again... Haven't they tired of it? Mayne said with a stern face, "No need, I'll go take a look."



He quickly found the place mentioned by the guard.

In the center of the open space stood two women. One was leaning forward, whispering something into the ears of three prisoners whose hands were tied behind their backs. Her expression was gentle and focused, her long white hair and robe fluttering in the wind, like a flawless elf. The other woman had a proud figure and golden curly hair, occasionally letting out a crisp and pleasant laughter.



"Have the watching Judgement Army around here leave immediately," Mayne instructed the Judgement Chief by his side, who was acting as a guard. "The same goes for those in charge of watching the prisoners. Tell them to disregard this matter."



"As you wish."



The blonde witch also noticed the commotion here. She greeted her companion and then quickly walked over.



"Your Excellency, the Bishop," the newcomer bowed slightly, "why did you send the audience away? The trial is about to start."



"Lady Isabella," he nodded in response, "a full-scale assault on Wolfheart City is about to commence. Interrogating prisoners now is meaningless, especially since these people are merely scouts captured along the way, with pitifully little intelligence. If possible, I hope you and Jelo can head to the front lines immediately."



"Don't worry, since we have come, we will not let an important enemy escape," Isabella spread her hands, "As for the trial... I can't stop her. How about you join as an audience for once? It won't take too much time, anyway."



"Just like before?"

"Yes, the rules are basically the same," she smiled. "Jezero loves these kinds of games the most."

"Then let's start." Damn it, Mayne's face was expressionless, but inside he was seething with anger. Calling it a trial game was less accurate than calling it a cat catching a mouse. The prisoner had to escape the area designated by the opponent or defeat the witch to gain a glimmer of hope for survival—and this hope was extremely slim, merely a bait to entice the mouse to struggle desperately. It seemed feasible, but in reality, it was unattainable.

He had dismissed the Judgement Army responsible for guarding and monitoring the Purifiers, and his intention was also here—this process was not fair or just at all, and the opponent's actions were not consistent with purity. Seeing too much of it might shake their faith in the Church.

Once he took over as the Pope, he would surely have to teach them the importance of obeying commands.

At this moment, Jezero had already untied the ropes on the prisoner and spread her hands to show that she was not carrying any weapons. In front of the prisoner were a long sword, a curved knife, and a light crossbow.

"Come on, fight or flee, follow your heart," she said with a smile, her tone still gentle, "Only the gods can make the judgement."

One of them gritted his teeth and suddenly picked up the crossbow from the ground, shooting directly at the nearby Purifier, then, regardless of whether it hit or not, his other hand had already grabbed the long sword, swinging it forward in a horizontal slash. The whole action was done in one breath, clearly not something a militia would be capable of.

However, the blade did not hit anything; the Purifier stepped back two steps, easily avoiding the surprise attack. When he looked up, he couldn't help but be stunned, only to see that the crossbow bolt was bitten in the opponent's mouth, as if holding a harmless twig.



Mayne watched as the captive's hands trembled slightly, his hard-won courage dwindling to its last vestiges. Indeed, after a moment's hesitation, he let out a cathartic roar and charged toward the unarmed woman with his sword raised. But the attack was too crude; even with his eyes closed, Mayne could predict the outcome—having observed her for the past half month, he knew that the Pure Witch's abilities seemed bottomless. She was not a Transcendent, yet she possessed a combat talent no less than that of the extraordinary witches. This talent did not lie in strength or resilience but in an almost magical skill.



Even without using magic, she was a fearsome warrior.



With a slight tilt of her body, Jelo easily dodged the clumsy slash. Her seemingly delicate hands clasped the captive's head, and with the momentum of his charge, she guided it with a gentle tug. A crisp crack sounded, and the man collapsed, as if all the bones in his body had been suddenly removed.



She turned her head to face the remaining two, "You're next."
