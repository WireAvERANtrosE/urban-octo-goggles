## Homeland
The ocean was like a vast expanse of azure land, only flatter.



If Maggie were here, she would be chirping away to herself, reporting how far away the island still was. Now, all she could hear were the sounds of the waves slapping against the ship's hull. Although it became somewhat monotonous after a while, for the sailors, it was a lucky rhythm, signifying that today was good weather for sailing.



Hmm, there's another sound now, Ashes thought. Footsteps pressed on the old teak deck, making a slight creaking noise—someone was approaching her.



"I didn't expect you all to actually settle down on Sleeping Island," a white-haired old man came up beside her, resting his hands on the railing. "It might look big, but most of the land gets flooded during high tide. It's not suitable for settling down. Why not live on Crescent Moon Bay? It's the second largest island in the Fjords, and there are still many uninhabited spaces there."



Jack One-Eye, the captain of the Beauty of the Sea, had an eyepatch that completely covered his left eye, just as his name suggested. He was one of the few captains willing to transport goods for witches—although the people of the Fjords didn't harbor the same hatred for witches as the mainland kingdoms, they were equally disinterested in dealing with outsiders.



"Not everyone is as willing to deal with witches as you," Ashes said with a smile. "Sleeping Island does get flooded, but it's exactly because of this that, despite being the third largest in the Fjords, it remains uninhabited."



"Being the third largest doesn't mean it has the third largest habitable area," Captain Jack shrugged. "If it's not fit for living, then its size is meaningless, like the Scorched Islands."



"The thing witches are best at is changing nature," she said earnestly. "Besides, this island will become our home. As long as there is no suppression from the Church, we can create a completely different world, a... brand new world." She paused for a moment. "How long has it been since you last visited Sleeping Island?"



The captain took off his hat and scratched the back of his head. "About a month, I guess. Last time, I delivered a group of witches along with a full hold of pearl rice. Honestly, the way those girls frolicked on the ship made my crew gape in astonishment. You know how hard it is for young lads to drift on the sea, like a volcano about to erupt at any moment. Luckily, I stopped them in time. Otherwise, my beloved ship would have been in trouble."



Ashes automatically ignored the latter part of his words, "A month's time is enough for earth-shaking changes, Captain. I bet that the Sleeping Island you'll see this time will be vastly different from what you remember."

"Really?" Jack whistled, "Then I'm looking forward to it... Wait, what's that?" He leaned out over the ship's side, tilting his head forward, "Monkey! Up the mast, there seems to be something up ahead!"

The sailor known as Monkey quickly climbed to the top of the mast and lifted his spyglass, "Boss, that should be an island!"

"An island? What nonsense are you talking about," the captain took out a compass to look, "How could there be any other islands near us besides Sleeping Island?"

"But it really is an island, boss, I swear!" 

"Your swear is worth nothing, let me see." Jack removed his hat.

"No, no, no, boss, you better not come up here, it's windy," Monkey observed for a while longer, "By the Three Gods!" he cried out in disbelief, "I know now, that's Sleeping Island! It's gotten taller!"

...

As the Beauty of the Sea slowly approached the dock of Sleeping Island, everyone on board could hardly believe their eyes.



The towering island stood above the sea level like a small mountain, its cliffs sheer and steep, with a distance of several tens of meters to the top.

This was Ashes' first time arriving at the island, and her reaction was much calmer than most, which in Captain Jack's eyes became a symbol of composure and confidence.

"You win," he sighed, "I never imagined you could make an island rise up like this. No wonder the Church loathes witches so deeply; this is nearly comparable to the divine."

"Uncle Jack, it's not like you said, making the island rise," the little girl waiting at the dock said with a smile, "We just built a 'wall' around Sleeping Island, that's all. You'll see when you come in with us." After saying this, she turned to Ashes and bowed, "You've finally returned, Lady Tilly has been talking about you for so long."

Ashes patted her head, "No need for formalities, Molly. It looks like I'll have to trouble you to carry some things later on."

"I've got it covered," the girl said, patting her chest.

After the sailors moved the food from the cabin to the dock, Molly summoned her magical servant—a pale blue sphere with two arms that could change at will. It scooped up more than a dozen bags of food, then the arms transformed into a net, securing the bags tightly, and floated mid-air. "Let's go," she said proudly.

"Oh, what a convenient ability," the captain praised, clapping his hands, "You see, lads, so many of you and yet you're no match for one little girl."

The dock was built halfway up the island, and the group followed the spiraling staircase upwards. When they reached the top of the island, Ashes instantly understood the meaning of "building a wall around the island."



It wasn't that the island had risen, but rather, they had raised the outline of the island—a whole Sleeping Island had become a basin, surrounded by a thick edge. This edge was the city wall Moriel mentioned. On the inside of the wall were many stairs leading downwards, and at the bottom was the main body of Sleeping Island.



"This... is incredible," Captain Jack smacked his lips and said, "You've turned a sea island into a fortress. Just imagine, what would it be like here during high tide? My goodness, you would be living below sea level!"



"Indeed," Moriel covered her mouth and chuckled, "That's why we have two docks, one built under the sea, and one built at sea level. Of course, it would also be correct to say one is built at sea level, and the other in mid-air."



Walking to the center of the island, various houses had already been built here. Unlike the common wooden or brick houses, these buildings seemed to grow straight out of the ground, with their bases fully integrated with the earth. Without a doubt, they were all masterpieces of Lotus, along with the city wall.



"Ashes, that house at the very north is Lady Tilly's palace. I'll take the captain to deliver the goods; you don't need to accompany me anymore. Go and see her first," the little girl waved.



Ashes nodded, said goodbye to the two, and quickly walked towards the north. Along the way, she saw many familiar faces, all of whom bowed to her or waved with a smile. The home of the witches, this phrase grew brighter in Ashes' heart, filling her with strength.



And the creator of this home was Tilly Wimbledon, the Witch Queen.



Different from the royal palace, this spacious house had no guards, nor were there locked doors. Ashes went straight through the front courtyard and into the hall, only to see a familiar figure before her.



She tiptoed up behind the person and playfully covered the gray-haired woman's eyes with her hands.



"I noticed you the moment you were at the door," the other person laughed, "Don't forget how I picked you out from the crowd."

Extraordinaries possess the ability to sense magic, and the sensing between Extraordinaries is even more intense. This connection, born from magic, is like an invisible bond, firmly linking her with Tilly.

"I'm back," Ashes said softly.

"Mm," Tilly responded cheerfully, "Welcome home."
