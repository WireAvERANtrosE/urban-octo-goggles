## Homeland
The ocean is like a vast expanse of azure land, only flatter.

If Maggie were here, she would be chirping incessantly, reporting how far away we are from the island. Now, all I hear is the sound of waves slapping against the ship's hull. Although it becomes somewhat monotonous after a while, it's a fortunate rhythm for the crew; it means today is good weather for sailing.

Hmm, now there's another sound, Ashes thought. Footsteps pressed on the old teak deck, making a slight creaking noise—someone was walking towards her.

"I didn't expect you to actually settle down on Sleeping Island," an old man with speckled white hair came up to her, resting his hands on the railing. "It might look large, but most of the land gets submerged at high tide and isn't suitable for living. Why not settle in Crescent Moon Bay? It's the second-largest island in the Fjords and still has a lot of uninhabited land."

Jack One-Eye, the captain of the Beauty of the Lake, lived up to his name with a patch covering his entire left eye. He was one of the few captains willing to transport supplies for witches—the people of the Fjords might not despise witches as much as those on the mainland kingdoms, but they were equally reluctant to deal with outsiders.

"Not everyone is as willing to deal with witches as you are," Ashes said with a smile. "Sleeping Island indeed gets flooded, but that's precisely why it remains an uninhabited wasteland, despite being the third-largest in the Fjords."

"Third-largest doesn't mean it has the third-largest habitable area," Captain Jack shrugged. "No matter how big it is, it's pointless if it's uninhabitable, like the Scorched Archipelago."

"What witches are best at is changing nature," she said earnestly. "Besides, this island will become our home. Without the Church's oppression, we can create a completely different world, a... new world." She paused for a moment. "How long has it been since you last visited Sleeping Island?"

The captain took off his hat and scratched the back of his head, "About a month, I reckon. Last time I brought a group of witches and a hold full of treasured pearl rice over. Honestly, the way those girls frolicked on the ship left my crew dumbstruck. You know it's not easy for young lads drifting at sea—it's like a volcano ready to erupt at any moment. Thankfully, I stopped them in time. Otherwise, my beloved ship would have suffered."



Ashes automatically ignored the latter part of his words. "A month is enough time for earth-shaking changes, Captain. I bet that the Sleeping Island you see this time will be completely different from what you remember."



"Is that so?" Jack whistled, "Then I look forward to it... wait, what's that?" He leaned out over the ship's side and looked ahead, "Monkey! Up the mast, it looks like there's something ahead!"



The sailor known as Monkey swiftly climbed to the top of the mast and lifted his spyglass, "Boss, that should be an island!"



"An island? What nonsense are you talking about," the captain pulled out his compass and took a look, "How could there be any other islands near us besides Sleeping Island?"



"But it really is an island, boss, I swear it!"



"Your swearing is worth nothing, let me see." Jack took off his hat.



"No, no, no, boss, you better not come up, it's windy here," Monkey observed again for a good while, "By the Three Gods!" He cried out incredulously, "I know now, that's Sleeping Island! It's gotten taller!"



...

As the Beauty slowly approached the dock of Sleeping Island, everyone on board could hardly believe their eyes.



The towering island stood above the sea level like a small mountain, with cliffs that were straight and steep, stretching up to several tens of meters to the top.



This was Ashes' first time reaching the island, and she was much calmer than most, which in Captain Jack's eyes was a symbol of composure and confidence.



"You've won," he remarked, "I didn't expect that you could make an island rise from the sea. No wonder the Church loathes witches so much; this is almost comparable to the divine."



"Uncle Jack, it's not like what you said about making the island rise," the little girl waiting at the dock laughed, "We just built a 'wall' around Sleeping Island, that's all. You'll understand once you come in and take a look." After saying this, she turned to Ashes and curtsied, "You've finally returned, Lady Tilly has been talking about you for a long time."



Ashes patted her head, "No need for such formalities, Molly. I'll need your help with moving some things later."



"Leave it to me," the girl declared, patting her chest.



After the sailors moved the food from the cabin to the dock, Molly summoned her magical servant—a pale blue sphere with two arms that could change shape at will. It scooped up more than a dozen bags of grain, and then the arms formed a net, securely holding the bags as it floated mid-air. "Let's go," she said proudly.



"Oh, what a convenient ability," the captain said, clapping his hands, "See that, lads? So many of you and still not a match for a little girl."



The dock was built halfway up the island, and the group followed the stairs winding upwards. Upon reaching the top of the island, Ashes instantly understood the meaning of "building a wall around the island."



It wasn't the island that had risen, but rather they had elevated the outline of the island—a whole Sleepy Island had turned into a basin, surrounded by a thick rim. And this rim was the wall that Molly spoke of, with many stairs on the inside leading down, and at the bottom was the true body of Sleepy Island.



"This... is incredible," Captain Jack smacked his lips, "you've turned a sea island into a fortress. Just imagine, what would it be like here during high tide? My god, you would be living below sea level!"



"Indeed," Molly laughed with her hand covering her mouth, "that's why we have two docks, one built under the sea, and one above the surface. Of course, it would also be correct to say that one is built on the surface, and the other in mid-air."



Arriving at the center of the island, various kinds of houses had already been built. Unlike the common wooden or brick houses, these buildings seemed as if they had grown out from the ground, with their bases and the ground completely connected as one. Without a doubt, they, along with the wall, were all masterpieces of Lotus.



"Ashes, the house at the very northern end is Lady Tilly's palace. I will take the captain to deliver the goods, you don't need to accompany me anymore, go see the lady first," the little girl waved.



Ashes nodded, said goodbye to the two, and quickly walked north. Along the way, she saw many familiar faces, who all bowed to her with respect or waved with a smile. The home of the witches, this term grew ever more luminous in Ashes' heart, filling her with strength.



And the creator of this home was Tilly Wimbledon, the Witch Queen.



Different from the royal palace, this spacious house had no guards, nor locked doors. Ashes walked straight through the front yard and into the hall, only to see a familiar figure in front of her.



She tiptoed up behind the silver-haired woman and covered her eyes with her hands.



"I noticed you the moment you were at the door," the other party said with a smile, "Don't forget how I picked you out from the crowd."



Extraordinaries possess the ability to sense magic, and the sensing between Extraordinaries is even stronger. This connection, born from magic, is like an invisible bond that tightly links her with Tilly.



"I'm back," Ashes said softly.



"Mm," Tilly responded heartily, "Welcome home."
