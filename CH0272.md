## North Slope Mine
As they moved deeper into the mine, the environment within the cave became more humid.

Sylvie carefully avoided the water droplets falling from the ceiling, holding a torch and moving slowly through the cave—even without light, the Eye of Truth would not be hindered by the darkness, but this was done simply to conserve magic power.

"We've reached the fork," Nightingale, who was leading the way, stopped, "Which mine shaft is this again?"

"The first fork at the 23rd mine shaft, second entry." Lightning took out her notebook and glanced at it.

"I hope this is the end," Sylvie muttered as she opened her eyes fully shaped by magic power, "Left side... leaves the mining area, no ore. Right side... the same."

Lightning noted the results, "Then, there is only one more door in this mine shaft left to check."

"Let's go." Nightingale moved from the front of the group to the back again, leading everyone back the way they came. Her ability seemed to be more than just invisibility, Sylvie could only faintly perceive the changes in Nightingale's magic power, but she couldn't capture her figure and movements. According to Lightning's introduction, she was the most powerful combat witch in the Witch Union.

This was probably the reason why Roland had her follow him—there were rumors that this mine was once the lair of an ancient monster, and there had been several incidents of miners disappearing before. Before they set out, His Highness the Prince had repeatedly instructed them to be careful and cautious, and if they encountered an uncertain situation, they should exit the mine first and then report back to him.

Sylvie didn't take it seriously, nothing could escape the detection of the Eye of Truth, even the animal carcasses and writhing soft-bodied worms in the stone walls, she could see them all clearly.



The "Exploration Team" consisted of four people: herself, Nightingale, Lightning, and a young girl named Lucia. Whenever she discovered an ore, Lucia would transform it into various fragments and then carefully sort and pocket them, saying they were to be identified by His Highness.



Lightning was responsible for drawing the map of the mine's terrain. Of course, in her own words, no adventure could do without her—this proud tone reminded Sylvie of the captain who was temporarily stationed on Sleeping Island.



Cave No. 23 was a huge abyss near the bottom of the mining area. After going hundreds of steps deep, it split into three forks. Following these forks deeper would reveal even more branches, but at that point, they would have nearly extended beyond the mining area's boundaries, with very little chance of containing ore veins, so they would only go as far as this step.



Returning to the original fork, which was the "door" marked by Lightning, Sylvie used her ability to observe the situation of the three doors of Cave No. 23.



The wider the range of the True Sight, the greater the magic power consumption and the heavier the burden on her body. Therefore, she chose to observe once at each fork, exploring one passage at a time.



"Three more doors... Hmm, no ore, and at the end, there's..." she paused, "five branches, one of which seems to loop back downwards."



"Downwards?" Lightning repeated.



"Indeed," Sylvie confirmed after another look. The narrow passage didn't go down long before it turned and headed straight towards the mining area. When she tried to continue following this branch with her sight, a strong dizzy spell surged into her mind, interrupting her connection with the Magic Eye. "I think it might lead to an ore deposit."



However, this explanation was far-fetched. The intricate caves within the North Slope Mine were obviously not man-made and did not specifically follow the ores—previously, an unidentified ore vein was found sandwiched between two branches. If not for the True Sight being able to penetrate obstacles, it would have been impossible to discover the pile of metallic stones hidden beneath the rock walls and soil.



"Whatever it is, we'll know once we take a look." Nightingale shrugged her shoulders.



The group filed into the third door of the cave and, after about a quarter of an hour, reached the end of the passage.



They saw that the passage here split into five, with the narrowest one no longer passable on foot, barely wide enough to crawl through. The strange passage that Sylvie had seen before was located in the middle of the five forks, with the terrain turning sharply downwards, forming a steep slope almost perpendicular to the ground where they stood.



"It looks quite deep," Nightingale shone a torch down it, "I always feel that the caves here bear some resemblance to those we saw in the Impassable Mountain Range cliffs."



"Let's hurry back once we've checked it out," Lucia couldn't help but tighten her grip on Nightingale's arm, "I don't really like this place... I always feel as if something in the cave is staring at us."



"There's nothing in the cave but mud and rocks," Sylvie said, although she didn't like this quiet and damp place either. However, her ability told her that there was no danger, "All four passages to the left and right are devoid of minerals, outside of the mining area," she quickly scanned the straight forks and then turned her gaze to the middle one, pausing slightly, "...Hmm?"



"What's wrong?" Lightning asked.



"I... can't see what's below."



"Can't see?" the little girl said in surprise, "Is it because you're too tired that your ability failed? Rest for a while."



"No, it's not a problem of ability," Sylvie closed her eyes, and when she opened them again, everything was still pitch black, as if her vision had been stripped away. Enduring the headache, she tried to expand her field of vision further, but the result was still the same—the surrounding soil was clearly discernible, but the center was completely enveloped by an endless darkness, thick like ink that would not dissolve. "Something is blocking my spying."



"Everyone stay here and don't move," Nightingale drew out two shining silver weapons, "I'll go down and check the situation, I'll be right back."



"Don't go!" Sylvie pressed her throbbing forehead to stop her, "Only one thing can produce this effect. Even if you go, you will fall into danger."



"What is it?"



"God's Punishment Stones," she said through clenched teeth, "There are God's Punishment Stones under the ground, and it's the kind that can cover an entire area!"



...

When Roland learned of this news, he immediately assembled the First Army soldiers to enter the North Slope Mine.



And the final investigation result was exactly as Sylvie had guessed—the deep caves at the bottom of the mine harbored a massive amount of God's Punishment Stones.



After confirming there was no danger, Roland also entered Cave Twenty-Three with the protection of his personal guards, as he too wanted to witness for himself what the God's Punishment Stones that could forbid the entire bottom of the mountain looked like.



"Your Highness, please be careful," Carter reminded, "the exit is just ahead."

"We can't use magic here, it's safer for you to stay above," Roland turned back to look at Anna, Nightingale, and Lightning following behind him. "Wouldn't it be better to learn from Sylvie?"

"Even without magic, I'm stronger than you. If you can come, of course, I can too," Nightingale pouted.

"Where there's adventure, there I am," Lightning declared with her chest puffed out.

Anna said nothing, just gazing intently at Roland. Seeing those clear eyes reflecting the light of the torches, Roland knew that nothing he said would make a difference.

"Alright," he sighed, "you must stay close to me, don't wander off."

Following the sloping cave to the end, Roland immediately understood what the Chief Knight meant by 'the exit.'

The view before him suddenly opened up, revealing a profoundly immense cavern.

Even without the aid of the torchlight, he could clearly see the full extent of the cave— the light came from God's Stones of Retaliation, which rose from the ground like crystal prisms. Each was about twenty to thirty meters in diameter, like neon towers, standing tall before him.
