## North Slope Mine
The deeper they went into the mine, the damper the environment became inside the cavern.

Sylvie carefully avoided the droplets falling from above, holding a torch as she slowly moved forward in the cave—Even without light, the Eye of True Sight would not be hindered by darkness, she did this merely to conserve mana.

"We've come to a fork," Nightingale, who was leading the way, stopped, "Which number is this cave again?"

"The first fork of the twenty-third cave, section two," Lightning took out her notebook to check.

"I hope this is the end," Sylvie muttered as she opened her eyes completely shaped by magic, "Left side... exits the mining area, no ore. Right side... the same."

Lightning recorded the findings, "Then, there is only one last door left to check in this cave."

"Let's go." Nightingale moved from the front to the back of the group, leading everyone back the way they came. Her abilities seemed to be more than just invisibility; Sylvie could only vaguely see the changes in Nightingale's magic, but couldn't capture her figure or movements. According to Lightning's introduction, she was the most powerful combat witch in the Witch Union.

Perhaps this was why Roland wanted her to follow him—there were rumors that this mine was once the nest of an ancient beast, and there had been several incidents of miners going missing before. Before departing, His Highness the Prince had repeatedly instructed them to be very careful and, if they encountered an uncertain situation, to retreat from the mine first and then report back to him.

Sylvie didn't take it seriously, as no monster could escape the detection of the Eye of True Sight, even the animal carcasses and writhing soft-bodied worms in the stone walls, she could see them all clearly.



The exploration team consisted of four people: herself, Nightingale, Lightning, and a young girl named Lucia. Each time she discovered an ore, Lucia would transform it into various fragments and then carefully sort them into her pockets, saying that they were to be given to His Highness for identification.

Lightning was responsible for drawing the map of the mine's topography. Of course, as she would say, no adventure could do without her—her proud tone reminded Sylvie of the captain who was temporarily stationed on Sleeping Island.

Cave #23 was a huge deep cave near the bottom of the mining area. It split into three separate paths after several hundred steps, and following these paths deeper, one would find even more branches. However, at that point, they would have nearly extended beyond the mining area's scope, with very little chance of containing ore veins, so they would only explore up to there.

Returning to the original fork, which Lightning had recorded as the "door," Sylvie used her ability to observe the situation of the three doors in Cave #23.

The wider the range of the True Sight, the greater the magic power consumed and the heavier the burden on the body, so she chose to observe once at each fork, exploring one passage at a time.

"Three more doors... Hmm, no ores, and at the end there are..." She hesitated, "Five branches, one of which seems to loop back downwards."

"Downwards?" Lightning repeated.

"Indeed," Sylvie looked again. The slender passage went down for a short distance and then made a turn, heading straight for the mining area. When she tried to continue looking down this branch, a strong sense of dizziness surged into her mind, interrupting her connection with the magic eye, "I think it might lead to a vein of ores."

But this explanation was quite far-fetched. The complex caves of the North Slope Mine were clearly not man-made and did not specifically follow the ores—previously, an unidentified vein of ore was found sandwiched between two branches. If not for the True Sight's ability to see through obstacles, it would have been impossible to discover the pile of metallic stones hidden beneath the rock walls and soil.



"Whatever it is, we'll know once we take a look," Nightingale shrugged her shoulders.

The group filed into the third door of the cave and arrived at the end of the passageway after about a quarter of an hour.

There, the passage split into five, with the narrowest one being too small for people to walk through, almost only allowing someone to crawl in. The strange passage that Sylvie had seen before was located in the middle of the five forks, with the terrain turning sharply downward, almost forming a steep slope with the ground where they were standing.

"It looks pretty deep," Nightingale illuminated it with a torch, "I always feel that the caves here are somewhat similar to the ones we saw on the Impassable Mountain Range."

"Let's hurry back after we check it out," Lucia couldn't help but tighten her grip on Nightingale's arm, "I don't really like this place... I always feel like something in the cave is staring at us."

"There's nothing in the cave, just mud and rocks," Sylvie said, although she was not very fond of this quiet and damp place, her ability told her that there was no danger, "All four paths on the left and right are devoid of minerals, outside of the mining area," she quickly scanned the straight passageways and then turned her gaze to the middle one, pausing for a moment, "…Hmm?"

"What's wrong?" Lightning asked.

"I... can't see what's below."

"Can't see?" the young girl exclaimed in surprise, "Is it because you're too tired that your ability failed? Take a rest."



"No, it's not a matter of ability," Sylvie closed her eyes and opened them again, but everything remained pitch-black as if her vision had been stripped away. She endured the headache and tried to extend her field of view further, yet nothing changed—the surrounding soil was clear, but the center was completely enveloped in an endless darkness, thick like ink that wouldn't dissolve. "Something is blocking my spying."



"Everyone, stay here and don't move," Nightingale drew out two gleaming silver weapons, "I'll go down and check the situation. I'll be right back."



"Don't go!" Sylvie pressed her throbbing forehead and stopped her, "There's only one thing that can cause this effect. Even if you go, you'll be in danger."



"What is it?"



"The Divine Stone of Judgement," she said through clenched teeth, "There is a Divine Stone of Judgement underground, and it's the kind that can cover an entire region!"



...

When Roland learned of this, he immediately gathered the First Army soldiers to enter the North Slope Mine.



And the final investigation turned out just as Sylvie had guessed—deep within the mine lay a massive deposit of Divine Stone of Judgement.



After ensuring there was no danger, Roland also entered Cave 23 under the protection of his personal guards, wanting to see for himself what the Divine Stone of Judgement, which could forbid an entire mountain base, actually looked like.



"Your Highness, please be careful," Carter cautioned, "the exit is right ahead."

"We can't use magic here, it's safer for you to stay above," Roland turned back to look at Anna, Nightingale, and Lightning following behind him, "Why not learn from Sylvie?"

"Even without magic, I'm still better than you. If you can go down there, of course, I can too," Nightingale pouted.

"Where there's an adventure, there I am," Lightning said proudly, puffing out her chest.

Anna said nothing, just gazed intently at Roland. Seeing those clear eyes reflecting the torchlight, Roland knew that whatever he said would be pointless.

"Alright," he sighed, "just make sure you stay close to me, and don't wander off."

Following the sloping cave to the end, Roland immediately understood what the Chief Knight meant by "exit."

The view suddenly opened up before him, revealing a profoundly vast cavern.

Even without the need for torchlight, he could clearly see the entirety of the cave—the illumination came from crystal prism-like Divine Stones of Judgement, which rose from the ground, each with a diameter of twenty to thirty meters, resembling towering neon pillars, majestically standing before him.
