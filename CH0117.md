## Pursuit (Part 1)
Carter Lannis witnessed such a battle for the first time.
The massive formation of over three hundred knights was routed without even reaching the edge of the defensive line.
Until the end, they couldn't get within fifty meters—that was the shooting line drawn by His Highness for the musketeer squad, and only when someone crossed the fifty-meter line was everyone allowed to open fire.
Four cannons held the opponents firmly at around one hundred meters. Lying haphazardly between one hundred fifty and one hundred meters were about twenty corpses, and these men were skilled knights just like himself; otherwise, they couldn't have controlled their horses to advance at high speed amidst the roaring of the cannons.
Carter was glad he was not one of them. He had a foreboding that future wars would be very different, and with Roland Wimbledon wielding such formidable power, it was only a matter of time before he would vie for the throne.
A few members of the First Army exhibited symptoms like dizziness and vomiting after seeing the gruesome battlefield, but since it was not close-quarters combat, the shock of killing the enemy with cannons was less intense than killing someone with a blade by hand, so the symptoms were not severe. Carter picked out a group of hunters accustomed to seeing limbs and blood to collect the bodies of the dead while searching for survivors.
As the sun gradually set behind the mountains, Carter looked at the blood-red sky and the cawing of crows rising from the distant woods, suddenly feeling a hint of desolation.
The era of knights had ended.
...

Duke Ryan had yet to recover from his shock.
He didn't understand how he had been defeated, considering that the defensive line seemed as fragile as a cobweb, easily pierced with a mere poke. Yet, his knights scattered as though they had seen the devil himself. He couldn't even blame others since it was his own elite knights who were at the forefront of the rout.
His personal guards had to cut down several men before the swarm of mercenaries gave way and avoided the duke's position, but that was all they could do. No matter how he roared, he couldn't rally his crumbling troops. Left with no choice, Duke Osmond Ryan had to retreat with the flow of people, and this retreat lasted for nearly ten miles.
It wasn't until nightfall that the duke chose a location near the riverbank to set up camp. Only then did the scattered knights and mercenaries start to gather around the torches, though a large number were still missing. To make matters worse, during the retreat, the freemen had unhesitatingly abandoned the carts and food supplies, so tonight, they had to slaughter a few horses to serve as rations.
Within the largest tent in the camp, the nobles of the five major families gathered together, their faces pale as they looked towards Duke Ryan, whose complexion wasn't any better.
"Can anyone tell me what new weapon they used? It has a longer range than crossbows, and it's not like a catapult where you can see the stones being thrown," he glanced at Rayne Mead, "You were also at the front, did you see anything?"
"My lord, I... I am not sure," Rayne held his head, "I just heard the constant booming, and they fell in batches, especially with the last one. The knight at the front seemed to suddenly hit an invisible wall. I saw his body shudder, his head and limbs shattered as if..." he paused to think, "like an egg thrown from the top of a castle."
"Could it be witches?" murmured the Earl of Elk.
"Impossible," the duke frowned, "My knights all wear the Divine Stone of Judgement, witches couldn't possibly harm them. Haven't you hunted witches before? What difference is there between them and ordinary women in the presence of a God's Stone?"

"Right, my lord," Rayne suddenly remembered something, "Before we heard the loud bang, I saw several carts in their formation that looked like pushcarts, with huge iron tubes mounted on them that could emit red light and smoke."
"Iron tubes? Red light and smoke? Isn't that just a firework?" Count Elk questioned in confusion.
The duke, of course, knew what fireworks were. In the past, only the nobles in the capital would use them during major celebrations, but now almost every lord had one or two at the ready. He had a pair of bronze fireworks in his castle that would explode when filled with snow powder. However, the sound of those was far too soft compared to the thunderous roar that had gripped everyone's hearts today.
"Fireworks wouldn't tear knights to pieces," Count Honeysuckle interjected, "No matter what kind of weapon the prince used, we have already been defeated. What should we do next?"
Duke Ryan glanced at him with displeasure, finding the word 'defeat' particularly grating to hear. "We have not been defeated," he emphasized, "A setback in one battle cannot alter the final outcome. As long as we return to the stronghold, I can muster another force while cutting off the trade on the Redwater River. Without food supplies, Border Town won't last a month. As soon as he dares to bring those villagers out, my knights will crush them from the flanks and rear."
Victory would ultimately be his, he thought, but the losses suffered for this were not something a small town could compensate for... The hopes of retaking the North were almost dashed. Damn it! If he could capture Roland Wimbledon, he would surely have him torn to pieces.
"But my lord, the fleet on the Redwater River is not only from Longsong Stronghold, there are also ships from Willow Town, Falling Dragon Ridge, and Redwater City. If we intercept all of them, would that not…" Count Honeysuckle hesitated.
"I'll buy them all," the duke said coldly, "As long as I pay, it doesn't matter who they sell to. Everyone go back to your tents and sleep. We set out at dawn tomorrow. Knights with horses will move with us, those without will stay behind to lead the mercenaries."
The army could not march at night, and even if the fourth prince intended to pursue them, setting out at dawn, the first to be encountered would be the mercenaries left behind. He thought, even if this worthless bunch collapses at the first touch, they could still buy him quite a bit of time.

The next day, the Duke did not receive any news of the Prince catching up. To confirm this, he sent out his trusted men to expand the reconnaissance range, and the reports were the same. This made him slightly relieved; probably that new type of weapon was as difficult to move as a trebuchet and could only be used in defensive battles. Relying solely on a group of miners armed with sticks, the Prince would not dare to act rashly.

By three in the afternoon, the Duke ordered the knights to halt their advance and wait for the infantry following behind to catch up. By dusk, the mercenaries and freemen had gradually caught up with the cavalry. Everyone was busy again, hastily setting up tents on a cleared piece of land.

As long as he got through this night, by tomorrow he would be able to reach the Longsong Stronghold—with its thirty-foot-tall bluestone walls, it was like a natural moat for a force of several hundred men. Even if the other side possessed long-range new weapons, he could use the trebuchets behind the wall to counterattack. This account, he would definitely settle with the Prince.

However, what made Duke Ryan uncomfortable was the feeling of being watched all the way today.

It was probably an illusion, he thought. He was just too nervous.

The next morning, the Duke was awakened by the sound of cannon fire.

When he rushed out of his tent, he saw everyone running around in panic, with soil and blood splattering from time to time. Looking to the west, the "militia" wearing standard leather armor stood in a straight line, quietly outside the camp. Amidst the deafening roar, the Duke had only one thought in his head—how did they catch up?

Why didn't the knights who were responsible for scouting yesterday discover any pursuers?

"Duke, hurry!" A bodyguard brought a horse over and shouted loudly.

Osmond Ryan finally snapped out of his trance. He flipped onto his horse and, along with his personal guards, galloped eastward in a frenzy. However, not long after they left the camp, they encountered another identical troops.
They wore the same standard leather armor and held strange short sticks in their hands, lined up in neat rows, with expressions that seemed all too similar.
Then, the Duke heard rhythmic music coming from the opposite side. His Highness's troops marched towards him with uniform steps.
