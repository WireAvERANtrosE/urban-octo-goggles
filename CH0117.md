## Pursuit (Part 1)
Carter Lannis witnessed such a battle for the first time.

The massive formation of over three hundred knights had not even touched the edge of the defensive line before they were routed.

Until the end, they were unable to enter the fifty-meter range—that was the firing line drawn by His Highness for the gun squad, and only when the enemy crossed the fifty-meter line were all allowed to fire.

Four cannons firmly contained the opponents near the hundred-meter line. In the area between one hundred fifty and one hundred meters, about twenty bodies lay haphazardly; like himself, these men were all skilled knights, otherwise, they would not have been able to control their horses and advance at high speed amidst the roaring cannon fire.

Carter was relieved that he was not one of them. He had a vague premonition that future wars would be vastly different, and with Roland Wimbledon possessing such a formidable force, it was only a matter of time before he would claim the throne.

A few soldiers from the First Army showed adverse reactions like dizziness and vomiting after witnessing the gruesome battlefield, but because it was not close-quarters combat, the shock of killing enemies with cannons was less than the sensation of killing enemies with blades, and the symptoms were not severe. Carter selected a group of hunters from the team who were accustomed to seeing severed limbs and blood to retrieve the bodies of the fallen, while also searching for survivors.

As the sun gradually sank behind the mountains, Carter looked at the blood-red sky and the cawing of crows rising from the distant woods, and he suddenly felt a sense of desolation.

The era of the knights had ended.

...



the Duke of Lion still hadn't been able to snap back to reality.

He couldn't understand how he had been defeated when the defensive line seemed as thin as a cicada's wing, ready to be pierced through with a light poke, yet his knights fled in all directions as if they had seen the devil. He couldn't even blame anyone else, for the ones leading the charge were the elite knights under his command.

The personal guards had to cut down several men to prevent the swarming mercenaries from reaching the Duke's position, but that was all they could do. No matter how he roared, he couldn't regroup his defeated subordinates. Left with no choice, Duke Osmond Ryan had to retreat with the flow of people, and this retreat spanned nearly ten miles.

Only when night fell did the Duke choose a place near the riverbank to set up camp. The scattered knights and mercenaries started to gather around the torches, but many were still unaccounted for. What was worse, during the retreat, the freemen didn't hesitate to abandon the carts and food supplies, so tonight they had to slaughter a few horses to serve as military provisions.

Inside the largest tent in the camp, the nobles of the five major families huddled together, their faces pale as they looked towards the Duke of Lion, whose complexion was no better.

"Can anyone tell me what new weapon they used? It has a longer range than a crossbow, and we can't see any stones being thrown like from a catapult," he glanced at Rene Mead, "You were also at the front, did you see anything?"

"My lord, I... I'm not sure," Rene supported his head, "I just heard the roaring sound continuously, and then they fell down in batches, especially the last blast, the knight at the forefront seemed to suddenly hit an invisible wall. I saw his body shake, and his head and arms exploded into pieces, just like..." he thought for a moment, "an egg dropped from the top of a castle."

"Could it be a witch?" murmured the Earl of Elk.

"Impossible," the Duke frowned, "My knights all wear God's Punishment Stones; witches can't possibly harm them. Haven't you played with witches before? What difference is there between them and ordinary women when faced with the God's Stone?"



"Right, my lord," Rene suddenly recalled, "Before hearing the loud noise, I saw several carts in their formation, like pushcarts, mounted with huge iron pipes, from which red light and smoke could emerge."

"Iron pipes? Red light and smoke? Isn't that just a firework?" Count Elk was puzzled.

The duke, of course, knew what fireworks were. In the past, only the nobles in the capital would use them during major celebrations, but now, lords everywhere would have one or two on hand. There was a pair of bronze fireworks in his castle, which would burst with a bang when filled with snow powder. But that sound paled in comparison to the thunderous roar that captured the heart today.



"Fireworks wouldn't tear knights to pieces," Count Honeysuckle spoke up, "No matter what weapon the prince used, we have already been defeated. What should we do next?"

the Duke of Lion glanced at him with displeasure, the word 'defeat' was especially grating to his ears, "We have not been defeated," he stressed, "A setback in a battle cannot change the final outcome. As long as we return to the stronghold, I can call up another troop, and at the same time, cut off the trade on the Redwater River. Without food supplies, Border Town won't last a month. If he dares to bring those peasants out, my knights can crush him from the flank and the rear."



Victory will eventually be his, he thought, but the losses incurred were not something a small town could compensate for... The chance of taking over the North had almost vanished. Damn it! If he could capture Roland Wimbledon, he would have to tear him to pieces.

"But my lord, the fleet on the Redwater River comes not only from Longsong Stronghold, but also from Willow Town, Dragon Cliffs City, and Redwater City. If we intercept them all, won't it..." Count Honeysuckle hesitated.

"I'll just buy them all," the duke said coldly, "As long as I pay, it doesn't matter who they sell to. Everyone go back to your tents and sleep, we leave at dawn. The knights with horses will move with us, those without will stay behind to lead the mercenaries."



Marching at night was impossible, even if the Fourth Prince intended to pursue them, setting off at dawn, the first thing he would encounter was the mercenaries left behind. He thought, even if this rabble crumbled at the first blow, they would still buy him plenty of time.



The next day, the Duke did not receive any news of the prince catching up to them. To confirm this information, he sent out his trusted confidants to expand the scope of the reconnaissance, and the reports they brought back were the same. This allowed him to breathe a sigh of relief; it seemed that the new type of weapon was as difficult to move as a trebuchet and could only be used in defensive battles. With only a group of miners armed with wooden sticks, the prince would not dare to act rashly.



By three in the afternoon, the Duke ordered the knights to halt their advance and wait for the foot soldiers behind them to catch up. As dusk approached, the mercenaries and free folk finally caught up with the cavalry one after another. Everyone was busy once again, hastily setting up tents on a patch of grass.



As long as he could get through this night, tomorrow he would be able to reach Longsong Stronghold—with its thirty-foot-tall bluestone walls, it was like a moat to an army of a few hundred men. Even if the enemy possessed long-range new weapons, he would be able to counterattack with the trebuchets behind the walls. He would definitely settle this account with the prince.



However, something that made the Duke of Lion slightly uncomfortable was that all day long, he felt as if he was being watched.



It was probably an illusion, he thought, he was just too tense.



The next morning, the Duke was awakened by the sound of cannon fire.



When he rushed out of the tent, he found everyone running around in panic, with soil and blood splashing intermittently. Looking to the west, he saw "militiamen" dressed in standard leather armor standing in a straight line, quietly outside the camp. Amidst the deafening roar, the only thought left in the Duke's mind was—how did they catch up?



Why hadn’t the knights responsible for scouting discovered the pursuers yesterday!?



"Duke, hurry up!" A bodyguard brought over a horse and shouted loudly.



Osmond Ryan finally snapped out of his daze. He flipped onto his horse and followed his personal guards as they dashed eastward. However, not long after they left the camp, they encountered another force identical to their own.



They wore the same standard-issue leather armor and held strange short sticks in their hands, arrayed in neat rows, even their expressions seemed eerily similar.



Following that, the Duke heard rhythmic music coming from the opposite side. Prince His Highness's troops, marching in orderly steps, advanced towards him.
