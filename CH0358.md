## Invitation
This is not mere speculation; the history of human civilization serves as excellent proof. From the Stone Age to the Iron Age, it took humanity nearly a million years, but the transition from the Iron Age to the Steam Age rapidly shortened to 3,200 years. Then, it took only 150 years to move from the Steam Age to the Electrical Age, and just another fifty years to welcome the Information Age.



From the news revealed by Agatha, it is known that the demons are not an unchanging race. Over eight hundred years ago, their combat methods were similar to humans, engaging in close combat with shields and swords forged from bronze and wrought iron, and to counter witches, some high-ranking demons would even wear the Divine Stone of Judgement. In siege warfare, facing long-range weapons such as bows, crossbows, and catapults on the walls, the demons basically had no effective countermeasures and often had to suffer heavy casualties to capture a fortress. If not for their natural brute strength, humans might have been the ultimate victors in the First Battle of Divine Will.



However, by the Second Battle of Divine Will, the enemy had already developed magic stones that could be mass-produced, and the race had diversified. Different forms of demons were assigned different combat tasks, and even the numerous Mad Demons possessed long-range attack methods. According to Agatha, they even created transportation tools and engineering equipment driven by magic stones! Now, more than four hundred years have passed, what have they evolved into?



Roland originally thought that Agatha could bring him the magic stone technology of the Taki Association, thereby opening a new path for industrial development, but he did not expect that such technology would actually come from the enemy. In this way, the competition with the demons could likely evolve into a war of industrial technology versus magic stone technology.



Whoever develops faster will win the final victory.



Thinking of this, Roland couldn't help but sigh. It seemed necessary to have a good talk with Tilly.



...



After dinner, Roland waited in his office for Tilly Wimbledon.



Seeing that she had come alone, he felt quite relieved—at least in terms of trust, there had been considerable progress between the two territories.

"I heard from Nightingale that you wanted to discuss something with me," she said straightforwardly as she sat down.

"Yes," Roland personally poured a cup of tea and handed it to her, "it's mainly about how to deal with the third Battle of Divine Will and our future."

Tilly took the cup, blinked, and seemed to wait for him to continue.

"From Agatha's words, we can know that the Four Kingdoms are just a corner of the Dawn Realm, and even the Barbarian Land was once a flourishing fertile plain. Humanity has been defeated by demons twice and had to retreat to this place. According to the timing of the stone gate's opening, the third Battle of Divine Will is not far from us." Roland hesitated for a moment, then said directly, "I hope you can stay."

Tilly was slightly startled and then couldn't help but chuckle, "I didn't expect you to say that."

"The strength of the demons is unpredictable. We must gather all the forces we can to have a chance of winning the war. Although Agatha said that the first Battle of Divine Will was fought with the cooperation of mortals and witches, it was likely just a superficial collaboration, not fundamentally different from the second Battle of Divine Will," he said earnestly. "You've seen it, the memories that have appeared in my mind hold the weapons that can defeat the demons, and once the things in there are turned into reality, even ordinary people can unleash unimaginable power. Witches are responsible for operating the war machines, and it should be the right choice for ordinary people to join the war. As the great war approaches, every additional person is an extra strength."

"..." Tilly sipped her tea and did not reply for a long time, which made Roland's heart hang in suspense.

But there was no use in being anxious at such times, so he maintained a calm appearance on the surface and quietly waited for her to speak.



Almost half an hour later, Tilly finally sighed and broke the silence, "What about the witches of Sleeping Island if I stay?"



Does this mean... she agreed? Roland suppressed his excitement and said, "Let them all come to Border Town. This place can fully accommodate them. I will specifically allocate a territory for your witches to live in, and each person's treatment will be consistent with that of the Witch Union—Ah, I'm not trying to incorporate all of them into the Witch Union, they will still be led by you, equivalent to establishing an autonomous region in the Western Region. This not only facilitates cooperation but also enhances our mutual understanding."



"Treatment is all the same?" She couldn't help but chuckle, "You really don't mind their abilities. You know that most of them can't fight for you."



"No, no," Roland waved his hands repeatedly, "In the cooperative model I envision, support witches can play a greater role than combat witches because what they enhance is not themselves, but tens of thousands of ordinary people—Nature does not lack strength, only those who discover and utilize it. In this regard, the abilities of support witches are far superior."



"So, this is your real purpose?" She asked slyly.



"Uh—"



"Indeed, the conditions are generous," Tilly chuckled and shook her head, "Publicly, I cannot refuse to join you in fighting against the devil's invasion. Privately, I also wish to stay here and learn those interesting pieces of knowledge... But I cannot agree to you now."



Roland was taken aback and asked subconsciously, "Why?"



"Since I am the leader elected by the witches of Sleeping Island, I cannot decide their future based on my personal preferences. Once we move to the Western Region, the organization will inevitably lose its independence. If something unexpected happens then, they will also be powerless to resist. If one day we have a conflict, can all the witches pack up and return to Sleeping Island again?"



"No, how could I possibly—"

"I can't pin their futures on verbal assurances," Tilly interrupted, "If you were me, would you simply hand over everything you have to someone else because of an alliance?"

Roland was momentarily stumped, the answer nearly required no thought; if he faced such a choice, he would definitely not agree easily to others. More often than not, the closer you get, the easier it is for conflicts to arise, hence the saying 'distant friendships, close attacks'. It's like this between powers, and even so in the dealings between lovers.

"See, your concerns are the same as mine."

"But... you're my sister, I would never harm you," Roland could only try one last effort.

"Is that so... but I find it hard to believe those reasons you've given," Tilly said with a touch of sadness as she closed her eyes, "Perhaps that's also why I can't immediately agree to your request." She paused, seemingly trying to cast away these thoughts, "For now, let's interact as allies—I will fully support the construction of Border Town, and if there are any witches you need, I will try to meet your requests first... If it really becomes impossible to withstand the devil's assault, you can still return to Sleeping Island and live out your life in peace. That's all I can offer for now."
