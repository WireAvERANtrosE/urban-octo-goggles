## I'm sorry, but without the specific Mandarin text excerpt from the novel "Release That Witch" by Er Mu, I can't provide you with a translation. If you provide the text, I would be happy to assist with the translation.
After dinner, Candle had gone early into the castle hall.

Whenever night fell, Teacher Scroll would hold classes in the hall. Unlike the noble academies in the big cities, the students here were all witches from the Witch Union.

But she was not the first to arrive at the "classroom"; Evelyn was already sitting beside the long table and waved at her.

"Has Prince Roland recently assigned you any tasks?" Candle had barely sat down when Evelyn eagerly asked.

Candle remembered that when she first arrived, she used to formally address him as My Lord. She secretly chuckled inwardly, "Yes, he asked me to use my ability on some weird-shaped metal bumps to make them solidify at room temperature, though I'm not sure what use that serves."

"Is... is that so," her eyes dimmed slightly, "His Highness has not asked me to do anything so far."

"Hasn't even the practice content been specified?" Candle asked in surprise.

"No, I've just been practicing on my own," Evelyn shook her head, "He only occasionally has me taste new blends of white spirits."

"Perhaps what His Highness values is just that. You've worked in a tavern before and are very familiar with the taste of various kinds of alcohol. Witches like that are not common."



"Tasting wine doesn't necessarily require a witch," she protested. "A salary of one Gold Royal is enough to recruit a specialized winemaker."

"Uh..." Candle said, patting the other's shoulder, "I think His Highness must have his plans."

"Scroll comforted me in the same way, but even I don't know what this ability can do. I can't turn water into wine out of thin air... Is it to blend the best-tasting wine for sale? But the commoners can only afford poor quality barley beer, and the nobles have different tastes." Evelyn rested her chin on the table, discouraged, "Moreover, the wine His Highness brews is getting... harder to drink. I suggested to him to dilute it with water or juice, but he seems to only want to make the strongest liquor possible."

Candle didn't know what to say for a moment; in this respect, she and Evelyn could be considered to share the same plight. After going to Sleeping Island, most of their time could only be spent doing miscellaneous chores—as the fish oil resources became increasingly abundant, solidified candles became nonessential, and drinking was an activity expressly forbidden by Lady Tilly.

And during the earlier days of hardship, supplies were often distributed based on abilities, and sometimes Candle only received a single unsalted grilled fish for the whole day. She didn't think there was anything wrong with this practice and was willing to give more food to witches who consumed a lot of magic power, but the divisions and the subtle sense of exclusion that arose among the witches made her feel somewhat uncomfortable. Fortunately, Lady Tilly took great care of them and even apologized for this method of distribution, promising to adjust it once supplies were more plentiful, preventing the witches from showing their exclusion too obviously.

But in Border Town, such situations hardly ever occurred—the witches all sat at the same table, sharing meals with His Highness the Prince, and there was no difference in what they wore or used... Most importantly, regardless of whether their abilities were strong or not, they all saw each other as a whole, which was evident from their daily interactions. Although she had only been in Border Town for a short two weeks, she had already deeply felt this.

They truly regarded each other as sisters.

This made Candle feel very envious.

After all the witches had gradually taken their seats, Teacher Scroll came in holding a stack of white paper, "We're not learning new content today. I will conduct a comprehensive test on everyone's learned knowledge."



"What is that?" Lightning was the first to raise her hand.

"Hoot?" Maggie followed closely behind.

"You have been studying for three months now, and His Highness believes it is necessary to test your learning outcomes," Scroll said with a smile. "All the questions are listed on these papers, divided into the Kingdom's language, mathematics, and nature, a total of sixty questions. Answer correctly and you will gain points, answer incorrectly and you will lose points... Of course, if you can't understand the questions, you are not allowed to raise your hand to ask. I believe you have already mastered the basics of reading and writing; otherwise, you wouldn't be able to answer even if you knew the responses." She paused for a moment. "By the way, His Highness mentioned that only those who answer more than half of the questions correctly will be able to enjoy the ice cream dessert on Saturday afternoon. Those who score below this threshold will have their afternoon tea privileges revoked."

Candle heard a snap behind her and turned to see Nightingale with a stunned expression, her charcoal pencil broken in two on the floor.

"Additionally, His Highness has specifically stated that the five witches from Sleeping Island are not included in this, so you can choose to stay and answer the questions with everyone else or take a day off," Scroll looked towards Candle and Evelyn and the others. "Regardless of the final score you receive, you can still enjoy the delicious afternoon tea."

"Phew," Evelyn patted her chest and whispered, "I can't even recognize all the characters; I thought for sure I wouldn't get any ice cream."

Honey and Lily happily stood up, bowed to Scroll, and then left the hall.

With her body feeling slightly under the weather and with Sylvie already absent, only she and Evelyn remained of the Sleeping Island witches.

"Are you going to stay?" Candle asked in a low voice.



"I want to give it a try," the other party nodded, "Didn't Prince Roland say that knowledge could evolve abilities? If I don't put more effort into this, I'm afraid I'll never catch up with them." She revealed a cunning smile, "These days I've been practicing writing in my room after class, and Lily and Miya have also been teaching me how to read and write some common words."

Mentioning this, the frustration in her tone dissipated quite a bit, and her eyes began to sparkle, which made Candlelight involuntarily curl her lips upward.

"Really? Then I might as well give it a try too."

...

"Your Highness, the results of the test are out," Scroll handed the summary sheet to Roland.

"Thank you for your hard work," the recent discovery in the North Slope Mine had left him utterly baffled, making it hard to concentrate on his daily work, so he decided to shift his attention to something lighter, "Huh, Nightingale actually passed?"

"Yes, and her score was among the top, with a perfect score in the Kingdom's language," Scroll said with a smile, "After all, most of the questions you set were quite simple, and she already knew how to read and write, which naturally gives her a significant advantage over witches who are starting from scratch."

"Ts ts," Roland clicked his tongue, "I thought this exam might make her cut down on sweets." Before he finished speaking, he felt a sharp pinch on his shoulder. "Anyway, the results look quite good this time, all members of the Witch Union scored above sixty, it seems your education has been very effective."

"That's also inseparable from their hard work."



Roland shifted his gaze downward, "Only two witches from Sleeping Island participated in the test?"



"Yes, Evelyn scored five points, and Candle scored thirty-six points. The latter must have some foundation, with most of her points coming from the Kingdom Language section," she replied.



To be able to score points outside of the literacy test after only two weeks of classes shows that the individual quality of witches is indeed astonishing, worthy of the continuous improvement by magic both internally and externally. His own witches were just as outstanding; people like Lily, Hummingbird, and Miya went from illiterate to a basic mastery of reading and writing in just three months, a feat that surpasses most ordinary people.



If everyone could completely set aside their prejudices and work together with the witches to promote the development of society and civilization, what kind of future would that be? Roland was filled with expectation.
