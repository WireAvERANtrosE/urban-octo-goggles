## Examination
After dinner, Candle moved early into the castle hall.

Every nightfall, Teacher Scroll would start a lecture in the hall, unlike the noble academies in the big cities, the students here were all witches from the Witch Union.

But she was not the first to arrive in the "classroom"; Evelyn was already sitting by the long table and waved at her.

"Has Prince Roland recently assigned you any tasks?" Candle had just sat down when Evelyn asked impatiently.

Candle remembered how dryly she used to address him as Lord when she first arrived. She secretly chuckled in her heart, "Yes, he asked me to use my power on some weirdly shaped metal lumps, to solidify them at room temperature. I have no idea what they're for."

"Is... is that so," her eyes dimmed, "His Highness has yet to ask me to do anything."

"Hasn't he specified what you should practice?" Candle asked curiously.

"No, I've been practicing on my own," Evelyn shook her head, "He only occasionally asks me to taste new blends of spirits."

"Maybe that's exactly what His Highness values about you. You've worked in a tavern before and are very familiar with the taste of various alcohols. Such a witch is not common."



"But you don't need a witch to taste wine," she protested. "A salary of one gold royal is enough to recruit a specialized winemaker."



"Uh..." Candlelight patted the other's shoulder, "I think His Highness must have his plans."



"Scrolls also comforted me, but even I don't know what this ability can do, and I can't turn water into wine out of thin air... Is it to blend the best tasting wine for sale? But the commoners can only afford poor quality barley beer, and the nobles all have different tastes." Evelyn rested her chin on the table, feeling dejected. "Moreover, the wine His Highness makes is getting... harder to drink. I suggested he dilute it with water or juice, but he seems to want to make the strongest liquor possible."



Candlelight didn't know what to say for a moment, as on this point, she and Evelyn could be considered to suffer from the same plight. After heading to Sleeping Island, most of their time was spent on trivial chores—as fish oil resources became more abundant, the need for solid candles diminished, and drinking was a behavior expressly forbidden by Lady Tilly.



When life was tense in the early days, resources were often distributed based on abilities, and sometimes Candlelight only got one unsalted grilled fish a day. She didn't see anything wrong with this practice and was willing to give more food to witches who consumed a lot of magic power, but the resulting cliques among the witches and the subtle sense of exclusion made her uncomfortable. Fortunately, Lady Tilly took great care of them, apologized for this method of distribution, and promised to adjust it once resources were plentiful, which prevented the witches from showing too much obvious discrimination.



But in Border Town, such situations hardly ever occurred—the witches all sat at the same table and enjoyed meals with the prince. There was no difference in what they wore or used... Most importantly, regardless of whether their abilities were strong or not, they all saw each other as one whole, which was evident in their daily interactions. Although she had only been in Border Town for a short two weeks, she had already deeply felt this.



They truly regarded each other as sisters.



This made Candlelight very envious.



After all the witches had taken their seats one by one, Teacher Scroll came in with a stack of white paper, "Today, we won't learn new content, I will conduct a comprehensive test on everyone's knowledge."



"What is that?" Lightning was the first to raise her hand.

"Gugu?" Maggie followed suit.

"You have been studying for three months now, and His Highness thinks it is necessary to test your learning outcomes," Scroll said with a smile. "All the questions are listed on these papers, divided into Kingdom Language, Mathematics, and Nature, with a total of sixty questions. Correct answers will earn points, while wrong ones will deduct points... Of course, if you can't understand the question, you are not allowed to raise your hand to ask. I believe you have already mastered the basics of reading and writing; otherwise, even if you know the answer, you won't be able to respond." She paused for a moment, "By the way, His Highness said that only those who answer more than half of the questions correctly will be able to enjoy the ice cream dessert on Saturday afternoon. Anyone scoring below this limit will have their afternoon tea privilege revoked."



Candle heard a snap behind her and turned around to see Nightingale with a stunned expression, her charcoal pencil broken into two pieces on the ground.



"Additionally, His Highness specifically mentioned that the five witches from Sleeping Island are not included in this, so you can choose to stay and take the test with everyone else or have a day off," Scroll looked towards Candle and Evelyn and the others. "No matter what scores you get, you can still enjoy the delicious afternoon tea."



"Phew," Evelyn patted her chest and whispered, "I can't even recognize all the characters, I thought for sure I'd miss out on the ice cream."



Honey and Lily were very happy; they stood up, curtsied to Scroll, and left the hall.



With her body feeling a bit unwell, and Sylvie, who had not come in the first place, only she and Evelyn were left from the Sleeping Island witches.



"Are you staying?" Candle asked in a low voice.



"I want to try," the other nodded, "Prince Roland once said that knowledge could evolve one's abilities, right? If I don't put in the effort in this area, I'm afraid I'll never catch up with them." She revealed a sly smile, "These days, I've been practicing writing in my room after class, and Lily and Miya have also been teaching me how to read and write some common words."

As she mentioned this, the dejection in her voice dissipated quite a bit, and her eyes began to sparkle, which made the candlelight involuntarily curl up the corners of her mouth.

"Really, then I'll give it a try as well."

...

"Your Highness, the test results are out," Scroll handed the summary table to Roland.

"Thank you for your hard work," the recent discovery in the northern slope mine had puzzled him, and he couldn't concentrate on his daily work, so he decided to shift his attention to something lighter, "Eh, Nightingale actually passed?"

"Yes, and she even scored among the top ranks. She got a perfect score in the Kingdom Language section," Scroll said with a smile, "After all, the questions you set were mostly very simple, and she already knew how to read and write, which naturally gave her quite an advantage over the witches who had to start from scratch."

"Tsk tsk," Roland smacked his lips, "I thought this exam might make her cut down on sweets." No sooner had he spoken than he felt a sharp pinch on his shoulder. "Anyway, the results look pretty good this time, all members of the Witch Union scored above sixty. It seems that your education has been very effective."

"It's also inseparable from their hard work."



Roland shifted his gaze downward, "Only two witches from Sleeping Island participated in the test?"



"Yes, Evelyn scored five points, while Candle got thirty-six. The latter must have some foundation; most of her points came from the Kingdom Language section," she answered.



Having attended classes for only two weeks and already being able to score points beyond the written assessment, witches truly had remarkable individual qualities. They were indeed constantly improved by magic, both internally and externally. His own witches were equally exceptional; individuals like Lily, Hummingbird, and Miya went from being completely illiterate to basic literacy within three months, a feat that surpassed most ordinary people.



If everyone could put aside their prejudices and work together with the witches to drive the development of society and civilization, what kind of future would that be? Roland was filled with anticipation.
