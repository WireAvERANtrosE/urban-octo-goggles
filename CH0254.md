## Alliance
The weather in the fjords was very peculiar; yesterday was a clear, cloudless day, and today it turned gloomy with wind and thunder, a sign that a storm was imminent.



Ashes pressed down her windblown hair as she entered Tilly's residence, and the first thing she saw was the giant pigeon squatting on her shoulder.



"Maggie?"



"Coo!" The pigeon lifted its head, its eyes brightened, and it flapped its wings, diving towards the door. Ashes easily caught it and said, "Turn into a human first, then talk."



"Ooh... coo," Maggie fluttered to the ground, shedding her feathers to reveal her true form, and with a pout said, "Do you dislike pigeons?"



"It just feels odd for a big pigeon to talk," Ashes smiled as she helped the girl up from the ground, "When did you get back?"



"Just a short while ago. I was afraid I'd get caught in the storm; I almost broke my wings flying," she patted her chest, "Luckily, I reached Sleeping Island before the rain started."



"Did you... fly back like this?" Ashes held her forehead, "Why didn't you transform into a tern? Isn't that much faster?"



"Ah..." Maggie blinked in sudden realization, "I forgot, coo."



Tilly couldn't help but laugh, putting down the letter in her hand, "Thank you for your hard work. I'm already aware of the news from there. You can go and play with Lian and Molly for a while. Let me know when I've figured out how to reply."



"Okay, coo!" Maggie saluted and then hopped out of the room.



"What did Roland Wimbledon say?" Once the room was left with only the two of them, Ashes walked over to Tilly and sat down on the floor beside her. In front of her was a map spread out, which upon closer inspection, appeared to be the topography near Border Town.



"This is his letter," Tilly handed her a piece of paper, "I have to say, the witches he's chosen are really... unique."



Ashes quickly read through the letter and couldn't help but frown, "He actually chose Sylvie? Does he not care about being exposed at all?"



"I don't know," Tilly responded noncommittally, "Perhaps my description of my abilities was too vague, so he didn't delve into it? Or maybe he doesn't mind revealing his identity in front of us, to show the sincerity of cooperation? Of course, there's another possibility..."



"He really is your brother," Ashes added, "so he doesn't care about Sylvie's abilities at all."



"However, that possibility is slim," she said with self-deprecating laughter, "Who knows better than I what kind of person my brother is? If it were really Roland Wimbledon, he would never choose to be enemies with the Church just to protect witches. From a young age, what he was best at was avoiding—whether facing challenges or difficulties... Even when he was dispatched to the remote region by the Order of Inheritance, he never once protested to 'Father,' not even symbolically."



Ashes raised an eyebrow, "Anyway, him actively choosing Sylvie is good for us. It means we don't need to find an excuse to send out an extra witch. But what about the other witches... are you really going to agree to his terms?"



"Why not?"



"Lotus is one of the most important witches on Sleeping Island, who will repair the mud houses if she is gone? If we want to build something or alter the terrain of the island, it's extremely inconvenient without the ability to reshape the land. After all, we have utilized less than a third of the entire Sleeping Island; there are many places that can be transformed," she counted on her fingers, "Honey is also important, she can command the ospreys to catch fish for everyone, and all the delicious fish soup that everyone enjoys every day is thanks to her. As for Candle and Evelyn, there aren't too many problems... Can't you reject his request and send two witches who aren't as useful instead?"



"What is useful and what is not? I am sending them to Border Town hoping to form an alliance with them, not to abandon them," Tilly's expression grew serious, "No matter what their abilities are, the sisters who chose to come to this isolated island are all witches. How can we build Sleeping Island into a homeland for witches if we select them based on the usefulness of their abilities?"



Ashes had seen such an expression on her face in the court before—this was the expression of Princess Tilly when she was truly angry, and she involuntarily changed her address, "I'm sorry... Your Highness, I just—"



Tilly sighed and said slowly, "Moreover, the abilities of everyone are difficult to measure by any standard. Roland has selected these five from over a hundred witches, which includes Candle and Evelyn whom you mentioned as not very useful. Are they really of no use? Perhaps through this contact, we can understand whether his selection of these two was by chance, or if he saw something we have not realized." She paused, "Regardless, we are already a very small group, and every witch is worth fighting for. They are not tools for building our homeland, but partners with a common goal. Don't say such things again in the future."



"Yes, Your Highness," Ashes bowed her head.



Just then, a bolt of lightning tore through the clouds, striking the sea directly. Like a divine command, the deafening thunder followed immediately after, exploding over Sleeping Island, and rain fell from the sky. It started with a sparse pitter-patter, then quickly merged into a continuous roar. The dense curtain of rain made the scenery outside the window blur with a layer of white mist, the intensity of the rain even for a moment overshadowed the conversation between the two.



Ashes stood up to close the window, preventing the rain from drifting indoors. Turning back, she saw Tilly swaying slightly, her expression seemingly a bit haggard.



"Did you stay up late again last night?"



"Mm," Tilly yawned, "all the books brought back from the ruins are written in the same script, and I've already found their commonalities. Given some time, I'm sure I can translate them all."

"Yes, given time... We're free from the Church's entanglement now, there's plenty of it. You really don't need to stay up all night studying them," Ashes frowned, "it's bad for your health."

"Don't worry, I'm an Extraordinary Witch, my body isn't that frail." The fifth princess took a deep breath, "Besides, I have a vague sense of foreboding—the scenes I saw in the ruins are unsettling. It's better to decipher the contents of these books sooner... By the way, when the witches head to Border Town this time, have them take an ancient tome with them."

"If even you can't understand it, the witches from the Witch Union are even less likely to."

"It's just a shot in the dark," Tilly said, "I've heard that there's also an ancient relic in the Eastern Region Forest, and the Witch Union's origin is right in Fjords, almost adjacent to the forest. Maybe some of them have seen this script before. If we can prove that the scripts from both places are the same, it would mean that these ruins were all made by the same group of people."

"Yes, I understand," Ashes replied.

"Also, I wasn't blaming you before, you made some valid points—just not the part about the significance of abilities," she raised her hand to stop Ashes from speaking, "I've made an agreement with the Crescent Moon Bay Chamber of Commerce; they will relocate a portion of the common people to Sleeping Island next spring. It would indeed affect the island's subsequent construction if Lily is away for too long, so before the winter comes, I will have them return to the Fjord."

Ashes breathed a sigh of relief, "That's good to hear."

"However, to avoid any misunderstandings, I will also lead a few combat witches to take their place and go to Border Town to help the Witch Union resist the Evil Months," Tilly revealed a sly smile, "Would you like to join me then?"



Ashes hesitated for a moment before finally replying helplessly, "Of course, Your Highness."
