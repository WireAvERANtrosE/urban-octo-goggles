## Alliance
The weather in the fjords was quite peculiar. Yesterday it was a clear sky without a cloud in sight, but today it was overcast, with the wind howling and thunder rolling, signaling the imminent arrival of a storm.



Ashes held down her windswept hair as she entered Tilly's residence, and the first thing she saw was the giant pigeon squatting on her shoulder.



"Maggie?"



"Coo!" The pigeon lifted its head, its eyes brightening. It spread its wings and flew straight towards the doorway, but Ashes easily intercepted it with her hand. "Turn into your human form before you speak."



"Ooh... coo," Maggie flapped down to the ground, shedding her feathers to reveal her true form. With a pout, she said, "Do you dislike pigeons?"



"It just feels weird to have a big pigeon talking," Ashes said with a smile, helping the girl up from the ground. "When did you get back?"



"Just a moment ago. I was afraid I'd get caught in the storm. I almost flew my wings off," she patted her chest, "fortunately, I made it to Sleeping Island before the rain started."



"Is this how you flew back?" Ashes held her forehead. "Why didn't you change into the form of a seagull? Isn't that much faster?"



"Ah..." Maggie blinked as if she just realized, "I forgot, coo."



Tilly couldn't help but laugh out loud, she put down the letter in her hand, "You've worked hard, I'm already aware of the news from there. You can go play with Lian and Molly for a while. Let me know when I have thought of a reply."



"Okay, coo!" Maggie saluted and then hopped out.



"What did Roland Wimbledon say?" Once only the two of them were left in the room, Ashes walked over to Tilly's side and sat down on the ground. A map was spread out in front of her, and after a careful glance, it seemed to be a topographic map of the area near Border Town.



"This is his letter," Tilly handed her a piece of paper, "I have to say, the witches he's chosen are... quite unique."



Ashes quickly finished reading the letter and couldn't help frowning, "He actually chose Sylvie? Does he not care at all about being exposed?"



"I don't know," Tilly said noncommittally, "Perhaps my description of my abilities was too vague, causing him to not delve too deeply? Or maybe he doesn't mind revealing his identity in front of us, to show his sincerity in cooperation? Of course, there’s also another possibility..."



"That he really is your brother," Ashes continued, "so he doesn't care at all about Sylvie's abilities."



"However, that possibility is minuscule," she said with a self-deprecating laugh, "Who knows what kind of person my brother is better than I do? If it really is Roland Wimbledon, he definitely would not choose to oppose the church to protect witches. From a young age, what he was best at was avoidance, whether in the face of challenges or difficulties... Even when he was ordered to the frontier by the royal decree, he never once voiced an objection to 'Father,' not even a symbolic one."



Ashes raised an eyebrow, "In any case, his proactive choice of Sylvie is good for us. This way, we don't have to find an excuse to send out another witch. But what about the other witches... are you really going to agree to his terms?"



"Why not?"



"Lily is one of the most important witches on Sleeping Island. If she is gone, who will repair the mud houses when they are damaged? If we need to build something or transform the terrain of the island, it's extremely inconvenient without the ability to reshape the land. After all, we have utilized less than one third of Sleeping Island's area; there is still plenty of space to transform," she counted with her fingers, "Honey is the same; she can command the ospreys to fish for everyone, and all the delicious fish soup that everyone enjoys every day is thanks to her. As for Candle and Evelyn, there aren't too many problems... Can't you refuse his request and send two witches who aren't as useful instead?"



"What is useful, what is not? I'm sending them to Border Town in hopes of forming an alliance with the other party, not to abandon them," Tilly's expression turned serious, "No matter their abilities, all the sisters who chose to come to this isolated island are witches. If we want to build Sleeping Island into a homeland for witches, how can we select them based on how much or little their abilities are used?"



Ashes had seen such an expression on her face in the court before—this was the look of the fifth princess when she was truly angry. She involuntarily changed her way of addressing her, "I'm sorry... Your Highness, I was just—"



Tilly sighed and slowly said, "Moreover, the abilities of everyone are hard to measure by any standard. Roland selected these five out of more than a hundred witches, including Candle and Evelyn whom you mentioned as not very useful. Are they really of no use? Perhaps through this contact, we will be able to understand whether his choice of these two was by chance, or if he saw something we did not realize." She paused, "Regardless, we are already a very small minority. Every witch is a target worth striving for; they are not tools for building a home, but partners with a common goal. Do not say such things again in the future."



"Yes, Your Highness," Ashes bowed her head.



Just then, a bolt of lightning cut through the clouds and struck the sea. Like a divine command, the deafening thunder followed immediately after, exploding above Sleeping Island, and rain began to fall from the sky. It started as a sparse pitter-patter, but soon swelled into a continuous roar. The dense curtain of rain made the view outside the window blur into a layer of white mist, and the intensity of the rain even momentarily drowned out the sound of their conversation.



Ashes stood up to close the window, preventing the rain from drifting inside. Turning back, she saw Tilly shake slightly, looking somewhat exhausted.



"Did you stay up late again last night?"



"Uh-huh," Tilly yawned, "The books brought back from the ruins are all written in the same language, and I've found a common thread among them. Given time, I'm certain I can translate them all."

"Indeed, given time... We have rid ourselves of the Church's entanglement, and there's plenty of time. You really don't need to stay up all night studying them," Ashes frowned, "It's taking a toll on your health."

"Don't worry, I am an Extraordinary Witch, my body isn't that easy to break down." The Fifth Princess took a deep breath, "Besides, I have this ominous premonition—the scenes I saw in the ruins unsettle me. It's better to decipher the content of these books sooner rather than later... By the way, when the witches go to Border Town next time, have them bring along an ancient book."

"If even you can't understand it, the witches from the Union are even less likely."

"It's just trying our luck," Tilly said, "I've heard that there's also an ancient ruin in the Eastern Region's forest, and the Union's origin happens to be in Fjords County, practically adjacent to the forest. Perhaps someone among them has seen this script before. If we can prove that the scripts from both locations are the same, it means that these ruins were all made by the same group of people."

"Yes, I understand," Ashes replied.

"Also, I wasn't blaming you earlier; you did make some valid points—not the part about the size of abilities' impact," she raised her hand to stop Ashes from speaking, "I've reached an agreement with Crescent Moon Bay Chamber of Commerce. They will relocate a portion of the ordinary people to Sleeping Island next spring. If Scroll is away for too long, it indeed would affect the island's subsequent development, so before the onset of winter, I will have them return to the Fjords."

Ashes sighed in relief, "That's good to hear."

"However, to avoid any misunderstandings, I will also lead a few battle-type witches to replace them and head to Border Town to help the Union resist the Evil Months," Tilly revealed a sly smile, "Would you be willing to go with me then?"



Ashes was stunned for a moment, but ultimately could only answer helplessly, "Of course, Your Highness."
