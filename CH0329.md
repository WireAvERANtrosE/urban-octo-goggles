## Horn
After finishing this topic, Roland cleared his throat and switched to a serious tone, "Next is the news about the devils and the relic."

He informed Tilly of the recent discoveries made in the snow-capped mountains behind Border Town and the Misty Forest. "I originally planned to send witches and the First Army soldiers to bring back those trapped in the relic to the town, but this early snowfall, over a month ahead of schedule, has disrupted all the plans."



"The legendary devil army is so close at hand, and there are still people in the relics from more than four hundred years ago..." Tilly was so surprised that she was speechless, "I'm starting to believe what you told me..."



Anna turned her head to look at Roland, who coughed twice, "Based on the scenes observed on the spot and the reaction of the other party, the devils that are entrenched behind the snowy mountains must have been there for many years. I suspect that they are limited by the range of the Red Mist and cannot continue to expand into the kingdom's mainland, so they pose no immediate threat to Border Town. I plan to establish coastal watch points in the next two years to monitor their movements." He paused for a moment, "As for the sealer in the relic, she might very well hold the truth behind the fall of the Holy City of Taquila and the Church."



"I think so too," Tilly closed her eyes and pondered for a while, "Is there a way to go directly through the air instead of by land? Ashes said you have a vehicle that can carry people once it's filled with hot air."



"Do you want to bring her out of the relic on the day of Evil Months?" Roland frowned, "The Lookout hot air balloon can carry ten people, or be made a bit larger to fit fifteen, but either way, it's impossible to bring along the First Army soldiers. If we encounter devils, the witches might suffer casualties, not to mention the ubiquitous demonic beasts... It's too dangerous."



"If we rely solely on the Witch Cooperation Association, it is indeed very dangerous," Tilly nodded, "But now with Sylvie and Ashes, the risk has been reduced a lot. According to what you said before, the devils' main methods of attack are long-distance spear throwing and close combat with far more strength than ordinary people. On this point, Sylvie's invisible barrier can block several spear throws, and Ashes can suppress the enemy in close combat. The Evil Months have just begun, and the demonic beasts are not that powerful yet, so if we go to the relic now, it's the best time."



Roland felt hesitant; the last time they fought the devils, they suffered due to the disadvantages in aerial combat. The thought of flying over there again made him feel uneasy. However, Tilly's words also made sense. Sylvie's Magic Eyes could ensure early detection of the enemy, and as long as the hot air balloon maintained a height of ten to fifteen meters, which is just above the treetops, they could be confident of landing before the enemy got close. Then, with the powerful attack capabilities of Nightingale and Ashes, a small group of about ten devils could be easily crushed. And even if there were any that slipped through, the double shield of Sylvie and Anna would ensure the safety of the team.



He pondered for a moment, "Are you really sure you want to go?"



"I think this might be an opportunity to unravel the mystery," Tilly said frankly, "the Evil Months arriving early this year, and the emergence of demonic beasts from the Southern Sea always gives me a bad feeling."

Roland's heart shivered slightly; he shared the feeling. The Evil Months were unlikely to be a freak astronomical phenomenon caused by climate change; he faintly felt that this had something to do with the devils and the Church.

"What about the team?"

"I'm not sure about the witches in Border Town, but I will go there myself," Tilly said without hesitation.

...

Grey skies swirled with snowflakes as Mayne and Tefren slowly ascended the Hermes city walls that had just witnessed a fierce battle.

Beneath their feet flowed black and warm blood, melting the pristine snow into sticky blood water; fortunately, it all came from their enemies. Hundreds of God's Punishment Army soldiers stood upright on the city walls, waiting for the next wave of demonic beasts to attack.

"Your Excellency, the Bishop!" The warriors of the Judgement Army assisting the God's Punishment Army saluted with clenched fists, most of them with somewhat youthful faces, their eyes filled with a mix of fear and excitement.

"They are still children," Tefren walked to an open space, looking out towards the wasteland, and sighed, "When I was their age, I was still grinding flour for the nobles in the mill."



"The God's Punishment Army must prioritize the defense of the New Holy City. I can only leave the remnants still stubbornly resisting in Wolfheart City to the experienced Judgement Army to clear out, and those people are newly promoted believers who have not truly been on the battlefield before," Mayne said helplessly, "This snow has come too early."



Tavlin hesitated, "The Holy Book does not record such a situation."



"The Holy Book is also written by the Pope, and omissions are inevitable," the bishop leaned on the cold battlements, overlooking the cliff below piled with corpses. Ordinary evil beasts could not climb such high walls. The only threats to the Holy City were all hybrid demonic beasts, "As long as the general direction it points out is correct. From the appearance of the desolate beasts last year, we can deduce that we have about ten years left."



"Use two years to unify the Four Kingdoms, then spend eight years accumulating the God's Punishment Army. By then, the Church will be able to have a formidable force of over ten thousand," he continued, "Using the sturdy walls and terrain of Hermes, we will hold out on this plateau until the balance of power reverses with the enemy."



"I am old, and I'm afraid I won't see that time."



"Age is irrelevant, Lord Tavlin," Mayne consoled, "Too many people will not be able to see that moment, just like Allen, Ston, and Litch..."



"And Hester," Tavlin added.



"Yes, and Hester." He nodded, "But regardless, there will be those who come after us to inherit our mission and continue on."



"Let's not talk of such dispiriting matters," the old man shook his head with a smile, "By the way, how effective is the snow powder formula that Jeryl obtained? Has the Secret Area conducted tests?"



"Tools against mortals are of little help to the Church," Mayne said disdainfully. "Snow Powder might be used to clear out packs of demonic beasts, but our true enemy is still the abyssal demons. Its lethality greatly diminishes in open areas, and to make it powerful enough to damage demons clad in heavy armor, the size must be made very large. Apart from the God's Punishment Army, no one can throw a package of Snow Powder the size of half a body."



"Is that so... what a pity."



"To defeat the demons, there's no possibility of taking shortcuts," Mayne said, word by word. "Only by defeating them head-on can we survive."



Just then, a long horn sounded from the watchtower on the side of the wall.



"Wuuu—"



A long blast, signaling the approach of demonic beasts.



"Let's go back to the cathedral, there's going to be another battle here."



"Alright." Tefren nodded, and just as he turned around, the horn sounded again.



"Wuuu—Wuuu—"



Two long horn blasts signified that the demonic beast horde included a large number of mixed demonic beasts. Maine's heart trembled. Without a doubt, the God's Punishment Army was about to face a grueling battle.

But... why so soon? It was only the first month of the Evil Months.

However, before the echo of the horns had faded, a third blast sounded, a dull and prolonged note like rolling thunder passing overhead Helms, refusing to subside for a long time.

"Wuu— Wuu— Wuu—"

Maine could hardly believe his ears. He turned to look at Tavren, who also wore a shocked expression. Three horn blasts represented an extremely urgent situation; the New Holy City was in imminent danger! Even when the demonic beasts had previously broken through the perimeter of the Great Cathedral, such a horn call had never been sounded.

What exactly had the lookout seen?

Maine soon saw the answer for himself.

Among the demonic beast horde that surged like a black tide, there were two monstrously large creatures. They had four thick tusks, four legs and two arms, and were covered in pitch-black fur. A single foot of theirs was as thick as the torso of a wolf-shaped mixed kind. From a distance, the giants seemed like moving fortresses, each step leaving deep imprints in the permafrost-covered plains. The demonic beasts that followed, if they did not avoid in time, would also be crushed underfoot into the ground, turning into a pile of bloody mire.

It was recorded in the holy scriptures under various names: Bringer of Death, Hell Fear Beast, Devil Tusker... But what filled Maine with fear was not its terrifying appearance, but the implication it represented.



Why? His heart was completely seized by a terrifying thought: why had the horrifying monsters, which the Holy Book prophesied would appear only five years before the disaster, now shown up in Hermes?
