## Mentor and Disciple
Kyle Sichi walked through the town, heading towards the Redwater River.



The Border Town of today had become a bustling place, making it hard to imagine that it was once just an outpost set up for scouting demonic beast movements. Underfoot was a hard, dark gray ground, flanked by rows of neatly arranged bungalows on both sides of the street. Unlike residential buildings, these houses were not for living in. They were much more spacious, somewhat resembling smaller warehouses.



According to His Highness, these houses would all be for sale in the future.



In front of the bungalows was a deep drainage ditch covered with stone slabs, like two boundary lines drawn on the black streets. Besides that, at intervals along the road, a large tree would be planted between two bungalows, their branches leaning towards the center of the road, not only providing shade and shelter from the rain but also pleasing to the eye.



It had to be said that the greatest impression this place gave him was its orderliness.



Whether it was the houses, roads, or ditches and trees, all were situated in well-planned positions, with an attention to detail comparable to the gardens of nobility. Strolling through Border Town felt no different from the lord's district in Redwater City—although the latter's architectural scale was denser and more massive, the extremely harmonious arrangement made these ordinary houses exude a unique charm. This feeling overshadowed the individual structures' size and showed a higher level of grandeur as a whole.



It was like those neatly arranged chemical formulas, he thought; this is the beauty that order brings.



Nowadays, Kyle had quite a reputation in the town, with passersby nodding and saluting him, respectfully addressing him as "Mister Sage." However, he preferred the title of "Master Alchemist" over Sage. It was a pity that Prince Roland said one must comprehend "Intermediate Chemistry" before earning this honor.



Leaving the central area, he could see the Redwater River that spanned the Western Territory. The number of laboratories by the river had increased to four, however, the latter two were temporarily idle due to a lack of sufficient personnel.



Kyle was just about to call over a few apprentices to complete the task assigned by His Highness when a soldier in the uniform of the First Army approached.



"Lord Steuer, a sailboat has arrived at the dock area, carrying more than fifty... civilians," he reported after saluting, "Due to the large number and the fact that they didn't seem like merchants, the defense team stopped them. One of them claimed to see you, saying he is an alchemist from the city of Redwater, named—"



"Chambers!" Kyle exclaimed excitedly, grabbing the soldier's shoulder. "Quickly, take me to him!"



...



Dragging the soldier to the dock area, a familiar figure came into view—it was indeed Chambers.



"Master!" The other party also noticed Kyle immediately and waved both hands at him.



"These are the alchemists and alchemical apprentices I invited," he said to the captain of the guard, "Let them in, I will take them to the city hall for registration."



"Yes, my lord. But please allow me to dispatch a squad to escort them."



"That's fine."



While it is called an escort, in reality, it is surveillance and control to prevent anyone from leaving the team and blending into the central area of the town. However, these are rules set by His Highness the Prince, and Kyle had no intention of interfering.



"Sir Tutor, what exactly is going on? Why does such a remote small town even have people specifically guarding the dock?" Chames, who had been allowed to pass, quickly walked up to him, complaining with some displeasure, "And they scrutinize more thoroughly than the city guards in big cities, asking for names and origins. Even Silver royals couldn't change their minds."



"Silver royals?" Kyle asked with interest, "How many?"



"Of course, just one," Chames replied, slightly taken aback.



"Hahaha," he laughed heartily, stroking his beard, "Of course that wouldn't work. You should know that their salary is around fifteen Silver royals each month."



"Fifteen Silver royals?"



"Yes, compared with those city patrol teams that can only make a living by extorting merchants and travelers, the First Army lives much more comfortably. However, precisely because of this, extortion, plundering, or accepting bribes are strictly prohibited. Once discovered, they are immediately expelled from the army and thrown into the dungeon for trial." Although Kyle was not a formal official of the City Hall, after attending several meetings as the acting Minister of Chemical Industry, he had a certain understanding of these upper-level policies.



"Can they really control their own hands?" Chames asked with some skepticism.



"There are those who can't control themselves, but they have all been sent to the mines," he said with a sneer. "Didn't you notice the unique aspects of this town when you came?"



"Uh... there are quite a few," the young alchemist scratched his head, "For example, along the river, there seem to be many people cutting trees and building roads. They've already gone so far from Border Town, where exactly do they plan to build to? And what are these iron towers by the riverbank for? Are they for storing drinking water?" He paused for a moment, "Right! Before I arrived at the dock... I even saw an iron bridge under construction! It's not made of wood or stone, I'm sure it was iron!"



"And it's much longer than any bridge you've seen before, isn't it?" the Chief Alchemist smiled slightly, "So don't bring your life experiences from Redwater City here. This is a completely different city. Of course... it's still just a town now, but it's enough to be surprising. It's like the content in 'Elementary Chemistry', before you see it with your own eyes, you would never imagine that such 'possibilities' exist in the world."



For some reason, as he said these words to his former apprentice, he felt an inexplicable sense of refreshment and pleasure. After thinking about it, he realized that he had already considered himself a member of Border Town, taking joy in showing off his new home to a guest.



...

After completing the registration, the apprentices were arranged accommodations by the officials of the City Hall, while Kyle Sichi directly took Chames back to his own residence.



"Although I knew you would accept my invitation eventually, I didn't expect you to come so soon."



"I..." Chames lowered his head somewhat embarrassedly, "I should have accepted your offer earlier."



The Chief Alchemist smiled. He was engrossed in alchemy, but not ignorant of worldly affairs. Chames' initial decision not to leave was likely due to his expectations of the lord, hoping to become the chief by the two-acid process. It wasn't until Kabala became the new chief, who also held considerable prejudice against him, that he made up his mind to leave Redwater City.



However, Kyle didn't mind this little scheming. Aspiring to the position of workshop chief is the ultimate pursuit of every alchemist.



"Don't dwell on the past; alchemy means nothing here, nor does the glory of an alchemist. Here, there is only one thing worth pursuing: chemistry."

"I understand," Chemis took a deep breath.

"Although you'll certainly get your own residence, stay here tonight, just like old times... We haven't had a proper talk in a long time."

When he was teaching Chemis alchemical skills, he would pull the young disciple into all-night discussions, and when they were tired, they would sleep side by side in the same bed, feet touching.

The other party obviously understood his meaning and replied excitedly, "Yes, Teacher!"

After dinner, the two went to the study, where Kyle Sichi carefully brought out the book "Elementary Chemistry."

"Is this the ancient tome you hold in such high esteem?"

Chemis solemnly turned to the first page and began to read intently. Meanwhile, Kyle stood by his side, explaining anything he didn't understand. The scene was reminiscent of years ago when the other person once again became his disciple.

Now with Chemis and the fifty-odd new apprentices, he had enough manpower to experiment with the large-scale production of sulfuric acid, while the other two chemical laboratories could also be put into operation. Kyle thought proudly to himself that most importantly, His Highness would fulfill his promise and hand over "Intermediate Chemistry" to him.
