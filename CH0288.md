## Mentor and Disciple
Kamol Squirrel made his way through the town, heading towards the Redwater River.



The present-day Border Town was now a bustling place, hardly imaginable as the former outpost established for scouting demonic beast movements. Beneath his feet lay the black-grey hard ground, and on either side of the street were neatly arranged bungalows, which were much more spacious than the residential buildings of the district and were not for living in. They were more like slightly smaller warehouses.



According to His Highness, these houses would all be for sale in the future.



In front of the bungalows was a deep drainage ditch covered with stone slabs, carving out two boundary lines on the black street. In addition, at intervals along the road, a large tree would be planted between two bungalows, their branches leaning towards the center of the road, not only providing shade and shelter from the rain but also pleasing to the eye.



It had to be said that the greatest impression this place made on him was its orderliness.



Whether it was the houses, roads, ditches, or trees, all were situated in planned positions, with a degree of meticulousness not inferior to that of a noble's garden. Strolling through Border Town felt no less than in the main district of Redwater City—although the latter's architectural scale was denser and more massive, the extremely harmonious arrangement bestowed these otherwise ordinary houses with a unique beauty. This feeling surpassed the grandeur of individual structures, displaying a higher level of magnificence as a whole.



It was like the neat and uniform chemical formulas, he thought; this was the beauty brought by order.



Nowadays, Kamol had quite a reputation in the town, with passersby nodding and bowing to him, respectfully addressing him as Sage. However, he preferred the title of Master Chemist, but alas, Prince Roland had said that he must grasp "Intermediate Chemistry" before he could earn this honor.



Exiting the central area, one could see the Redwater River that spanned the western border, and the number of laboratories by the river had increased to four. However, due to the lack of sufficient manpower, the last two remained idle for the time being.



Karl was just about to call over a few apprentices to complete the task assigned by His Highness when a soldier dressed in the uniform of the First Army approached.



"Sir Scroll, a sailboat has arrived at the dock area carrying over fifty... civilians," he reported after saluting, "Due to the large number, and because they do not appear to be merchants, the garrison stopped them. One of them says he wants to meet you, claiming to be an alchemist from the city of Redwater, named—"



"Chamis!" Karl exclaimed excitedly, grabbing the soldier's shoulder, "Quickly, take me to him!"



...



Dragging the soldier to the dock area, a familiar figure came into view—it was indeed Chamis.



"Master!" The other party also spotted Karl right away and immediately began waving his hands at him.



"These are the alchemists and alchemy apprentices I've invited," he said to the garrison captain, "Let them all in, I'll take them to the City Hall to register."



"Yes, Sir. However, please allow me to dispatch a squad to escort them."



"That's fine."



While it is called an escort, it is actually surveillance and control to prevent anyone from leaving the group and blending into the central district of the town. However, these are the rules set by His Highness the Prince, and Kymo had no intention of interfering.



"Master, what is going on with them? Why is there someone specifically guarding the docks even in a remote little town?" Chames, who had been let through, quickly walked up to him, complaining somewhat displeased, "And they check more thoroughly than the city guards of big cities, even asking for names and origins. My Silver royals didn't change their minds at all."



"Silver royals?" Kymo asked with interest, "How many?"



"Of course, just one." Chames was slightly taken aback.



"Hahaha," he laughed heartily, stroking his beard, "Of course, that won't work. You should know that their salary is around fifteen Silver royals each month."



"Fifteen... fifteen Silver royals?"



"Yes, compared to those city patrols who can only survive by extorting merchants and travelers, the First Army lives much more comfortably. However, because of this, extortion, looting, or accepting private bribes are severely forbidden. Once discovered, they will be immediately dismissed from the army and sent to the dungeon for trial." Although Kymo was not a formal official of the City Hall, after attending a few meetings as the acting Minister of Chemical Industry, he had some understanding of these higher-level policies.



"You mean they can really control themselves?" Chames asked with a hint of skepticism.



"There are those who can't, but they've all been sent to the mines." He curled his lip, "Didn't you notice the unique aspects of this little town when you arrived?"



"Uh... There are quite a few," the young alchemist scratched his head, "For example, along the river, it seems that many people are cutting trees and building roads, they've already gone so far from Border Town, where exactly do they plan to build to? And what are these iron towers by the riverbank for? To store drinking water?" He paused, "Right! Before arriving at the dock... I actually saw an iron bridge under construction! It's not made of wood or stone, I'm sure it was made of iron!"



"And much longer than any bridge you've seen before, right?" the Chief Alchemist said with a slight smile, "So don't bring your life experiences from Redwater City here, this is a completely different city, well... right now it's still just a town, but it's enough to be astonishing. Just like the content in 'Elementary Chemistry,' you wouldn't imagine that such 'possibilities' exist in the world before seeing them with your own eyes."



For some reason, while saying these words to his former apprentice, he felt an inexplicable sense of exhilaration and pleasure. Upon reflection, he realized that he had come to see himself as a member of Border Town, as if he were showing off his new home to a guest, taking joy in it.



...



After completing the registration, the apprentices were arranged accommodation by the officials at the city hall, while Kyle Sichi directly took Chames back to his own residence.



"Although I knew you would eventually accept my invitation, I didn't expect you to come so quickly."



"I..." Chames lowered his head somewhat embarrassingly, "I should have accepted your offer earlier."



The Chief Alchemist smiled. He was immersed in alchemy, but he was not ignorant of worldly affairs. Chames' initial decision not to leave was likely due to his expectations of the lord, hoping to obtain the position of chief through the two-acid method. It was only after Kabala became the new chief, who still harbored considerable prejudice against him, that he made the firm decision to leave Redwater City.



However, Kyle did not care about these little schemes. Aspiring to the position of workshop chief was the ultimate pursuit of every alchemist.



"Don't dwell on the past matters. Alchemy has no significance here, and the glory of an alchemist is equally worthless. Here, there is only one thing worth pursuing: chemistry."

"I understand," Chavez took a deep breath.

"Although you'll definitely have your own residence, stay here tonight, just like before... It's been a long time since we've had a proper talk."

He used to stay up all night discussing alchemy techniques with Chavez, his young disciple. When they were tired, they would squeeze into one bed and sleep, foot to foot.

The other party obviously understood his intention, responding excitedly, "Yes, Teacher!"

After dinner, the two went to the study, where Kajen Moore solemnly brought out the book "Elementary Chemistry."

"Is this the ancient tome you hold in such high esteem?"

Chavez solemnly turned to the first page and began to read intently. Kajen stood by, ready to explain anything he didn't understand. It was as if they had returned to the days of years past when Chavez once again became his disciple.

Now with Chavez and the arrival of over fifty new apprentices, he had enough hands to test the large-scale production of sulfuric acid, and the other two chemistry labs could also start operating. Kajen thought proudly to himself that the most important thing was that His Highness should now fulfill his promise to hand over "Intermediate Chemistry" to him.
