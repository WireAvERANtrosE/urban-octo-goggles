## Holy See of the Secret Archive
"Hahaha..." Hesha laughed out loud, "It's hardly possible to expect the chess pieces to act completely obediently, as long as they align with our ultimate goal. It doesn't matter where he attacks, as long as the warriors keep depleting. After all, Greycastle is the last kingdom in the plan to attack; there's still time for them to slaughter each other. Didn't Roland Wimbledon reject our pills last time? Perhaps we can have Timothy put more pressure on the Western Region, and maybe then he will accept."



That said, Queen Clearwater's blatant betrayal still displeased Maine, as this chess piece was personally chosen by him. If Timothy, after taking over other territories of Greycastle, still does not engage in a decisive battle with Grace but instead garrisons troops to maintain a standoff, the King's Command won't achieve the expected effect. It seems necessary to take some other measures.



"Let's wait for the news from the envoy group from the Western Region before making a decision," he declared with a finality, "That's it for today, both of you please proceed with the plan, I still need to visit the Hermes Agency."



"Ah, right," Hesha suddenly remembered, "Today is the Transcendence Day, isn't it? How many people have applied to participate in the Transcendence Ceremony?"



"That is a secret of the agency." Maine stood up and walked out of the chamber without looking back.



...



After descending a lengthy suspended staircase to the bottom of the cave, the archbishop stepped over the smooth white grindstone, which was as reflective as a mirror, and walked towards the depths of the agency.



Unlike the usual quietness, the agency was quite lively today, with a group of adjudicators who had passed the review standing outside, waiting. Most of them were entering this place for the first time and were curiously looking around. Upon seeing Maine, they all straightened their chests and saluted with clenched fists, "Your Grace!"



He nodded with a smile in return. These adjudicators were the elite warriors of the church, devoted to the deity and willing to sacrifice—Transcendence, the transformation into God's Punishment Army, was not a guaranteed successful ceremony. They understood this before submitting their applications. Even so, they were still willing to offer their lives for this great honor.



Under the admiring gazes of the warriors, he passed through the third checkpoint and arrived in front of the Arcane Area. The Pope's guards were already waiting there. They bowed, then pushed open the metal gates behind them.



Main followed the guards into the gate. From here on, this was the heart of the Hermes mechanism, where all the research and inventions of the Church were conducted.



There were no torches in the Arcane Area, and his vision suddenly went dark. After adjusting for a moment, a narrow corridor appeared before him. The walls and ceiling of the corridor were made of iron, and on both sides, luminous stones were inlaid—this peculiar stone was a variant of the Divine Stone of Judgement. After being tainted with the blood of demonic beasts, it emitted a greenish glow.



At the end of the corridor was a cage-like lift. As he stepped into the cage, the guard pulled the lever, and the chains above made a grating sound, particularly ear-piercing in the silent corridor. Accompanied by this sound, the cage slowly sank into the cavity below, and then, Main's surroundings suddenly opened up.



An exceedingly spacious underground space appeared before his eyes.



No matter how many times he saw this astonishing sight, it always made him feel insignificant.



Logically, a cave buried underground should be pitch-dark, where you couldn't see your hand in front of your face, but here, the entire cavern was illuminated by the light emitted by the Divine Stones of Judgement—huge Divine Stones of Judgement rose from the ground like countless prisms, forming clusters of crystal flowers. The smallest prism was as thick as a body, while the largest required more than a dozen people to encircle it. Their heights were uneven, with the tallest nearly reaching the top of the cavern, even higher than the Sky Tower of the Hermes Cathedral.



Their colors also varied. The densest cluster of Divine Stones of Judgement was pale purple, with several clusters around it changing from deep blue to light green, while the smaller ones were white. There were also some newly emerged prismatic bodies from the ground, almost transparent. The purple Divine Stones of Judgement emitted the most noticeable luster, especially that one surpassing the Sky Tower, its brightness comparable to a full moon, allowing one to faintly see the ground without the aid of a torch.



Under the influence of such a vast and dense array of Divine Stones of Judgement, the inside of the mountain belly was an area where magic was ineffective. And the Divine Stones of Judgement sold by the Church were all mined from here.



The cave space was large enough to accommodate five or six Hermes Cathedrals, and indeed, they had constructed a building identical to the great cathedral here, naming it the Secret Sanctum. However, compared to the church atop the mountain, this one appeared much older. From mid-air, Mayne could see a black iron door on the mountain wall behind the sanctum, which was the entrance and exit to the foot of Mount Hermes, connecting to the old Holy City. Thus, in a sense, this ancient building was the true body of the mechanism, existing here long before the new Holy City was established.



It took the lift cage a good half quarter of an hour to reach the ground. Mayne stepped out of the cage, straightened his robe, and followed the envoy to the sanctum.



The Transfiguration Ceremony was held in the first-floor hall.



Upon entering the hall, the bishop felt the surroundings return to brightness—not the cold blue-purple light, but the orange glow emitted by thousands of burning candles. Above was a three-tiered candelabra, and many candlesticks were placed around the hall, flickering like countless twinkling stars. Thanks to the open flame, the chill in the cave was somewhat dispelled.



The man standing between the two transfiguration platforms was the highest leader of the Church, Pope O'Brien. He wore a striking red robe with gold trim and a golden, gem-encrusted crown on his head, carefully checking the transfiguration apparatus, making final preparations for the ceremony.



"Your Holiness," he approached and knelt before O'Brien, kissing his fingers.



"Rise, my child," the Pope's voice was hoarse and slow, "There's no one here but the guards, no need for such elaborate formalities."



"Yes," Mayne stood up, taken aback. His Holiness looked much older than the last time they met, his face full of deep wrinkles, his skin an unhealthy white, flaccid and lusterless, with prominent brown spots standing out starkly. The bishop felt a warmth in his eyes, "You have... worked hard."



"It is the mark of time," O'Brien said calmly, "No one can fight against time. My life is nearing its end, and I'm afraid I won't live to see the day humanity defeats the demons, so I need not endure that unknown pain. But you must continue to fight on, until you ultimately defeat the enemy, or are defeated by them."



And if we fail again, we will be completely annihilated. Mayne nodded, "I will fulfill my duties to the last moment."



"Very good," the old man smiled, "You have done well recently, adding over a thousand more to the Judgement Army for the Church, and this time there are sixty-two applying for conversion, which is the most in years."



"Your Holiness, may I ask, to defeat the devils, how many God's Punishment Army do we actually need?" Mayne hesitated before asking, "All the information I have on the devils comes from the Holy Book. But the records in the Holy Book are incomplete; they lack their origins, their numbers, and their methods of warfare. I know that these secrets are only accessible after one becomes the Pope, but still..."



O'Brien raised his hand to stop him, "You are too anxious, my child. Be patient. It won't be long before you take over the crown and become the next Pope. At that time, all of your questions can be answered in the archive at the top of the Secret Holy Temple. For now, I can only tell you, the more the better." He took a breath, "Besides, even though I didn't call you here for the conversion ceremony, since it came up, you might as well try presiding over this batch of conversions. With me watching, it will also count as accumulating some... cough cough... experience."



Mayne quickly patted the Pope's back, waiting for his breathing to ease, before bowing and saying, "As you command, Your Holiness."
