## Secret Holy Temple
"Hahaha..." Hester laughed out loud, "It's unlikely to expect a pawn to act completely obediently; as long as their ultimate goal aligns with ours, that's enough. No matter where he is fighting, as long as it continues to consume soldiers, that will do. After all, Greycastle is the last kingdom in the plan to be attacked, there's still time for them to slaughter each other. Didn't Roland Wimbledon refuse our pills last time? We can put more pressure on Timothy to deal with the Western Region; maybe then he will accept."



Although she said this, the Queen of Clearwater's blatant betrayal still displeased Maine, as he had personally selected this chess piece. If Timothy, after occupying other territories of Greycastle, still did not engage in battle with Garcia but just stationed his troops in a standoff, the King's Warrant would not achieve the expected effect. It seemed necessary to take some other measures.



"Let's wait for the envoy group's news from the Western Region before making a decision," he decided with a finality, "That will be all for today. Both of you, please proceed with the plan. I still have to make a trip to the Hermes Institution."



"Ah, right," Hester said as if she had just realized something, "Today is the Transcendence Day, isn't it? How many people have applied to participate in the Transcendence Ceremony?"



"That is a secret of the Institution." Maine stood up and walked out of the secret room without looking back.



...



After descending the long, suspended staircase to the bottom of the cave, the Archbishop stepped over the white grindstone as smooth as a mirror and headed deeper into the Institution.



Unlike its usual quietness, the Institution was rather lively today. A group of Judgement Army who had passed the review stood waiting outside the Institution. Most of them were entering this place for the first time and looked around curiously. Seeing Maine, everyone straightened their chests and saluted with a fist, "Archbishop!"



He nodded and returned the smile in greeting. These members of the Judgement Army were the elite warriors of the church, devout to the divine and willing to sacrifice—Transcendence was not a guaranteed successful ceremony, and they understood this before submitting their applications. Even so, they were still willing to offer their lives for this great honor.



Under the reverent gaze of the knights, he passed through the third checkpoint and came before the Secret Area. The Pope's guards were already waiting there. They bowed and saluted, then pushed open the metal gates behind them.



Maine followed the guards inside. From here on, this was the heart of the Hermes mechanism, where all the research and inventions of the Church took place.



There were no torches inside the Secret Area, and his vision suddenly turned dark. After a short moment of adjustment, a narrow corridor appeared before him. The walls and ceiling of the corridor were made of iron, and both sides were embedded with luminous stones—these peculiar stones were a type of God's Punishment Stone, which emitted a turquoise fluorescence after being stained with demonic beast blood.



At the end of the corridor was a hanging cage. As they entered the cage, the guard pulled a lever, and the chains above made a creaking noise, which seemed particularly grating in the silent corridor. Accompanied by the sound, the cage slowly sank into the underground void, and then the view before Maine suddenly opened up.



A vast underground space appeared before his eyes.



No matter how many times he saw this astonishing sight, it always made him feel insignificant.



Logically, a cave buried underground should be pitch dark, where one couldn't see their own hands in front of them, but here, the entire cavern was illuminated by the light emitted from the God's Punishment Stones—a multitude of huge God's Punishment Stones rose from the ground like countless prisms, forming clusters of crystal flowers. The smallest prism was as thick as a body, and the largest almost required more than ten people to embrace it. Their heights varied, with the tallest almost reaching the ceiling of the cave, even higher than the Tower of Heaven in the great Hermes Cathedral.



Their colors also varied. The densest cluster of God's Punishment Stones was light purple, with several clusters ranging from deep blue to light green nearby, while the smaller ones were white. Some prisms had just emerged from the ground and were nearly transparent. The light emitted by the purple God's Punishment Stones was the most conspicuous, especially the one that surpassed the Tower of Heaven, its brightness nearing that of a full moon, allowing one to faintly see the ground below without the need for torches.



Under the influence of such a dense and massive cluster of God's Punishment Stones, the inside of the mountain belly was an area where magic could not take effect. The God's Punishment Stones sold by the Church were also mined from here.



The cave space was large enough to accommodate five or six Hermes Cathedrals, and indeed, they had constructed a building identical to the cathedral here, naming it the Secret Sanctuary. However, compared to the church on the mountaintop, this one looked much more ancient. Maine could see from midair that behind the sanctuary, on the mountain wall, there was a black iron door, which was the entrance and exit to the foot of Mount Hermes, connecting to the Old Holy City. Therefore, in a sense, this ancient building was the true body of the mechanism, existing here long before the New Holy City was established.



It took the cage nearly half an hour to reach the ground, and Maine stepped out of the cage, straightened his robe, and followed the receiving envoy to the sanctuary.



The conversion ceremony was held in the main hall on the first floor.



After entering the hall, the bishop felt that the brightness had returned to the surroundings—not the cold blue-purple light, but the orange glow emitted by the burning of thousands of candles. Above their heads were three-tiered candle chandeliers, and many candlesticks were also placed around the hall, flickering like countless twinkling stars. Thanks to the open flames, the chill in the cave was significantly dispelled.



The man standing between the two conversion platforms was the highest leader of the church, Pope O'Brien. He wore a striking red robe with golden edges and a glittering gemstone crown on his head, carefully inspecting the conversion equipment, making final preparations for the ceremony.



"Your Holiness." He stepped forward and knelt before O'Brien, kissing his fingers.



"Rise, child," the Pope's voice was hoarse and slow, "There is no one else here besides the guards, no need for such tedious formalities."



"Yes," Maine stood up, taken aback to find that His Holiness looked much older than the last time they met, his face covered with deep wrinkles, his skin an unhealthy white, flaccid and dull, with densely packed brown spots that were extremely conspicuous. The bishop's eyes warmed, "You... have worked hard."



"It is the mark of time," O'Brien said calmly, "No one can fight against time. My life is running short, and I'm afraid I won't live to see the day when humanity defeats the devils, so there's no need to endure that unknown pain. But you must continue to fight on, until you ultimately defeat the enemy, or are defeated by them."



Failing once more, we will be completely annihilated, Mayne nodded, "I will fulfill my duties to the last moment."



"Very good," the elder smiled, "You have done quite well recently, adding over a thousand members to the Judgement Army for the Church, and this time, sixty-two have applied for transformation, which is the most in years."



"Your Holiness, could you tell me how many God's Punishment Army soldiers we actually need to defeat the devils?" Mayne hesitated for a moment before asking, "All I know about the devils comes from the Holy Book. But the records in the Holy Book are not complete, lacking their origins, numbers, and combat methods. I know these secrets must wait until one becomes the Pope to be privy to, but..."



Archbishop O'Brien raised his hand to stop him, "You're too anxious, my child. Be patient. It won't be long before you take over this crown and become the next Pope. At that time, all your questions can be found in the archives at the top of the Secret Holy Temple. For now, all I can tell you is, the more the better." He took a breath, "Moreover, although I didn't summon you for the transformation ceremony, since we've met, you might as well try presiding over this session of transformation. With me watching, it can also count as accumulating some... cough cough... experience."



Mayne quickly patted the Pope's back until his breathing eased, then bowed his head and said, "By your command, Your Holiness."
