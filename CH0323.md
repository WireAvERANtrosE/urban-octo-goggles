## Police Force
Speaking of this, Roland also had a rough plan for the future security system of his domain.



The population of the town is currently around 20,000, including the local indigenous people, as well as people from Longsong Stronghold who had been sent here, and refugees from the Eastern Region. When the delegation sent by Barov returns, they might even bring a group of people from the southern and northern parts of the kingdom, further complicating the demographic makeup. The quality of the population will also become more uneven, and conflicts like today's will only become more frequent.



Therefore, he needed to establish a public security system to replace the current patrolling duties of the First Army—separating internal from external violence was a matter of time. He had considered this issue before, but it was shelved due to the shortage of manpower. Now that the First Army needed to focus on fighting the demonic beasts, and with the rapid population growth, it was time to implement the plan.



With laws made, interpreted, and major crimes judged by himself, with only one trial needed; the public security arresting criminals according to the law, and also handling civil disputes. The Security Bureau would be responsible for maintaining the purity of all systems, effectively preventing the corruption of power, and could also utilize public security personnel to carry out sweeping operations, saving on human resources—this was the outline of the security system Roland envisioned.



The ideal scenario would be to first test run this security system in Border Town, and then expand it to the entire Western Region when the city is established next year.



At that time, whether it is an autonomous territory of the nobles or not, the same set of laws would be enforced, under the control of a unified department. The only one who could be above the law would be himself alone.



Roland was clear that as the greatest noble of the Western Region, he could not claim equality before the law for everyone, nor could he abolish the nobility system. But at the very least, he could ensure that there would be no traditional feudal nobles in his city. Those who wanted to seek refuge in the Western Region would have to give up their autonomy.



As for the head of the public security department, Roland had already thought of a good candidate.



The Chief Knight, Carter Lannis, who possessed a sense of justice and was not pedantic in his actions, was a fine choice.



Wade staggered back to his temporary residence when the old man, Kukasim, immediately came forward to greet him.

"Are you... okay?"

"I'm fine," he said with a grin, "just got whipped ten times by His Highness."

"Let me have a look at that," Kukasim said urgently.

"Let's talk inside." Wade entered the house, and the warm air instantly dispelled the chill around him. Closing the door behind him, it felt like he was in a different world. Compared to the previous wooden shack that leaked air and rain from all sides, this slightly cramped and low mud house felt much more comfortable.

Right, the locals seem to call this type of house a cave dwelling, don't they?

The old man had him lie down on the kang bed and pulled up the clothes on his back, involuntarily gasping at the sight.

"Your back is all bloody; I'll go get some ash to sprinkle on it."



"No, absolutely not. This is just blood from the punishment; the bleeding has already stopped," he hastily interjected. "The knight said that it's best to leave it open like this. It only takes two or three days for the wound to heal."



"Two or three days?" Kukasim shook his head worriedly. "No, child, you might get a fever, and your back could swell up terribly. Even if you are strong, it will take at least a week to recover. You should know better than me what it's like when the sickness flares up."



"You might not believe it," he licked his somewhat dry lips, "but I don't feel much pain from the wound on my back. Instead, there's a cool and slightly itchy sensation, which is a sign of healing—after the whipping, they poured a bucket of water over me..."



"Saltwater?" The old man frowned deeply.



"I thought so too, but the scorching pain I anticipated didn't come," Vedd chuckled lowly, "The knight executing the punishment said the water eliminates all disease-causing microbes. To heal the wound faster, one shouldn't do anything extra, just let it air out."



"Disease-causing what?"



"Microbes," he curled his lip, "Who knows what that is, probably something to do with witches again."



The old man bowed his head, and after a long while, he said gravely, "You shouldn't have stood up for me; if you had just endured it..."



"If I had just endured, things would have gotten worse. I know what that guy is like, or rather, most nobles are all the same," Vedd spat out, "I heard it snows here for several months at a stretch, and together, our money won't last until then." He paused, "And... I picked that time to beat him on purpose."



"Intentional? Intentional?" Kukasim was stunned.



"Because at this time every day, His Highness the Prince appears on the west city wall. Since he has promised free distribution of food, he will definitely hate actions that damage his reputation, and this is also the most effective method. If it were just a simple brawl, it might not even reach His Highness's ears. After all, Koya Harvis might be acting on someone else's orders, and the officials at the city hall might want to suppress this news, so whatever we say would be useless."



"But he could also have been instructed by the lord..."



"That's highly unlikely. If His Highness wanted to save that little money, he would just reduce three meals a day to two. Besides, I've already inquired in advance, both the local residents and the serfs have nothing but praise for His Highness's kindness and wisdom." He smiled proudly, "You see, I didn't bet wrong, did I?"



"So that's how it is," the old man breathed a sigh of relief, "You really see things very clearly."



But there were parts that he didn't guess correctly, Wetter thought, and that was the punishment.



As a patrol member who had been serving in Goldoak City for more than ten years, he had a deep understanding of the ugliness beneath the city's glamorous exterior. He had seen more than a dozen nobles who abused their power for extortion and bribery, and such incidents even occurred within the patrol team itself. Therefore, dealing with these high-and-mighty nobles was not difficult for him.



The Prince's reaction was basically as he expected, but the punishment caught Wetter off guard.



In such cases, lords who care about their reputation usually declare the oppressed innocent, but His Highness punished everyone involved—seemingly valuing the system more than his reputation.



For a lord who was used to doing as he pleased, this was indeed a rare quality.

"What do you plan to do next?" the old man asked after a moment of silence.

"Rest for two days—as permitted by the knight, then continue as before, helping those guys with the strange weapons do some odd jobs."

"You could have moved into the inner city area and lived a decent life with the craftsmen."

"But you can't get in, Kukasim, let's not talk about this anymore," he shook his head, "I won't leave you out there."

This old man was neither his family nor his elder. Half a year ago, the other party was still a prisoner locked up in a cell. Everyone knew that the old man was just a scapegoat pushed out by the rats of the underworld, but such things were so common that the patrol team didn't bother to care. Later, when Gold City was raided by a large group of pirates, he was supposed to die in the chaos but was hidden in a cell by the old man at the critical moment, covered with a foul-smelling sheet, and ultimately escaped by luck.

Ved never expected that he would be saved by a prisoner whom he wouldn't normally deign to look at, and he suddenly realized that he was no different from those detestable nobles.

The other two people in the room knew Kukasim's identity; it was alright as long as he was watching over him, but once he was gone, they would certainly trouble the old man.

"Don't worry, everything will get better," Ved patted the other's shoulder.



Two days later, he heard the news from the inner city district that His Highness the Prince was recruiting members for the Public Security Team.
