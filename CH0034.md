## Test Explosion
Before the construction of the cement segment kiln had even begun, Roland had already planned out several follow-up project experiment rooms. Most of them were built around the Northern Slope Mine and could be effectively concentrated for guarding—these flat-roofed buildings with mud-brick walls and wooden ceilings were constructed very quickly and did not affect the progress of the town wall construction.



The saltpeter purchased in large quantities from Willow Town was all transported to a nearby warehouse for storage. When needed, it was ground and weighed by servants in batches and delivered to the flat-roofed buildings. Charcoal and sulfur were handled the same way, with the transportation and mixing of the three raw materials completed by different groups of people, which greatly minimized the risk of leaks.



Roland measured out twenty pounds from the prepared black powder and slowly poured it onto a trimmed sheepskin.



This gunpowder had been treated with soaking, compacting, drying, crushing, and sieving, resulting in uniformly sized grains with excellent combustion properties. To prevent accidental ignitions caused by collision sparks, no metal utensils were used throughout the production process; most were made of ceramic or raw wood.



After pouring the gunpowder, Roland folded the sheepskin in layers, wrapping it up to three layers, then tied it tightly with rope.



"Is this good enough?" asked Carter. Could this thing be called a weapon? Although it was an improved version of snow powder, who could be fooled by just the sound? It might work against farmers who had never been on a battlefield, but any trained soldier or mercenary would not take it seriously. However... the Chief Knight pondered for a moment, considering that the prince's recent activities seemed nonsensical, yet they mostly had astonishing effects. If the demonic beasts had about the same intelligence as wild animals, perhaps this thing could unexpectedly be effective? For instance, a loud blast could scare them off, causing them to scatter and flee, thereby reducing the pressure on the city's defenders.



Roland stuffed the wrapped gunpowder into Carter's arms, then picked up a bag of finely ground gunpowder for ignition. "Almost done, let's go outside the town wall. Iron Axe should already be ready."



About two miles west of the town wall, in a clearing between the Misty Forest and the Impassable Mountain Range, was the area he had designated for this test explosion.



Iron Axe and several other hunters had been waiting there for a long time. Apart from Iron Axe himself, they were all locals and the best archers among them. When they heard that the prince had a task for them, they immediately followed Iron Axe eagerly.



Everyone now knows that the new lord of Border Town is never stingy with the hiring rewards. 

As Roland ordered, they set up long poles around the area, tied ropes to them, and formed a warning circle close to half a mile in circumference. Knights were arranged to patrol near the town wall to prevent anyone from accidentally getting close.

Roland walked around the warning circle to inspect it and nodded, "Have the prey been brought here?"

"Your Highness, they're all here." Iron Axe came forward, dragging a cage, and Carter noticed that it contained several wild chickens and rabbits.

"Good, place them at distances of five steps, ten steps, fifteen steps, and thirty steps from the center point, tying one to each wooden stake."

Carter shook his head secretly and stepped forward to suggest, "Your Highness, I'm afraid the animals you've chosen won't be effective for the test. They are inherently very timid and will scatter at the slightest noise. Even if they can be frightened, that doesn't necessarily mean they will scare away demonic beasts."

"Scare away demonic beasts?" Roland was slightly taken aback, then he realized, "I have no intention of scaring them away, although the explosion is going to be impressive."

He walked to the center of the circle with the Chief Knight, put down the gunpowder bag, and cut a small opening with a dagger, allowing some of the gunpowder to leak out. Then he took out a leather bag filled with gunpowder and started sprinkling it from the opening, sprinkling as he retreated.

Today's windless weather was very suitable for this primitive method of ignition.



Only after retreating nearly a hundred meters did Roland stow away the leather bag.

"Alright, let's start the fire here," he repeatedly estimated the distance, and after confirming there were no mistakes, he said to Carter, "Go call all the hunters over."

At this moment, Roland was also somewhat excited. He had already conducted a small-scale flash combustion test before and was not worried about the results of the experiment. What he cared about was that this would be a grand moment. From today on, firearms would officially take the stage, and he, as the leader, would be written into the milestones of history.

After everyone gathered, Roland ignited the gunpowder.

Carter lay on the ground, looking at the quickly departing sparks, feeling somewhat skeptical.

At such a distance, and not placed inside a bronze barrel, it was questionable whether the sound of the snow powder exploding could reach them. Yet Prince Roland had asked everyone to lie down on the ground. However, since the Fourth Prince had set the example, he felt it inappropriate to say more.

The winter ground was bitterly cold, and even through his chainmail, he could feel the chill creeping up. Carter shifted his body, preparing to turn his chest to the side when suddenly, a thunderous boom erupted—

Due to the close distance, the explosion and the shockwave almost arrived simultaneously; he felt a buzzing in his ears, and the world suddenly fell silent. The trembling of the earth was fleeting, and when he looked up, he saw a cloud of black smoke slowly rising, followed by stones and mud raining down like a downpour.

The impact Roland received was much smaller than that of the Chief Knight. Accustomed to blocking his ears when setting off firecrackers, he had immediately prepared for protection after igniting the gunpowder. Contrary to how it's shown in movies, the explosion did not produce a huge ball of fire. The flash of light was fleeting, a mass of mud was lifted by the blast wave, reaching about ten meters into the air. When the dust settled, Roland's only impression was that the sound was much louder than that of firecrackers.



As for Iron Axe and the other hunters, they were so frightened that they were staring with their mouths agape. Only Iron Axe knew that this trip was to test a new weapon, but he had not expected the weapon's power to be so astonishing.

It could probably only be compared to the thunder of divine punishment!

Roland stood up and led everyone back to the blast site, where a half-meter-deep crater was left on the ground. The rabbit that had been closest to the blast center had vanished without a trace, leaving only a short stump of wood behind.

He checked the other animals one by one. The pheasants placed at ten and fifteen steps lay motionless on the ground, clearly dead despite the absence of visible external wounds. Roland knew they had been killed by the shockwave from the explosion.

The only survivor was a grey rabbit about thirty steps (approximately 15 meters) away. Blood oozed from its thin ear flaps, and it no longer struggled when someone approached, as if the loud noise had stolen its soul.

Carter swallowed his saliva, his ears gradually returning to normal after the buzzing sound, and only then did he understand what His Highness meant by "not intending to scare them away." Was this really an improvement on gunpowder? With this achievement alone, an alchemist could far surpass the astrologers.

Iron Axe looked at Roland with completely changed eyes, "Your Highness, if the militia could have such weapons, Border Town would no longer fear the threat of demonic beasts. Is it possible to produce them in large quantities?"

Roland spread his hands, "Probably not. By the time the Evil Months arrive, we'll likely only have enough for twenty or thirty." The main issue was saltpeter; the methods of producing it in this era were very primitive, relying on mixing lime into human and animal waste to collect the potassium nitrate crystals that formed. Apart from the need for alchemy workshops and the upper nobility, it had almost no other use, so there weren't many such refining sites. If all were used for making explosives, the supply would quickly be exhausted.

As a trump card, this weapon must be used in conjunction with muskets and crossbows.
