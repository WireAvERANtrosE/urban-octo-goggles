## Test Explosion
From the very beginning of the construction of the cement section furnace, Roland had planned for the subsequent experimental rooms, most of which were built around the Northern Slope Mining Area for effective centralization and surveillance— the construction of these single-story houses with mud-brick walls and wooden roofs was extremely fast, and it did not impact the progress of the city wall construction.



The saltpeter purchased in large quantities from Willow Town was all transported to nearby warehouses for storage. It would only be ground and measured by laborers when needed, and then sent to the houses in batches. The same was true for charcoal and sulphur. The transportation and mixing of the three raw materials were completed by different groups of people, which could minimize the risk of leaking secrets to the maximum extent.



Roland measured out twenty pounds from the prepared black powder and slowly poured it onto a cut piece of sheepskin.



These powders had undergone soaking, compacting, drying, crushing, and screening, and were now uniform granules with excellent combustion performance. To prevent accidental sparks from collisions, no metal utensils were used throughout the production process, most of which were ceramic or wooden products.



After pouring out the powder, Roland stacked layers of sheepskin, wrapped it up to three layers, and then tied it tightly with a rope.



"Is this good enough?" Carter asked. Could this thing in front of him be called a weapon? Although it is an improved version of snow powder, who could be scared off by the sound alone? It might work against farmers who have never been on a battlefield, but any trained soldier or mercenary would not take it seriously. However… The chief knight considered carefully, the things His Highness had been doing recently seemed utterly unreasonable, but most of them were surprisingly effective. If you say that the intelligence of demonic beasts is similar to wild beasts, perhaps this thing could be surprisingly effective? For example, a loud roar could scare them into scattering, thus reducing the pressure on the city defense team.



Roland stuffed the wrapped powder into Carter's arms, then picked up a bag of finely ground powder used for ignition. "Pretty much, let's go outside the city wall, Iron Axe should be ready."



About two miles west of the city wall, in a clearing between Mist Forest and Desolate Ridge, was the explosion test area he designated for this time.



Iron Axe and several other hunters had been waiting here for a long time. Except for Iron Axe himself, everyone was a local and among those with the best archery skills. Upon hearing that Prince Roland had a task for them, they immediately followed Iron Axe eagerly.



Now, everyone knew that the new lord of Border Town was never stingy when it came to employment wages.

Following Roland's instructions, they set up long poles around the area, tied ropes to them, and formed a warning circle nearly half a mile in radius. Knights were arranged to patrol near the direction of the city wall to prevent anyone from accidentally approaching.

Roland circled the warning area for inspection, nodded, and asked, "Have the prey been brought?"

"Your Highness, they're all here." Iron Axe came forward dragging a cage, and Carter noticed there were several wild chickens and rabbits inside. 

"Very good. Place them five, ten, fifteen, and thirty steps away from the center, each tied to a wooden stake."

Carter shook his head secretly, stepped forward, and suggested, "Your Highness, I'm afraid these animals you've chosen won't test the effect well. They're incredibly timid and will scatter at the slightest noise. Even if they're frightened, they may not necessarily scare away the demonic beasts."

"Scare away the demonic beasts?" Roland was slightly taken aback, then reacted, "I have no intention of scaring them off, even though the impact of these things exploding is indeed astonishing."

He led the Chief Knight into the center of the circle, put down a bag of gunpowder, cut a small hole with a dagger, and let some of the gunpowder leak out. He then took out a bag filled with gunpowder, began to sprinkle it from the hole, and gradually retreated as he did so.

It was a windless day, very suitable for this primitive way of ignition.



Only after retreating nearly a hundred meters did Roland put away the leather bag.

"Alright, light it up here," he repeatedly estimated the distance, and after confirming it was correct, he said to Carter, "Go and call all the hunters over."

At this moment, Roland was also somewhat excited. He had already conducted smaller-scale flash tests before, and he was not worried about the test results. What he cared about was that this would be a great moment. From today onwards, firearms would officially take the stage, and he would be written into the milestones of history as the leader.

After everyone had gathered, Roland lit the gunpowder.

Carter lay on the ground, watching the quickly receding sparks, feeling somewhat skeptical.

From such a distance, and not placed in a bronze barrel, it was doubtful whether the sound of the snow powder explosion could reach this place, and yet Prince His Highness had everyone lie down on the ground. But since the Fourth Prince had set the example, he couldn't say much more.

The winter ground was full of chill, and he could feel the cold spreading up through his chainmail. Carter shifted his body, preparing to turn his chest to the side, when a thunderous boom suddenly sounded—

Due to the close distance, the explosion sound and shockwave almost arrived simultaneously, and he felt his ears buzzing, and the world suddenly became quiet. The earth's tremor was fleeting, he raised his head, only to see a cloud of black smoke slowly rising, followed by pebbles and mud falling like rain.

The impact on Roland was much less than that on the Chief Knight. He, who would even cover his ears when setting off firecrackers, had made protective preparations immediately after lighting the gunpowder. The explosion point was not like what was portrayed in movies, where a huge ball of fire would rise. The flash of fire was fleeting, and a large amount of mud residue was lifted by the shock wave, rushing into the air about ten meters high. When the dust settled, Roland's only feeling was: this sound was much louder than firecrackers.



As for Iron Axe and the other hunters, they were already dumbfounded with shock. Among them, only Iron Axe knew that the purpose of this trip was to test a new weapon, but he hadn't expected the weapon's momentum to be so astonishing. 

Perhaps only the thunder of divine punishment could compare to it! 

Roland stood up, leading everyone back to the point of the explosion. On the ground was a pit half a meter deep. The rabbit closest to the epicenter of the explosion had already disappeared without a trace, leaving only a short stump on the ground. 

He checked the other animals one by one. The wild chickens placed ten and fifteen steps away lay motionless on the ground, obviously dead. Although there were no visible injuries, Roland knew they had died from the shockwave of the explosion. 

The only survivor was a grey rabbit about thirty steps (approximately 15 meters) away. Fresh blood seeped from its thin ear walls, and it no longer struggled when people approached, as if the loud noise had just taken away its soul. 

Carter swallowed, the buzzing in his ears gradually subsiding. It was only at this moment that he understood what Prince Roland meant by "not planning to scare them away". Is this really an improved version of snow powder? Just based on this achievement, alchemists might far surpass astrologers. 

Iron Axe's look towards Roland had completely changed, "Your Highness, if the militia could have such a weapon, Border Town would no longer fear the threat of evil beasts. I wonder if it can be mass-produced?" 

Roland spread his hands, "Probably not. By the time the Evil Months arrive, we will likely only have enough to make twenty or thirty." The main issue was saltpeter. The methods of making saltpeter in this era were still very primitive, relying on pouring a lime mixture into human and animal dung to collect the crystallized potassium nitrate. Apart from the alchemy workshop and the upper class needing it, there were almost no other uses, so there weren't many such extraction sites. If all were used to make explosives, it would be quickly depleted. 

As a trump card, this weapon must be used in conjunction with firearms and crossbows.
