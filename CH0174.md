## Industrial Park
Two days after Ashes left, Maggie unexpectedly returned to Border Town, reappearing before everyone to their surprise.

After understanding the reasons, her return was warmly welcomed, and the Witch Union gained a new member.

She was particularly touched by the welcome banquet held in the castle's back garden, where long iron racks were hung with various kinds of meat ready to be taken down and barbecued at will. The seasonings were also plentiful, with salt, oil, chili powder, pepper, and a barbecue sauce personally concocted by Roland—made by stewing mushrooms from the Misty Forest and a whole chicken together, then adding salt, sugar, and flour to the mix, compensating for the absence of MSG. Maggie almost burst her stomach before she stopped eating.

In the afternoon, Roland tested her abilities.

According to Nightingale's judgment, her magic power was of a medium level among the witches, and her ability manifested in the transformation into various kinds of birds—provided she had seen them before. The transformation consumed a significant amount of magic power; she could transform 4-5 times in a row per day, while maintaining the transformed state consumed very little magic power, which was a summoning type of ability, influenced by the Divine Stone of Judgement. Her favorite bird to transform into was the pigeon, but Roland noticed that no matter which bird she turned into, she was significantly larger in size. For example, when she turned into a sparrow, it was already the size of an ordinary pigeon. And when she really became a pigeon, it was about the size of a sea eagle.

Maggie also couldn't transform into the mythical flying beasts, such as the phoenix, griffin or kunpeng, which Roland had drawn, much to his disappointment.

Furthermore, one aspect of Ashes' plan that deserved his attention was the abilities possessed by the many witches that Tilly had gathered. If there were any support witches who could significantly enhance farming efficiency, he wouldn't mind exchanging technology for them.

For this reason, Roland decided to write a lengthy letter to Tilly, first expounding on the natural alliance between the two sides, then warning her of the Church's intention to unify the continent, and finally extending an olive branch, expressing his desire for mutual assistance, cooperation, and common progress. He planned to have Maggie take it to the Fjords next month.

The next day, the prince received another piece of good news.



The workshop for the production of steam engines was finally completed. Located on the west end across the Redwater River, right next to Leaf's experimental fields, the entire land was fenced with wood and a simple road leading to the pontoon bridge was leveled. In Roland's plan, this place was to become the industrial park of the town in the future.



The workshop was built with light-weight wood to maximize the building space, covering an area of about 1,000 square meters. The machine tools made by Anna had been transported in, including two steam boring machines, two manual milling machines, one manual grinding machine, and one manual lathe. Although the principles of these machine tools were simple, their craftsmanship was first-class—with the exception of parts like bases or pedals that were made of wood, all other components were cut from wrought iron or steel, achieving the highest precision machining possible with the current level of materials.



Currently, there were only a pitiful dozen workers in the workshop, who were originally blacksmiths and apprentices from the town's smithy. Now, they had been recruited by Roland with a high salary of fifty Silver royals per month to learn how to operate high-end machine tools. Their forging tools and the smithy had also been moved to a brick house outside the workshop. Apart from forging some unimportant parts, the production of the steam engine would be completed entirely by machine tools.



Roland held a ribbon-cutting ceremony at the entrance of the workshop. To magnify the event, he summoned all the officials from the City Hall and delivered a brief speech. Amid the echoes of simulated cannon salutes, the Greycastle Industrial Company was officially announced.



Over the following days, Roland, as the person in charge of the company, took every opportunity to demonstrate the operation of the machine tools and the manufacturing process of the steam engine. To teach the illiterate blacksmiths how to process and assemble a steam engine, the best method he could think of was to create flow diagrams, similar to model assembly instructions, labeling part names, numbers, and sizes, and then depicting the order of installation and connection methods in the form of diagrams. In this regard, Soria was of great help to him.



The production during the initial days was as he had expected: almost no part met the requirements, let alone assembling a complete steam engine. However, Roland didn't care about the scrap rate. In Anna's hands, these defective products could be recast into new plates in the blink of an eye. He believed that with repeated practice, it was only a matter of time before these blacksmiths mastered the production methods of the new era.



Apart from the industrial workshop, the prince had also converted the calcining room in the northern mining area along with the backyard into an armament factory, mainly for the production of revolving rifles and bullets—after the arrival of the "kiln expert" recommended by Karl, Rosia, the temperature of the new batch of kilns equipped with bellows had greatly increased, making it possible to independently produce cement powder, rendering the calcining room unnecessary.



However, due to limitations in technology, the production of revolving firearms and bullets was still completed by Anna. Roland was designing a steam-powered stamping machine for pressing bullets. Although its efficiency was not yet comparable to Anna's cutting and molding, it could at least reduce her workload.



To thank Anna for her hard work over the past half-month, he decided to give her a gift.



"Gift?" Anna set aside the part she had just finished working on, brushed the hair from her forehead and revealed a radiant smile, "Okay."



"Aren't you going to ask what the gift is?" Roland teased her.



"Hmm..." She pondered seriously for a moment, "I like all the gifts you give me."



After more than half a year of recuperation, there was no longer a trace of the shadow of the girl who had first been seen in the dungeon. The once emaciated and weak Anna had transformed into a graceful beauty, her blue eyes full of spirit, and her plain dress looked neat and refreshing. She radiated the vitality of youth.



This was how an eighteen-year-old girl should look.



Seeing the corners of her lips involuntarily rise, Roland's mood also became much more cheerful.



The 'gift' was placed in the castle courtyard, and to give Anna a surprise, it was still covered with a layer of burlap. He had this idea when he was making the Ashbringer. As a prince, the gift should certainly be something special; finished products like jewelry seemed too insincere, so he thought for a long time before coming up with this idea.



Roland lifted the burlap, revealing a wicker basket in front of them. At the top of the basket were many ropes, and the other end of the ropes was attached to a huge piece of canvas.



"What is...this?" Anna walked up and circled around it curiously.

"A hot air balloon." He replied with a smile, "It can take you up into the sky, allowing you to overlook the earth like a bird."

"Fly in the sky?" She turned around, her eyes sparkling with excitement, "Really?"

Soaring through the sky has been a dream of humanity since ancient times, from gliders to hot air balloons, from airships to airplanes. People have made great sacrifices in their explorations and challenges and have never given up on this pursuit. Although witches exist in this world, flying remains a privilege for the few. The view from high above is bound to leave an indelible impression.

"Of course, just by filling this envelope with hot air."

Roland had Nightingale bring Lightning and Maggie as emergency responders, just in case something went wrong. With Lightning and Maggie transformed into a large sea eagle, they could at least ensure their safe landing. As for the other witches, he decided it was better not to call them for now, especially Wendy and Scroll, who would definitely oppose any of his adventurous acts—in their eyes, he absolutely could not afford to make the slightest mistake.
