## Industrial Park
Two days after Ashes left, Maggie unexpectedly returned to Border Town and reappeared before everyone.

After understanding the reasons behind her return, her comeback was warmly welcomed, and the Witch Union gained a new member.

She was deeply moved by the welcome banquet held in the castle's back garden, where a long iron rack was filled with all kinds of meat that could be taken down for barbecuing at will. The seasonings were also very rich, including salt, oil, chili pepper flakes, pepper, and a barbecue sauce personally blended by Roland—made by stewing mushrooms from the Misty Forest and whole chickens, then adding salt, sugar, and wheat flour to make up for the lack of monosodium glutamate. Maggie almost burst her stomach before she stopped eating.

In the afternoon, Roland tested her abilities.

According to Nightingale's judgment, the total amount of her magic power was medium among the witches, and her ability manifested as being able to transform into various birds—provided she had seen them. The transformation consumed a significant amount of magic power, allowing her to change up to 4-5 times a day. The maintenance of the transformed state consumed very little magic power and belonged to the summoning type of abilities, which were affected by God's Punishment Stones. Her favorite type of bird was the pigeon, but Roland noticed that no matter into what kind of bird she transformed, her size would always be much larger. For example, as a sparrow, in his view, she was already comparable in size to an ordinary pigeon. As for truly transforming into a pigeon, she was about the size of a sea eagle.

Maggie also couldn't transform into the mythical flying beasts, such as the phoenix, griffin, or kunpeng that Roland had drawn, which he found quite regrettable.

Additionally, one of Ashes' plans was worth his attention, which was the abilities possessed by the many witches gathered by Tilly. If there were support witches who could greatly enhance the efficiency of farming, he wouldn't mind exchanging technology for them.

For this purpose, Roland decided to write a long letter to Tilly, first expounding on the natural alliance between the two sides, then warning her about the church's intention to unify the continent, and finally extending an olive branch, expressing his wish for mutual assistance, cooperation, and joint progress. He would have Maggie take it with her when she went to the Fjords next month.

The following day, the prince received another piece of good news.



The factory for the production of steam engines was finally completed. The factory was located on the opposite bank of the Redwater River, towards the west end, right next to Leaf's experimental farmland. The entire plot of land had been fenced off with wooden barriers, and a simple road leading to the pontoon bridge had been leveled. In Roland's plan, this area was to be the future industrial park of the town.



Due to the need to expand the building space as much as possible, the factory was constructed from relatively lightweight wood and covered an area of about one thousand square meters. The machine tools manufactured by Anna had been transported in, including two steam boring machines, two manual milling machines, one manual grinding machine, and one manual lathe. Although these machine tools were simple in principle, their workmanship was first-class—aside from parts like the base or pedals being made of wood, all other components were cut from wrought iron or steel, achieving the highest precision in processing with the current level of materials.



At present, the factory only had a pitiful dozen workers, who were originally blacksmiths and apprentices from the town's smithy. They had now been recruited by Roland with a high salary of fifty Silver Royals per month to learn how to operate high-end machine tools. Their blacksmithing tools and the smithy itself had also been moved to a brick house outside the factory. Aside from making some unimportant parts, the production of the steam engine would be entirely completed by machine tools.



Roland held a ribbon-cutting ceremony at the entrance of the factory. To make a grand impression, he brought in a number of officials from the City Hall and delivered a brief speech. Amidst the simulated sounds of cannon fire echoing, the Greycastle Industrial Company was officially announced as established.



In the following days, Roland, as the head of the company, would visit the factory whenever he had time, personally demonstrating the operation of the machine tools and the manufacturing process of the steam engine. To teach illiterate blacksmiths how to process and assemble a steam engine, the best method he could think of was to create flowcharts, similar to model assembly instruction manuals, that clearly labeled the names, numbers, and dimensions of the parts, and then depict the order of installation and the method of connection in a visual format. In this regard, Soraya had been a great help to him.



As he had expected, the production in the initial few days yielded almost no parts that met the requirements, let alone a complete steam engine. However, Roland did not care about the scrap rate; in Anna's hands, these defective products could quickly be recast into new plates. He believed that through repeated practice, it was only a matter of time before these blacksmiths mastered the new era's methods of production.



Apart from the industrial factory, the prince had transformed the calcining room in the Northern Slope Mine area, along with the backyard, into an arms factory, mainly for the production of revolving rifles and bullets—after the arrival of the "furnace expert" recommended by Karl, Lucia, the new batch of kilns equipped with airbags had significantly increased in temperature, making it possible to independently calcine cement powder, rendering the calcining room no longer necessary.



However, due to limitations in technology, the production of revolving firearms and bullets was still completed by Anna. Roland was designing a steam-powered punch press for stamping bullets. Although its efficiency was not yet comparable to Anna's cutting and shaping, at least it could reduce her burden.



To thank Anna for her busy work over the past half-month, he decided to give her a gift.



"Gift?" Anna set down the component she had been trimming and smoothed back the strands of hair that had slipped to her forehead, revealing a radiant smile, "Okay."



"Aren't you going to ask what the gift is?" Roland teased her.



"Um..." She pondered seriously for a moment, "I like all the gifts you give me."



After more than half a year of recuperation, there was no longer any trace of Anna's initial appearance when they first met in the dungeon. The once frail and thin girl now stood gracefully, her blue eyes sparkling with vigor, and she wore a plain dress that looked crisp and neat, emanating the vitality of youth all over her.



This was how an eighteen-year-old girl should look.



Seeing her lips curling up involuntarily, Roland's mood also became much more pleasant.



The 'gift' was placed in the courtyard of the castle, and to give Anna a surprise, it was covered with a layer of burlap—this idea had come to him while he was making the Ashbringer. As a prince, the gift had to be something special, something like jewelry or accessories seemed too insincere, so he had pondered for a long time before coming up with this idea.



Roland uncovered the burlap, revealing a wicker basket in front of the two of them. At the top of the basket were many hemp ropes, and on the other end of the ropes was a huge piece of canvas.



"This is... what?" Anna stepped forward and walked around it, curious.

"A hot air balloon," he replied with a smile, "it can take you up into the sky, to overlook the earth like a bird."

"Fly to the sky?" She turned back, her eyes sparkling with excitement, "Really?"

Soaring through the sky has been a dream of humanity since ancient times, from hang gliders to hot air balloons, from airships to airplanes, people have made enormous sacrifices in their explorations and challenges, and they have never given up on this pursuit. Although witches exist in this world, flying remains a privilege for the few. The view from high above must certainly leave a deep impression.

"Of course, as long as you fill this envelope with hot air."

Roland asked Nightingale to bring Lightning and Maggie as emergency responders, in case of an accident, Lightning and Maggie, transformed into a giant sea eagle, could at least ensure their safe landing. As for the other witches, he decided it was better not to call them for now, especially Wendy and Scroll, who would definitely oppose any risky actions he took—in their eyes, he could not afford to make any mistakes.
