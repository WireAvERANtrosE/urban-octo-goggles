## Blast Furnace
As long as it can cover the surface of an object and form a solid, continuous film, it can be called a coating. The coating itself can be gaseous, liquid, or solid, with various uses. From the initial aesthetic decoration to the later protection of the durability of objects, they are all considered a type of coating.

Roland then conducted a series of tests.



The test results delighted him. Probably influenced by the idea that "the longer a painting is preserved, the better," her previous photo paintings were already difficult to completely remove without destroying the carrier, and her evolved abilities took this feature to new heights.



First, this high-adhesion, lightweight 'pigment' exhibited two distinct physical properties—it could change its own material flexibility according to the different painting subjects. For example, when painting the sky or clouds, it became as soft as marshmallow, with high resistance to stretching and shearing. When it came to iron ingots or glass, it became hard and brittle and could be shattered directly with a hammer. In other words, due to its mass, its performance in flexibility far exceeded its rigidity, which also aligned with Soraya's understanding of pigments.



Secondly, no matter which properties it exhibited, its chemical properties were very stable. It did not react with dilute sulfuric acid or dilute nitric acid and showed repellency to water and oil. When he filled a paper box coated with the pigment with clear water, the thin bottom of the box showed no signs of seepage. After pouring out the water, the clear droplets rolled around inside the box like dew on a lotus leaf. When he touched the bottom with his finger, it still felt dry.



In the high-temperature resistance test, Anna dripped molten iron into the paper box, and as a result, the paper carrier immediately caught fire and burned, but the coating itself had little change except for being pushed open a bit by the molten iron. It wasn't until Anna's black fire continued to heat and burn the coating that it began to melt and deform, emitting white smoke and finally turning into a black, gel-like substance.



What excited Roland the most was that this coating also had insulating properties. It could be considered the enameled wire of later generations when wrapped around copper wire, which he proved with the simple DC generator in the yard.



By now, Roland had a complete understanding of Soraya's new abilities.



Unlike Anna's all-around superior Blackfire that surpassed the Green Flame, her evolved abilities seemed more like an expansion of her previous painting abilities. Now she could paint realistic 'oil paintings' as well as the previous thin 'photo paintings,' depending solely on her thoughts. Both abilities could be used in parallel.



Additionally, when drawing a scroll with thickness, if she controls the thickness to below one centimeter, Soraya can almost continuously draw for several hours. However, once it exceeds three centimeters, the consumption of magic power rapidly increases. After ten centimeters, it reaches a threshold where almost all of her magic power is drained just to add a stroke or two. Of course, from another perspective, this is also the fastest and most effective way to vent when facing the devouring of magic power by the body.



It still belongs to the summoning type of ability. Within the effective range of the Divine Stone of Judgement, the Magic Pen will suddenly disappear, and Soraya can no longer draw new patterns. However, the layers that have already been drawn are not affected by the Divine Stone of Judgement. Under Nightingale's observation, there are no traces of residual magic power on them—in other words, the materials generated by the Magic Pen truly exist.



As for the uses of the coating... there are too many. Soraya herself would never have imagined how much her new ability could change the town. This means that Roland can quickly get a batch of water pipes coated with anti-rust material, as well as large bundles of enameled wire, and even high-temperature resistant fire bricks. The seemingly unreachable infrastructure projects of water supply, electricity, and roads suddenly see the light of dawn.



At the same time, this also serves as a reminder to him: personal experience is far more profound than the axioms on books.



If the witches could more directly observe the microscopic world, wouldn't it accelerate their acceptance of the particle theory and trigger a new round of evolution? For example... a microscope that allows observation of cell structures and microbes.



Roland feels it's necessary to give it a try.



...



Northern Slope Kiln Complex.



"Blow the bellows! Make the fire burn fiercer!" Rosia shouted.



Although he couldn't see inside the blast furnace, with three cartloads of charcoal dumped in, the iron ore must have already been burning red-hot.



When Karl Barton summoned him to Border Town with a letter, he originally thought this place was a desolate and barren land. If the letter hadn't mentioned that the Stonemason Association might be reborn here, he would never have been willing to travel beyond the kingdom's border to resume his old trade.



Preparing to leave his family and pack his bags for departure, he was ready to endure thin porridge and living in tents. As for the issues of being understaffed or underfunded, those were common problems encountered during construction.



Roland had no intention of staying long in Border Town—seeing his old friend Karl, whom he'd known for many years, and looking at those stonemasons who had been exiled or had gone into hiding would have been satisfying enough for him.



But reality is always so incredible.



After arriving in the town by boat, at the dock he met Karl Barton, an outstanding stonemason from the capital of Greycastle, and a strong contender for the next leader of the guild. Karl had more white hair at his temples and a few more wrinkles on his face compared to when he last saw him, but he didn't look emaciated. On the contrary, he seemed much sturdier, and even his face had a healthy glow.



After exchanging pleasantries, Karl didn't take him to a noisy and chaotic construction site, but instead led him to a clearly newly built residential building, handing him a key and saying, "This house is yours now. Drop off your luggage first, and then we can have a good drink at the tavern."



...And then Roland heard a series of incredible stories from him.

Karl, as a commoner, was recruited by the lord into the city hall and became an official with a fixed monthly salary, and he was even the head of the construction department!



If I stayed, I could also work in the City Hall!

A free set of housing is provided!

After working for ten years, you can get a pension! What is a pension? It means getting money without working!

At that time, Rosia thought Karl was drunk, but it turned out... everything he said was true.

"Sir, the ore is melting, I can see the molten iron flowing!" shouted a worker at the top of the furnace.

"Open the slag outlet to discharge the slag!"

After starting work, none of the problems Rosia anticipated occurred. Not only were personnel and funds provided promptly upon request, but responses were often received the very next day. Additionally, there was a type of alchemical material called cement produced here, which could rapidly bind bricks and stones together, greatly accelerating construction speed. Here, Rosia experienced an unprecedented sense of satisfaction.

In just one month, Rosia set up five furnaces with bellows and three blast furnaces for iron smelting.

The blast furnace before him was the culmination of years of contemplation and experience since leaving the Stonemason's Guild. He had thought it would only be passed down on paper, never expecting to see it realized.



The improved blast furnace stood nearly two meters tall with an inner diameter of about seventy-five centimeters. At the bottom of the furnace body, there were several tuyeres for blowing and drawing air, with a slag discharge port and an iron outlet at the base. Next to the furnace was an earthen ramp made of sand and stones, convenient for the workers to add materials and observe the conditions inside the furnace.



Today was the day that the first blast furnace was officially put into use. As per tradition, a smelting test had to be conducted before starting the furnace.



After intermittently opening the slag port more than a dozen times and adding two cartloads of charcoal to the furnace, the inspection was essentially declared successful—the furnace already had molten iron at the bottom, the slag port was unobstructed, and the temperature at this moment could meet the smelting requirements. There was no need to continue wasting charcoal. After all, to reduce loss, the waste ore used for the initial furnace heating test came from the corner of the storage yard.



After opening the iron outlet to discharge the molten iron, Lucia declared a halt to the operation.



...



Two days later, the townspeople cleaning the furnace chamber dug out several dark stones. Exposed to high temperatures, other waste ore had shrunk considerably, but these few ore stones showed little change from when they were first thrown in; instead, their surfaces were even shinier, black as if they were ink.



Lucia could not determine what kind of ore it was. To call it useless waste ore didn't seem right, as its shape and appearance were quite appealing, not like something utterly worthless. But if it were useful, how could one craft it into objects if it could not be melted? After some thought, she simply picked out the most squarely shaped stone, wrapped it in cloth, and instructed her subordinate to make a trip to the castle, to hand it over to the Lord of Border Town, Roland Wimbledon.



Perhaps the well-informed Lord would know the answer.
