## Blast Furnace
As long as it can cover the surface of an object and form a solid, continuous film, it can be called a coating. The coating itself can be gaseous, liquid, or solid, and its uses vary. From the initial aesthetic decoration to the later protection of the durability of objects, they are all considered a type of coating.

Roland then carried out a series of tests.

The results delighted him. Probably influenced by the concept that "the longer a painting is preserved, the better," her previous photo paintings would be very difficult to completely remove without damaging the medium, and her evolved ability elevated this characteristic to a new level.

First, this high-adhesion, lightweight 'pigment' exhibited two starkly different physical properties—it could change its material flexibility according to the different painting subjects. For example, when painting the sky or clouds, it was as soft as marshmallow with high resistance to stretching and shearing. When switched to objects like iron ingots or glass, it became hard and brittle, and could be shattered directly with a hammer. In other words, due to its mass, its performance in flexibility far exceeded that in rigidity, which also conformed to Soraya's understanding of pigments.

Second, no matter which property it exhibited, its chemical property was very stable. It did not react with dilute sulfuric acid or dilute nitric acid and showed repellence to water and oil. When he filled a paper box coated with the pigment with water, the thin bottom of the box showed no signs of seepage. After pouring out the water, the clear droplets rolled around inside the box like dew on a lotus leaf. Touching the bottom with a finger, it still felt dry.

In the high-temperature resistance test, after Anna dripped molten iron into the paper box, the paper used as the carrier immediately caught fire and burned, but the coating itself only bulged a bit from the molten iron and did not change much. It wasn't until Anna's Blackfire continued to heat and burn the coating that it began to melt, deform, and emit white smoke, eventually turning into a black, gel-like substance.

What excited Roland the most was that this coating also had insulating properties. After covering a copper wire with it, it could be considered as the enameled wire of later generations. He proved this with the simple direct current generator in the yard.

At this point, Roland had gained a complete understanding of Soraya's new ability.

Unlike Anna's Blackfire, which completely surpassed the Green Flame in all aspects, her evolved ability seemed more like an expansion of her previous painting ability. Now, she could paint both lifelike 'oil paintings' and the previous thin 'photo paintings,' depending solely on her thoughts. Both abilities could be used in parallel.



Additionally, when drawing a scroll with thickness, if Soraya controlled the thickness to be less than one centimeter, she could almost continuously draw for several hours. However, once the thickness exceeded three centimeters, the consumption of magic power would rapidly increase. After ten centimeters, it would reach a threshold where almost all her magic power would be exhausted after just a couple of strokes. Of course, from another perspective, this was also the fastest and most effective method to vent magic power when facing magic power devouring.



It still belonged to the summoning type of ability. Within the effective range of the God's Punishment Stones, the Magic Pen would suddenly disappear, and Soraya could not continue to draw new patterns. However, the layers that had already been drawn would not be affected by the God's Punishment Stones. Under Nightingale's observation, there were also no traces of residual magic power on them—in other words, the materials generated by the Magic Pen truly existed.



As for the uses of the coating... there were just too many. Soraya herself would never have imagined that her new ability could bring such significant changes to the town. This meant that Roland could quickly obtain a batch of water pipes coated with anti-rust material, as well as large bundles of enameled wire, and even high-temperature resistant firebricks. The once seemingly unattainable municipal engineering projects of water supply, electricity, and roads suddenly saw the light of day.



At the same time, this also served as a reminder to him: Personal experience was far more profound than the axioms on books.



Would it be possible to accelerate the witches' acceptance of the particle theory and trigger a new evolution if they could see the microscopic world more directly? For example... a microscope that could observe the structure of cells and microorganisms.



Roland felt it was necessary to give it a try.



...



The Northern Slope Kilns.



"Blow the bellows harder! Make the fire burn fiercer!" Rosia shouted.



Although he couldn't see inside the blast furnace, with three carts of charcoal poured in, the iron ore inside must have already been burning red hot. 



When Karl Barton called him to Border Town with a letter, he originally thought this place was a remote and barren land. If the letter hadn't mentioned that the Stonemason Association might be able to start anew here, he wouldn't have been willing to travel beyond the kingdom's border to resume his old trade.



Preparing to leave his family and pack his bags, he was ready to endure thin porridge and live in tents. As for whether there were people or money, those were common problems encountered during construction.



Rosia had no intention of staying long in Border Town. He just wanted to meet Karl, his old friend of many years, and see those colleagues from the Stonemason Association who had been exiled or lived in seclusion. That would have been enough for him.



But reality is always so incredible.



After arriving in the town by boat, he met Karl Barton at the dock, an outstanding stonemason from the capital of Greycastle and a strong contender for the next leader of the guild. Karl had more white hair at his temples and more wrinkles on his face than Rosia remembered, but his body hadn't thinned; instead, he looked much stronger, and his face even had a healthy sheen.



After exchanging pleasantries, Karl didn't take him to a noisy and chaotic construction site but instead led him to a clearly newly-built residential building and handed him a key, saying, "This house is yours now. Put your luggage down, and let's go have a good drink at the tavern."



...And then Rosia heard an unbelievable series of stories from him.



Karl had been recruited into the town hall as a commoner by the lord and had become an official with a fixed monthly salary—and even the head of the construction department!



If I stayed, I could also work in the City Hall!

A free set of housing is provided!

After working for ten years, you can get a retirement pension! What is a retirement pension? It means you get money without working!

At that time, Rosia thought Karl was drunk, but it turned out... everything he said was true.

"Sir, the ore is melting, I see molten iron flowing!" shouted a worker at the top of the furnace.

"Open the slag port to remove the slag!"

After starting work, none of the problems Rosia had anticipated occurred. Not only did they provide manpower and money when requested, but they did so with exceptional speed. Often, she would receive a response the day after making a request. Moreover, they produced an alchemical material called cement here, which could rapidly bond bricks and stones, significantly accelerating the construction speed. She felt an unprecedented sense of satisfaction here.

In just one month, Rosia built five furnaces with bellows and three blast furnaces for smelting iron.

The blast furnace before her was the culmination of years of contemplation and experience since leaving the Stonemason's Guild. She had thought it would only be passed down in the form of blueprints, never expecting to see it realized.



This improved blast furnace stands nearly two meters tall with an inner diameter of about seventy-five centimeters. The lower part of the furnace body is equipped with multiple tuyeres for blasting air and drawing out fumes, while the bottom has a slagging tap and an iron outlet. Beside the blast furnace, there is an earth ramp made of sand and stone, convenient for workers to add materials and observe the situation inside the furnace.



Today is the day the first blast furnace is officially put into use, and before starting, a smelting test must be conducted as usual.



After intermittently opening the slagging tap more than ten times and adding two cartloads of charcoal into the furnace, the test is essentially declared successful—the iron has settled at the bottom, the slagging tap is unobstructed, and the temperature can now meet the smelting requirements. There is no need to continue wasting charcoal by burning it. After all, to reduce losses, the waste ore used for the initial furnace test came from the corners of the stockyard.



Upon opening the iron tap and draining the molten iron, Lucia announced the stopping of the furnace.



...



Two days later, the townspeople cleaning the furnace chamber unearthed several pieces of dark stones. Under the high-temperature baking, the other waste ores had shrunk significantly, but these ore pieces remained unchanged from when they were first thrown in, their surfaces even glossier and as black as ink.



Lucia could not determine what kind of ore this was. To call it useless waste ore did not seem right, as its shape and appearance were indeed pleasing; it did not look entirely useless. But if it was useful, how could it be fashioned into objects if it could not be melted? After some thought, he simply picked out the most squarely shaped ore, wrapped it in cloth, and sent one of his men to the castle to hand it over to the lord of Border Town, Roland Wimbledon.



Perhaps the well-informed Lord would know the answer.
