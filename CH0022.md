## Declaration
The day after the rain stopped, Border Town became lively once again. Many villagers gathered in the square, buzzing with discussions as they waited for the speech of the Fourth Prince.

To prepare for this speech, Roland had posted a notice on the bulletin board the day before, stating that anyone who came to the square to listen would receive a serving of wheat porridge and half a loaf of bread. For the townspeople, this was equivalent to a free lunch, so there were even more attendees than there had been for the viewing of an execution.



As it approached noon, Roland ascended the platform that had been constructed.

Facing the dense crowd below, he couldn't lie to himself and say he wasn't nervous. He was used to dealing with computer monitors, and even in meetings, he only had to clap from below the stage; this sort of big event, where he had to personally take the front line, was a first for him.

But he had no choice but to step up. If he wanted to keep everyone in Border Town, a general mobilization was necessary.

Roland waved his hand, signaling for everyone to quiet down.

He had practiced this scene many times alone, but when it came time to take the stage, his mouth was still a bit dry, "My subjects, good afternoon. I am Roland Wimbledon, the Fourth Prince of the Kingdom of Greycastle. I have gathered you here at this moment because there is an important message I must convey to you!"

"Envoys from Longsong Stronghold arrived here four days ago for the ore delivery. As you all know, one month ago, we suffered an unfortunate accident when a collapse occurred in the Northern Slope Mine. To this day, the mining area has not fully resumed production. This accident resulted in only two months’ worth of ore output for the last quarter."

"I explained the situation to the envoy and hoped that he could allocate the full amount of food to Border Town, making up for the shortfall in ore after winter ends. But he refused! Without any room for negotiation, he refused to provide more food—just like two years ago."



Cries of alarm rose from the crowd, clearly, everyone had a deep impression of the food shortage incident two years ago.

"And this time it's obviously worse. The astrologers in the capital told me that this winter will be longer than usual, and the Evil Months may last for more than four months. That is to say, this time everyone may face a two-month food gap. Two years ago, you lost twenty percent of your companions, some lost brothers, some lost children, this time, how many more are you prepared to lose?"

"No! Your Highness, save us!" someone shouted loudly from below, followed by more cries, "Your Highness, please help us!"

It seems that preparing a few shills in advance was the right choice. Roland raised his hand to quell the noise, "Of course, I will not abandon my subjects, not a single one! You may not know that the wheat and bread transported to the stronghold every year are not equivalent to the ore they take away. At normal market prices, just two months of ore would be enough to exchange for half a year's food! I have sold the ore to the merchants of Willow Town, and their ships carrying food will soon arrive at Border Town. In addition to bread, there will also be cheese, honey, wine, and jerky! Enough for an entire winter, everyone will be fed!"

A cheer erupted from the square.

"But this means that we will cut ties with Longsong Stronghold, and they will not take in another person. So, this winter, we will spend it in Border Town. Most of you have seen, on the west side of Border Town, a sturdy wall is being built. I know some are worried about whether we can hold back the demonic beasts when they attack. I want to tell you, the demonic beasts are not much stronger than the beasts in the forest, even though they have thick skin and flesh, they can't climb walls or bite through stone, and with even thicker skin they are just a bunch of pathetic targets!"

"Tell me, my subjects, would you rather cower in the shacks of the stronghold and die ignobly of hunger, or stand under my leadership, protect your loved ones and children, and defend Border Town to the last moment? I promise here that as long as you hold out until the end of the Evil Months, every townsfolk who has fought on the walls will receive a reward of twenty-five Silver Royals. For those who unfortunately perish, their families will receive a compensation of five Gold Royals!"

"We're ready to fight for Your Highness!" Led by the shills, the people shouted in unison, swearing to fight to the death. Seeing the spirits high, Roland timely ordered the distribution of lunch. He did not expect everyone to stay in Border Town, but as long as half were willing to stay, he was confident he could hold back the eastward advance of the demonic beasts here.

...



Peter naturally did not know how the Fourth Prince had arranged for him, but when he brought the news back to the six noble families of the stronghold, all he got was a burst of laughter.



"You're saying that naive prince actually wants to shake us off and go at it alone? Daring to build a wall before winter comes, should I praise his bravery or mock his overestimation of his abilities?"



"The First Prince's cowardice is known to all, when did the Fourth Prince get such courage? He's just ignorant!"



"That's right, he doesn't even have masons, just stacking up unpolished stones and smearing some wet mud in between, I'm afraid it'll collapse under its own weight."



"Anyway, it's a good thing. If he flees back to Longsong Stronghold, he'll be at our mercy. If he dies in Border Town... we can put an end to this farce sooner."



The Duke, who had been deep in thought with his eyes closed, suddenly spoke up, "Peter, what's your opinion?"



Peter was stunned for a moment, not expecting the Longsong Duke to ask for his opinion, "Uh, I originally wanted to maintain the monopoly, as long as it's thirty percent below market price, it's still a worthwhile business for us. However..." His mind quickly organized his thoughts, "However, the prince does not intend to let the stronghold have the exclusive right to operate the mines, he is willing to reduce the selling price of the ore by fifty percent, meaning he has plans to significantly increase the ore output next year. As long as the output can reach double that of the past, we might earn more than before. He also plans to produce and sell ironware on his own, which is in high demand everywhere and easy to resell. But... that's not the point."



"Oh? What's the point?"



"If he can hold onto Border Town, it's also great news for the stronghold. We won't have to spend our energy dealing with demonic beasts every year, which will save us a huge amount of expenses. The second benefit is that the vast land from Longsong Stronghold to Border Town will be ours, whether for cultivation or relocation, it's a good choice, which can greatly relieve the current overcrowded situation in the stronghold." Peter laid out his thoughts one by one, "Moreover, the Fourth Prince will not stay in Border Town forever. The battle for the throne only lasts for five years, after which we will get a more prosperous Border Town. Then, when we incorporate the town into the stronghold, Longsong Stronghold will become the third largest territory in the kingdom. So my suggestion is..." He glanced at the Duke, cautiously saying, "the stronghold should send people to help the prince build the wall and jointly defend Border Town."



"Well said," the Duke chuckled, "but those are the thoughts of a merchant, only able to see the profit and loss."



At this, he straightened his body, his eyes slowly sweeping over the other attendees, his tone gradually turning severe, "However, I did not reach my position today by measuring everything in terms of profit. Why would I want to do business with someone who is not under my control? There are rules that must be followed, and those who break them must accept punishment. Whether Border Town thrives or falls into ruin is not important; what matters is that it is my territory, and no one should think of reaching into it—not even if he is a prince."
