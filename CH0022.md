## Declaration
The day after the rain stopped, Border Town became lively again, with many villagers gathering in the square, waiting for the fourth prince's speech amidst murmured discussions.

For this speech, Roland had posted a notice on the bulletin board the day before. Anyone who came to the square to listen could receive a bowl of wheat porridge and half a loaf of bread. For the town's residents, this was essentially a free lunch, so there were many more attendees than even at a public execution.

As it neared noon, Roland climbed onto the prepared high platform.

Facing the dense crowd below, he would be lying if he said he wasn't nervous. Previously, his most frequent interaction was with computer screens, and even at meetings, he only had to clap from below the stage. This was the first time he had encountered such a grand scene where he had to personally take the stage.

But he had to, if he wanted to keep everyone in Border Town, a general mobilization was necessary.

Roland waved his hand, signaling everyone to quiet down.

He had practiced this scene many times alone, but when he stepped onto the stage, his mouth was still somewhat dry, "My people, good afternoon. I am the fourth prince of the Kingdom of Greycastle, Roland Wimbledon. I have gathered everyone at this moment because there is important news to tell you!"

"An envoy from Longsong Stronghold arrived here four days ago. They came for the delivery of ores. As everyone knows, a month ago, we suffered an unfortunate accident, a collapse occurred at the North Slope Mine. To this day, the mine area has not fully resumed production. This accident resulted in only two months of ore output for the last quarter."

"I explained the situation to the envoy and hoped that he could allocate a full amount of food to Border Town, and make up the shortfall in ores after the winter. But he refused! Without any room for negotiation, he refused to allocate more food - just like two years ago."

There were gasps of shock from the crowd. Clearly, everyone remembered the famine from two years ago vividly.

"And this time, it's going to be worse. The astrologer of Greycastle told me that this winter will be longer than usual, and the Evil Months might last more than four months. That means, everyone might face a two-month food shortage. Two years ago, you lost twenty percent of your comrades. Some lost brothers, some lost children. How many are you prepared to lose this time?"

"No! Your Highness, save us!" Someone in the crowd shouted, followed by more voices, "Your Highness, please, help us!"

It seemed that having a few plants in the crowd was the right choice. Roland raised his hand to quiet the crowd, "Of course, I will not abandon my subjects, not a single one! You might not know this, but the wheat and bread that the fortress brings in every year don't equal the amount of ore they take away. At the market price, just two months' worth of ore can be exchanged for half a year's worth of food! I have sold the ore to the merchants of Willow Town. Their ships carrying food will soon arrive at Border Town. Besides bread, there will be cheese, honey wine, and dried meat! Enough to last the whole winter, everyone will have enough to eat!"

Cheers erupted from the square.

"But, this means we will sever our ties with Longsong Stronghold. They will not house anyone, so this winter, we will stay in Border Town. Most of you have seen the strong wall being built on the west side of Border Town. I know some of you are worried about whether we can hold off the demonic beasts. I want to tell you, the demonic beasts are not much stronger than the beasts in the forest. Even though they have thick skin and tough flesh, they cannot climb the wall, they cannot bite through stone. No matter how thick their skin is, they are just pitiful targets!"

"Tell me, my subjects, would you rather starve to death in the shabby fortress or protect your families and children under my leadership, and defend Border Town to the last moment? I promise you, as long as you hold out until the end of the Evil Months, all the town residents who have fought on the wall will receive twenty-five Silver Royals as a reward. If anyone unfortunately dies, their family will receive five Gold Royals as compensation!"

"Ready to fight for Your Highness!" Guided by the plants, everyone started to shout their willingness to fight. Seeing the high spirits, Roland timely ordered lunch to be served. He did not expect everyone to stay in Border Town, but as long as half of them were willing to stay, he was confident that he could stop the demonic beasts from advancing here.
...

Petrov naturally didn't know how the Fourth Prince had arranged him. When he brought the message back to the six nobles of the fortress, the response he received was only a burst of laughter.
"You say that naive prince actually wants to shake us off and go it alone? Daring to rush to repair the city wall before winter, should I praise him for being brave or ridicule him for overestimating himself?"
"The First Prince's bravery is well known. Since when did the Fourth Prince have such courage? Ignorant!"
"That's right, he doesn't even have a stonemason, just relying on unpolished stones to pile up, pasting some wet mud in the middle, I'm afraid it will collapse once it gets high."
"No matter what, this is a good thing. If he flees back to Longsong Stronghold, we can manipulate him at will. If he dies in Border Town... we can end this farce earlier."
The Duke, who had been closing his eyes in thought, suddenly asked, "Petrov, what's your opinion?"
Petrov was startled for a moment. He didn't expect the Duke of Longsong to ask for his opinion. "Uh, I originally wanted to maintain the monopoly, as long as it's below 30% of the market price, it's still a worthwhile business for us. But..." His thoughts were quickly organizing in his mind, "But His Highness does not plan to let the stronghold monopolize the ore. He is willing to sell the ore at a 50% discount, which means he plans to significantly increase the output of the ore next year. As long as the increase can reach twice of the past, we might earn more than before. He also plans to produce ironware for sale, which is always in demand everywhere and easy to resell. But... these are not the main points."
"Oh? What's the main point then?"
"If he can hold Border Town, it would also be excellent news for the stronghold. We don't have to spend our energy dealing with demonic beasts every year, which can save a huge expenditure. The second benefit is that the vast land from Longsong Stronghold to Border Town will be ours. Whether it's for reclamation or relocation, it's a good choice, and it can greatly alleviate the current overcrowded situation in the stronghold." Petrov put forward the ideas in his mind one by one, "And the Fourth Prince won't stay in Border Town forever. The Royal Decree only lasts for five years, after five years we will have a more prosperous Border Town. By then, incorporating the town into the stronghold, Longsong Stronghold will become the third largest territory in the kingdom. So, my suggestion is..." He glanced at the Duke, cautiously saying, "The Stronghold sends people to help His Highness build the city wall and jointly defend Border Town."

"Well said," the Duke laughed, "But these are all the thoughts of a merchant, only seeing the gains and losses."
As he said this, he straightened up, his eyes slowly sweeping over the other attendees, his tone gradually becoming stern, "However, my position today is not entirely measured by profit. Why should I do business with someone who is not under my control? Some rules must be adhered to, and if violated, one must accept the punishment. Whether Border Town is prosperous or dilapidated does not matter. What matters is that it is my territory, and no one should think of putting their hand in--not even if he is a prince."
