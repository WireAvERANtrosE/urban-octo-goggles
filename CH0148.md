## King's City Merchant (Part 1)
Border Town welcomed a long-awaited rainy day, with dark clouds filling the sky and rain pouring down noisily, hitting the windowsill and glass with a pitter-patter.



In theory, spring should be a rainy season, warm and humid. But in Border Town, since the end of the Evil Months, rain had been scarce. Fortunately, the farmland was right by the river, making irrigation quite convenient. Now, a heavy rain had dispersed the stuffiness in the air, and Nightingale opened the window to let the fragrance of wet earth flood the room.



Looking into the distance, one could see the sprouting crops on the opposite bank of the Redwater River, the green wheat seedlings stretching endlessly towards the horizon. Washed by the rain, these crops appeared extremely vibrant, contrasting sharply with the murky river water.



Roland stretched and tossed the goose feather pen into the holder.



"Finished drawing?" Nightingale asked.



"Mhm, a brand-new weapon that can increase the firing rate of muskets by several times," Roland stacked a dozen or so design drawings neatly, "I've named it the revolver rifle. Want to take a look?"



"No, I don't," she pouted, "I wouldn't understand it anyway."



"This is just the basic model. If the barrel is shortened, it becomes a revolver pistol, which can be carried around. However, to make it useful, another key technology needs to be resolved. When the time comes, I'll issue one to each of you, and you'll no longer have to fear the Church's Judgement Army."



"Are you saying it can allow an ordinary woman to take down a fully armed man?"



"Not just one, several," Roland said with a smug smile. "If we're lucky, even five burly men won't be a problem."

Nightingale looked skeptical and was about to say something when a knock on the door of the office interrupted her.

"Your Highness, Barov's apprentice has returned from the King's City, and he has brought a saltpeter merchant with him. They are now waiting outside the castle for an audience with you."

Barov's apprentice? Roland thought for a moment before he remembered the matter. When they attacked the Longsong Stronghold, the town's gunpowder reserves had been nearly depleted, so he had sent guards to Fallen Dragon Ridge and Redwater City, hoping to find new sources of saltpeter. Barov's apprentice was the last one sent out, and his destination was the King's City. After all, every kind of commodity could be found there, and with summer approaching, the production of saltpeter would surely increase greatly.

Unexpectedly, the last person sent out was the first to bring back good news.

"Have them come to the parlor; I'll be there shortly," Roland said, glancing at the sky. "And have the kitchen prepare some desserts."

When he turned back, Nightingale had already vanished.

But he knew she was right there, beside him.

...



As Roland entered the reception room, the saltpeter merchant had just been led in by the guards. She took off her wet cloak and straw hat, bowed to the prince, and said, "I am Margaret Farman from the capital, my respects to you, Your Highness Prince Wimbledon."



Seeing that the visitor was a woman, Roland was slightly taken aback. In this era, the environment for traveling merchants was far from as safe as in later times. On the road, they could encounter bandits and refugees, and towns had local snakes and underground forces, so female merchants were uncommon.



She had brilliant blonde hair, just like Lightning, but it was denser and longer. She looked to be around thirty years old, and perhaps because she was a commoner, she had wrinkles at the corners of her eyes and on her forehead. Her skin was dark and seemed rough at first glance. However, her face did not resemble that of a Mojin person; she looked more like a person from the Fjords.



"Please, have a seat," said the prince with a gesture, then he sat down in the main seat. "You're not from Greycastle, are you?"



"Why do you say that?" Margaret smiled.



"Your hair color is very rare in the continent's kingdoms. As far as I know, most people from across the strait have beautiful blonde hair, and I also know someone from over the sea... an explorer."



"You are indeed knowledgeable. My homeland is indeed in the Fjords, but I have come over more than a decade ago, and now I live in the capital, so I am half a Greycastle person." She paused, "You've just left the capital not long ago, we might have met somewhere. I feel very honored to live in the same city as Your Highness."



Indeed, a successful merchant knows how to speak well, Roland thought, knowing that she was flattering and trying to get close, yet he still felt quite pleased. Just then, he felt a pinch on his right side... Uh, there's no need to judge the truth at this moment, the zealous and responsible comrade Nightingale.



"However, speaking of explorers, that is an extraordinary title in the Fjords," Margaret continued. "Perhaps you don't understand, but the land where the Fjord people can survive and live is very scarce. There, the sea rises and falls, some islands are submerged during high tide, while others are always erupting with flames and smoke, and stones melt under high temperatures, forming dark red rivers. Only those who open new sea routes, or find new suitable islands to live on, have the right to earn this title. Ordinary people would not claim to be explorers."



"Ha ha, not only does she call herself an explorer, but she also refers to her father as the greatest explorer," Roland laughed, shaking his head. "Kids, they always like to imagine themselves as great figures."



"In the Fjords, even children wouldn't lightly claim that title," Margaret frowned. "Did she mention her father's name?"



Seeing her expression, Roland realized something was amiss. Could it be that the term 'explorer' was a spiritual belief among the sea folk, not to be casually invoked? "Her father's name is Thunder."



To his surprise, as soon as he mentioned the name, her eyes went round with shock. "You know Lord Thunder?"



"No, I know his daughter. Why, have you heard of this name?"



"Who in the Fjords hasn't heard that name! Lord Thunder discovered Twin Peaks Island and Sea Dragon Bay, nearly doubling the living territory for everyone. He also drew detailed maps of the eastern coast and the Endless Cape. Now, eighty percent of the sea routes to the continent were pioneered by him. Every child is familiar with Lord Thunder's deeds; he is one of the greatest explorers of the Fjords!"



"But I've heard that Thunder was lost at sea in a storm..."



"No, Your Highness, a true explorer would not fall to a storm. He has faced countless dangers and always returned successfully. Right now, Lord Thunder must be somewhere assembling a new exploration team, just like he has done before." Margaret leaned forward slightly. "Your Highness, do you know the whereabouts of his daughter now?"



Roland was also taken aback; he had not expected Lightning's father to be so famous. Were those fantastical tales of exploration also true? "She's living in my castle. After the shipwreck, she drifted westward to Border Town, and I happened to take her in."



"In your castle?" Her expectant expression was overflowing with anticipation. "Could... could I meet his daughter?"



"Uh, that might not be possible right now," Lightning should be patrolling around the Misty Forest, searching for the ruins marked on the 'treasure map.' "She's currently practicing... jungle exploration skills. If you plan to stay here for the night, you should be able to wait until she returns."



"Then I shall impose upon your hospitality." Margaret nodded without hesitation.



"Shall we discuss the main issue now?"



"Of course, Your Highness," she said with a smile. "Please feel free to speak."
