## King's City Merchant (Part 1)
Border Town welcomed a long-lost rainy day, with the sky filled with dark clouds and rain pouring down, hitting windowsills and glass, creating a pitter-patter sound.



Logically speaking, spring should be a rainy season, warm and humid. But in Border Town, since the end of the Evil Months, the number of rainy days could be counted on one's fingers. Fortunately, the farmland was right by the river, making irrigation quite convenient. Now, a heavy rain had dispersed the stuffiness in the air, and Nightingale opened the window, letting the fragrance filled with the scent of wet earth flood the room.



Looking into the distance, one could see that the cropland across the Redwater River had already sprouted new shoots, with the green wheat seedlings extending continuously, all the way to the edge of the field of view. Washed by the rain, these crops appeared exceedingly vibrant, forming a stark contrast against the murky river water.



Roland stretched and tossed the goose feather pen he held into the pen holder.



"Are you finished?" Nightingale asked.



"Yep, a brand-new weapon that can increase the firing rate of the musket by several times," Roland stacked about a dozen design drawings neatly on top of each other, "I've named it the revolving rifle. Want to take a look?"



"No thanks," she pouted, "I wouldn't understand it anyway."



"This is just the basic model. If the barrel is shortened, it becomes a revolving pistol that can be carried around. But to make it truly effective, another key technology must be resolved. When the time comes, I'll issue one to each of you, and you'll no longer need to fear the Church's Judgement Army."



"Are you saying it can enable an ordinary woman to take down a fully armed man?"



"Not just one, several," Roland said with a proud smile. "With a bit of luck, five strong men wouldn't be a problem either."

Nightingale looked incredulous, and was just about to say something when a knock suddenly came from outside the office.



"Your Highness, Barov's apprentice has returned from the capital, and he has brought a saltpeter merchant with him. They are now waiting outside the castle for your audience."



Barov's apprentice? Roland thought for a moment before he remembered the matter. When they were attacking the Longsong Stronghold, the town's gunpowder reserves were almost depleted, so he had sent guards to both Dragon Cliffs City and Redwater City, hoping to secure a new source of saltpeter. Barov's apprentice was the last one sent out, with the capital as his destination. After all, the capital had all sorts of goods, and with summer approaching, the production of saltpeter was sure to increase significantly.



Unexpectedly, the one who was sent out last brought back the good news first.



"Take them to the parlor, I'll be there shortly," Roland said, glancing at the sky. "And have the kitchen serve up a dessert."



When he turned back around, Nightingale was already out of sight.



But he knew that she was right beside him.



...



When Roland walked into the drawing room, the saltpeter merchant had just been led in by the guard. She removed her wet cloak and straw hat, bowed to the prince, and said, "I am Margie Faman from the capital, at your service, Your Highness Prince Wimbledon."



Roland was slightly taken aback to see that the visitor was a woman. In this era, the trading environment was far from as safe as it would be in later times; traveling merchants not only faced the risk of bandits and refugees but also local bullies and underground forces in towns, making female merchants a rare sight.



She had brilliant blonde hair just like Lightning, only denser and longer. She appeared to be about thirty years old, and perhaps because she was an ordinary person, wrinkles had begun to show at the corners of her eyes and on her forehead. Her skin was a darker shade and seemed rough at first glance. However, from her facial features, she did not appear to be a Mojin person but rather like someone from the Fjords.



"Please take a seat," the prince gestured, and then he sat down in the master's seat, "You're not from Greycastle, are you?"



"Why do you say that?" Margie asked with a smile.



"Your hair color is very rare among the kingdoms of the continent. To my knowledge, the people across the strait mostly have beautiful blonde hair, and I also know an... explorer from over there."



"You are very well-informed. My homeland is indeed in the Fjords, but I have been away from there for more than ten years. Now I live in the capital, and I consider myself half a Greycastle person." She paused, "You have just left the capital not long ago; we might have met somewhere. It's an honor for me to have lived in the same city as Your Highness."



Indeed, a successful merchant always knew what to say. Even though Roland knew she was flattering and trying to get on his good side, he still felt quite pleased inside. Just at that moment, he felt a strong pinch on his right side... Ah, there was no need to judge the truth at such a time, the enthusiastic and responsible comrade Nightingale.



"However, speaking of explorers, that's quite a distinguished title in the Fjords," Margie continued, "You might not be aware, but the land where the people of the Fjords can live and survive is very scarce. There, the sea level rises and falls, and some islands are submerged during high tide, while others spew flames and smoke all day long; the rocks melt under the high temperatures, forming dark red rivers. Only those who open new sea routes or discover new suitable islands for living are entitled to this appellation. Ordinary people don't claim to be explorers."



"Ha-ha, not only does she call herself an explorer, but she also refers to her father as the greatest explorer," Roland chuckled, shaking his head. "Children love to imagine themselves as great figures."



"In the Fjords, even children wouldnâ€™t casually claim that title," said Margaret, frowning. "Did she mention her father's name?"



Seeing her expression, Roland also realized something was amiss. Could it be that the term 'explorer' is a spiritual belief of the sea folk, not to be used carelessly? "Her father's name is Thunder."



As soon as this name was mentioned, the other party's eyes went wide, "You know Lord Thunder?"



"No, I know his daughter. Why, have you heard of this name?"



"Who in the Fjords hasn't heard of this name! Lord Thunder discovered Twin Dragon Island and Sea Dragon Bay, nearly doubling the territory where our people reside. He also charted detailed maps of the East Coast and the Endless Cape; today, eighty percent of the sea routes to the continent were opened by him. Every child is well-versed in Lord Thunder's deeds; he is one of the greatest explorers of the Fjords!"



"But I heard that Thunder seemed to have perished in a storm at sea..."



"No, Your Highness, a true explorer would not fall to a storm. He has faced countless dangers and always returned successfully. Right now, Lord Thunder must be somewhere, assembling a new exploration team, just like he has done before." Margaret leaned forward slightly, "Your Highness, do you know the whereabouts of his daughter now?"



Roland was slightly surprised; he hadn't expected Lightning's father to be so famous. Were those adventure stories, which sounded like tall tales, also true? "She lives in my castle. After encountering a shipwreck, she drifted westward to Border Town, and I happened to take her in."



"In your castle?" Her expectant expression was more than evident. "Could I... meet his daughter?"



"Um, it might not be possible right now," Lightning should be patrolling around the Misty Forest at this moment, searching for the ruins marked on the 'treasure map.' "She's currently practicing... jungle exploration skills. If you plan to stay here for the night, you should be able to wait until she returns."



"Then I will impose on your hospitality." Margaret nodded without hesitation.



"Can we discuss the main matter now?"



"Of course, Your Highness," she said with a smile. "Please feel free to speak."
