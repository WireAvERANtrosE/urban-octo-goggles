## Assassin
As Weed took off his patch-filled coat and put on the brand-new uniform, he felt warmth spread throughout his body.

The uniform had a thick leather exterior with a layer of cotton lining inside, combining the warmth of a leather coat with the softness of cloth. The materials alone were probably worth several Silver royals.

Although the design of the uniform was similar to that of the Town Hall, the colors were completely different—the base color of the clothes was pure black, with white striped lace on the shoulders, collar, and cuffs, making it very striking. After the fifteen of them got dressed in their new uniforms and stood in line again, they couldn't help but puff out their chests a bit more.

"Not bad," Carter said with a satisfied smile. "Now, follow me."

Snowflakes were still drifting from the sky, and it was the first time Weed had seen snow that kept falling from autumn without a break. Snow would occasionally fall in Golden City, but it would usually stop after a day or two. Children would often build snowmen on the side of the streets or throw snowballs at each other, giving rise to the saying that a snowy day was a childhood festival. However, for adults, it was quite inconvenient—the snow would moisten and mold their shoes, make the streets difficult to navigate, drive away business from shops, and sometimes even collapse the roofs of houses.

At such times, the patrol team would definitely not go out. If they did go out, it would only be to find a tavern where they could sit around the fireplace, drinking warm barley beer and flirting with the maids.

But none of this could be seen in Border Town.

Every day, people would clear the snow from the streets, sweeping it to the sides—this was a long-term recruitment issued by the Town Hall, payable daily or monthly, a job with low returns but quick money.

There were many townsfolk coming and going on the streets, some wearing straw hats, others draped in cloaks, all busy with their own tasks. If all the snow in the town were cleared away, one could say it was summer without a problem.



If not for seeing it with his own eyes, Veed would never have believed that a small town on the kingdom's border could look even busier than Golden City. If it weren't for the lack of towering churches and bell towers, he would have thought he was in some major city.



Soon, the group arrived at the dockside. Over a dozen sailboats were moored on the Redwater River, and hundreds of people had gathered on the shore. This scene seemed familiar... That's right, Veed thought, it was a similar sight when he and other refugees from the Eastern Region arrived at the town.



"Report! These people are..."



"Refugees from the south and the Northland. His Highness has specially arranged for them to be brought to Border Town to ensure they can safely get through the winter," Carter ordered. "Your duty is to assist the City Hall in maintaining order, to have these people queue up and go through the inspection checkpoints one by one, then undergo quarantine and registration. The police force is still short-handed, so soldiers from the First Army will assist you. In the future, this task will have to be done by yourselves independently."



"Yes, sir!"



It didn't sound difficult, similar to directing refugees to queue for porridge. Veed walked to the checkpoint and began to shout loudly, instructing people nearby to follow his commands and gather around.



"Your name? Where are you from? Do you have any skills, and can you read?"



Each refugee passing through the checkpoint was questioned by the City Hall staff, followed by a brief record of their details. Veed knew this was just a preliminary tally; after everyone was settled, there would be further review and verification. Those with special skills would be prioritized for relocation to the inner city district—this was a process he had already experienced firsthand.



Suddenly, a commotion arose behind him. Veed turned around to see a man in a furry long robe, accompanied by a group of guards, arriving at the dock area. The flowing grey hair indicated his identity—the local lord, Prince Roland Wimbledon. Besides, several elegantly dressed individuals stood by his side, likely key officials from the City Hall.



Unexpectedly, His Highness the Prince braved the snowstorm to personally inspect these refugees, which slightly surprised Ved. Few nobles are willing to leave the warmth of their beds early in the morning during the frigid season, especially when servants handle everything for them.

"My name is Mane, a Northerner, uh... I'm good at, good at farming. I'm illiterate."

"Farming?" The City Hall official ticked the corresponding box on the record form, "Alright, you may pass."

Just then, Ved noticed that as the man passed through the checkpoint, he glanced in the direction where His Highness the Prince was standing, without a trace of awe in his eyes, completely different from the usual gaze of commoners.

"Wait," he said subconsciously.

"Wh-what is it?"

"You're a farmer? In which month should winter wheat be sown?"

The City Hall official also looked at him, showing some impatience on his face, "We're just doing preliminary registration right now, I don't have the time to verify if each of them is telling the truth. Didn't Lord Carter explain the procedure to you? Your only job is to help me maintain order."

Hearing this, the man immediately shut his mouth.



What a fool! Waid frowned and said dismissively, "Your accent doesn't sound like that of the northern residents; it's more like the habitual accent of the central region of the kingdom. Are you from that town in the North? I'm very familiar with that area."

Mane hesitated, still not answering.

"Also, your attire—dressed like that in the North, you would have frozen to death, or at the very least, your fingers would have suffered frostbite. It's below freezing there all year round." Waid grabbed his right hand, "Where are your gloves? Don't tell me you threw them away when you came to Border Town after finding out it's warmer here."

Now the checkpoint personnel also sensed something was amiss. If someone falsely claimed proficiency in something, it could be to receive better treatment, but hiding one's origins was odd. "Where exactly are you from?"

Mane gritted his teeth and suddenly pulled out a red pill from his bosom, slamming it into his mouth and bellowing, "All of you back off!"

Waid immediately felt the other's wrist turn scorching hot. He reflexively tried to push Mane to the ground, but found that even with all his strength, the other man didn't budge. Then, with a lift of Mane's arm, Waid felt himself flying through the air.

He crashed to the ground, feeling a searing pain in his back. Damn, the wound had split open. He spat out some saliva and shook his dizzy head, turning over to get up, but Mane was already gone.

Four or five refugees burst out from the crowd, their movements as agile as the demonic beasts outside the walls. With a few strides, they vaulted over the temporary barriers set up by the City Hall and headed straight for His Highness the Prince.

The purpose of this group couldn't have been clearer—they were targeting the high-ranking officials and lords of Border Town.



Thinking of the monstrous strength that burst forth from his mane, Veed could almost imagine the scene where the prince's personal guards were torn to shreds on the spot, and even the prince himself would hardly escape the calamity. 



However, none of this happened. 



He soon heard a series of ping-pong sounds—just like when the soldiers on the city walls confronted the demonic beasts. 



Puffs of white smoke rose in front of the prince. 



The mane's head turned into a burst of blood flowers amidst the smoke.
