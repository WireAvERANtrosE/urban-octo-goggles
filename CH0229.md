## Eve of the Return Journey
On the third day, outside the eastern gate of the King's City.



Nightingale was hidden in the mist, silently watching the group of ragged refugees. Under the Echo's sound transmission spell, they were being gathered in waves and followed Knight Theo slowly towards the docks.



Now they no longer had to weave through the edge of the refugee camp like the previous two days, gradually dispersing and leading people away bit by bit. The large number of fleeing people made the remaining ones take notice of this, and as long as a group was pulled away from the edge, more would continuously follow. Even the guards on the city walls noticed what was happening at the base of the walls, but for them, they couldn't wait for these foul-smelling refugees to scram.



The entire plan was progressing very smoothly; there were hardly any refugees left in the eastern district, and the people by the north gate were actively moving towards this side. Probably before the sun set, everyone would be able to leave by boat smoothly.



While everyone else was busy, she seemed to be rather idle—Echo was surrounded by layers of "mercenaries" responsible for guiding, and Lily was even producing purified water under the heavy protection of the First Army, making her own guard duty seem somewhat superfluous.



It was only when the "mercenaries" dispersed to carry the seriously ill patients, who were unable to move, that she needed to be more vigilant. It was at this moment that Nightingale saw Echo looking up at the majestic eastern city gate and let out a soft sigh.



"What's wrong?" she walked over and asked.



"It's nothing, I just feel a bit sentimental," Echo's expression was a bit sad. "Before I was sold into the King's City, I had suffered a lot along the way. I originally thought that the people of Greycastle were so cold to me because of my identity as a person from the Sand People, but now it seems that they are just as ruthless to their own kind, not much different from the people in Ironsand City."



Thinking about how Echo had once been bought and sold as a slave, Nightingale didn't know how to comfort her. In the end, she could only pat her on the shoulder, "But not everyone is like that, there are still many who are kind-hearted, like the sisters from the Mutual Aid Society, and like… Prince Roland."



"Do you think... His Highness can really put an end to the disputes?" Echo asked softly, "Whether it's the kingdoms of the continent, the Sand People, the Fjords, or the common folk and witches, can they really live together freely and peacefully without fighting each other?"

"If it's His Highness, I think he can," Nightingale replied with certainty, "It's not because of those strange machines or the powerful cannons that I feel this way, but because of him himself... I always feel that His Highness is not the same kind of person as us."

"Of course, he's not the same. He's a prince of Greycastle."

"No, it's not about status," she shook her head, "I can't quite pinpoint where this sense of difference comes from, it's just intuition. Probably only someone like His Highness could come up with so many bizarre and peculiar theories... even for the abilities of witches, he wants to study them over and over again, his way of thinking is just different from others. Anyway, no matter what amazing things he creates, I won't be surprised anymore."

"You really have a lot of confidence in him," Echo chuckled, her melancholy expression lightening considerably, "I hope when that day comes, I can return to the Far South to have a look."

Confidence? In some ways, yes, but in others... she had no certainty at all. Nightingale couldn't help but look towards the Western Territory, wondering what he was doing when she wasn't around? Was he busy with those blueprints and strange machines, or with Anna... She shook her head vigorously, dispelling these distracting thoughts.

Anyway, after today ended, she would be able to set off back to Border Town, Nightingale thought. She would simply ask him directly then, since he wouldn't be able to lie in front of her anyway.

...

When they returned to the camp to rest at noon, Lightning also slowly descended.



These days, she has been patrolling the skies under the blazing sun, truly the most arduous among the team. Especially for concealment purposes, Lightning even had to don a "sky camouflage" coat specially made by Soraya, wrapping her body tightly and covering even her hair. This garment, given an odd name by Prince Roland, was clearly not designed for looks. Its exterior painted with a mix of light blue and gray-white patterns, when flying in the sky, it almost blended into the background, making her existence difficult to notice unless one looked closely.



The first thing the young girl did after landing was to take off the coat and grab a water bag to chug water. Nightingale saw that her clothes underneath were soaked with sweat, her forehead and the tip of her nose covered with beads of sweat, and a circle of indentations from her wind goggles remained on her pale cheeks.



"You've worked hard," Nightingale squatted down to help her wipe the sweat.



"Thank goodness these people are not endlessly rushing from the Eastern Region," Lightning stuck out her tongue, "otherwise, I might really faint from the sun."



"Can we return home tomorrow?" Lily came over to Lightning listlessly, "I haven't had a shower in days, and I feel uncomfortable all over."



Nightingale couldn't help but laugh. Back when they were at the Mutual Aid Society, everyone went almost half a month without the chance to bathe, and no one complained; now, it's only been a little over a week. She suddenly thought that the bathroom and soap might all be part of Prince Roland's "scheme"—ever since he invented those strange yet handy things, it would probably be very difficult for the witches to resolve to leave Border Town again.



However, the tranquility didn't last until the end of the transport. After lunch, Theo, who went to the King's City to gather intelligence, brought back bad news.



"You mean... Dreamwater is gathering her followers and might plan to surround the docks?" Iron Axe frowned.



"It's 'perhaps' planning to surround the docks," Theo corrected, "The first part is a definite fact, while the second half is too bizarre, so my informants are not sure. Now, other underworld organizations in the King's City have started to take action, in case Dreamwater suddenly attacks their territories. However, instead of believing that 'surrounding the docks' is a smokescreen deliberately released by them, I am more inclined to believe that they leaked the news along the way—this is quite common for rats. After all, most members of the underworld organizations are riff-raff or scum, hardly a tight-knit organization. If the intelligence is accurate, then Dreamwater must be under the orders of some power; otherwise, it would be very difficult for them to leave their own territory."



"A bunch of rats," Iron Axe said nonchalantly, "But will these people running around affect your medicine selling plans?"



"It shouldn't," Theo said, "They can't get their hands into the patrol team, so it's unlikely they'll hinder my access through the side gate. As for after entering the city, the Skeleton Finger will provide protection for the convoy transporting the potion. I'm just worried about you guys because I must stay in the city tonight to supervise the sale of the purification water, and I'm afraid I won't be able to see you off early tomorrow morning."



"No matter," Iron Axe patted his arm, "We'll meet again when His Highness comes to the capital in person."



Just as Nightingale had anticipated, at dusk, the last batch of boats carrying refugees slowly left the dock, heading towards Silver City. The more than three hundred people who were unwilling to leave the capital were ordered to disperse by Iron Axe.



Then everyone retreated to the opposite side of the canal, waiting for the night to fall.
