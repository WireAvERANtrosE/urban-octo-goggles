## Eve of the Return Journey
On the third day, outside the eastern gate of the King's City.

Nightingale hid in the mist, quietly watching the group of ragged refugees. Under Echo's voice transmission spell, they were gathered in waves and followed Knight Brian, slowly moving towards the dock.



Now they no longer had to weave through the edge of the refugee camp like the first two days, coaxing and leading the crowds away bit by bit. The massive migration of the refugees made the remaining people take notice; as soon as a group was pulled away from the edge, more would continuously follow. Even the guards on the city walls noticed the happenings at the base of the wall, but for them, they couldn't wait for these stinking refugees to get lost.



The whole plan was progressing very smoothly. There were hardly any refugees left in the eastern district, and those near the northern gate were actively moving towards this side. Probably by sunset, everyone would be able to board the ships and leave.



While everyone was busy, she seemed quite at leisure—Echo was surrounded by layers of "mercenaries" responsible for guiding the people, and Lily was under the heavy protection of the First Army, producing purified water, making her guard duties seem somewhat superfluous.



Only when the "mercenaries" dispersed to carry those who were seriously ill and unable to move did she need to be more vigilant. It was at this moment that Nightingale saw Echo looking up at the majestic eastern city gate and sighing softly.



"What's wrong?" she approached and asked.



"Nothing much, I'm just feeling somewhat sentimental," Echo's expression appeared a bit sad, "Before I was sold into the King's City, I suffered a lot along the way. I originally thought that the people of Greycastle were so cold to me because of my Sand People identity, but now I see that they are just as ruthless to their own kind, not much different from the people of Iron Sand City."



Thinking of Echo's past as a slave bought and sold, Nightingale was at a loss for words on how to comfort her. In the end, she could only pat her shoulder, "But not everyone is like that. There are still many who are kind-hearted, like the sisters from the Mutual Aid Society, and like... Prince Roland."



"Do you think... His Highness can really stop the conflicts?" Echo whispered, "Whether it's the kingdoms of the continent, the Sand People, the Fjords, or ordinary people and witches, can they all live together freely and peacefully without fighting each other?"

"If it's His Highness, I think he can," Nightingale replied with certainty. "It's not because of those strange machines and the astonishing cannons that I feel this way, but because of him... I always feel that His Highness is not the same kind of person as us."

"Of course he's not the same as us, he's the prince of Greycastle."

"No, it has nothing to do with status," she shook her head, "I can't pinpoint where this sense of difference comes from, it's just intuition. Perhaps only someone like His Highness could come up with so many bizarre and peculiar theories... Even wanting to thoroughly research witches' abilities over and over, his way of thinking is different from others. Anyway, no matter what astonishing things he invents next, I won't be surprised."

"You really have faith in him," Echo chuckled, her melancholy somewhat alleviated by the laughter, "I hope when that day comes, I can return to the Far South to see it."

Faith? In some ways, yes, but in other ways... she had no certainty at all. Nightingale couldn't help but look in the direction of the Western Territory, wondering what he was doing in her absence. Was he busy with those drawings and strange machinery, or with Anna... She shook her head vigorously, dispelling these distracting thoughts.

After all, once today was over, she would set off to return to Border Town, Nightingale thought. Then she could ask him directly; after all, he wouldn't be able to lie in front of her.

...

When she returned to the camp to rest at noon, Lightning also slowly descended.



These days, she had been patrolling the skies under the blazing sun, truly the hardest worker in the team. Especially for the sake of concealing her figure, Lightning had no choice but to don a "sky camouflage" coat specially made by Soraya, wrapping her body tightly and even covering her hair. This garment, endowed with a peculiar name by Prince Roland, was clearly not designed for aesthetics. Its exterior was painted with a mix of light blue and grayish-white patterns that almost blended her into the background when flying; without looking carefully, it was very hard to notice her presence.



Upon landing, the first thing the young girl did was to take off her coat and grab a water bag to gulp down water. Nightingale noticed that Lightning's clothes underneath were soaked with sweat, her forehead and the tip of her nose covered with beads of perspiration, and a ring-shaped imprint from her goggles left on her white cheeks.



"You've worked hard," Nightingale squatted down to help her wipe off the sweat.



"Luckily, these people aren't endlessly rushing over from the eastern border," Lightning stuck out her tongue, "Otherwise, I really would have passed out from the heat."



"Will we be able to return home tomorrow?" Lily walked over to Lightning listlessly. "I haven't taken a shower in several days, and I feel uncomfortable all over."



Nightingale couldn't help but laugh. Clearly, back in the Witch Cooperation Association, everyone had gone nearly half a month without the chance to bathe without any complaints, and now it had only been a little over a week. She suddenly thought that the bathroom and soap might very well be part of Prince Roland's "conspiracy"—ever since he invented those strange yet useful things, it would probably be very difficult for the witches to resolve to leave Border Town again.



However, the calm did not last until the end of the transportation. After lunch, Tassa, who had gone to the king's city to gather information, brought back bad news.



"You mean... Dream Water is gathering his followers and is planning to surround the docks?" Iron Axe frowned.



"It's 'perhaps' planning to surround the docks," Tassa corrected. "The first part is a confirmed fact, but the latter half is too bizarre, so my informants aren't sure. Now, the other black street organizations in the capital have all started to move to prevent Dream Water from suddenly attacking their territories. However, rather than believing that 'surrounding the docks' is a smokescreen deliberately released by the other side, I am more inclined to believe that they let the information slip along the way—which is quite common for rats. After all, most members of the black street organizations are just riffraff or scum, hardly a tight-knit organization. If the information is accurate, then Dream Water must have been instigated by some power; otherwise, it would be very difficult for them to leave their own territory."



"Just a bunch of rats," Iron Axe said nonchalantly, "But will these people running around affect your medicine selling plan?"



"It shouldn't," Tassa replied, "They can't get their hands into the patrol team, so it's unlikely they can obstruct me from using the side gate. As for after entering the city, the Skull Finger will provide protection for the convoy transporting the potions. I'm just worried about you guys, because I have to stay in the city tonight to supervise the sale of the purification water, and I'm afraid I won't be able to see you off tomorrow morning."



"No worries," Iron Axe patted his arm, "We'll meet again when His Highness comes to the capital in person."



As Nightingale had predicted, by dusk, the last batch of ships carrying refugees slowly left the dock and headed for Silver City. The remaining three hundred or so people who were unwilling to leave the capital were dispersed by Iron Axe's orders.



Then everyone evacuated to the opposite side of the canal, waiting for nightfall.
