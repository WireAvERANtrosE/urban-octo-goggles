## Knight
When Brian woke up, the first thing he saw was the gray-white ceiling.

The sunlight streaming in from the window was a bit dazzling, so he closed his eyes for a moment, then reopened them, but the scene before him remained unchanged.

It's not a dream, he thought, am I... still alive? He tried to move his body, only to find that he could barely wiggle his fingers; his strength seemed to have been completely drained.

Then he heard someone shout, "He's awake, quickly go notify His Highness."

His Highness? Brian felt as if his mind was clogged with paste, his thoughts much slower than usual. Right, how did I pass out? It seemed he had been pierced through the chest by a venomous snake, and was about to die. In the last moments, a ghostly woman appeared out of nowhere and defeated all the enemies in an inconceivable way...

Soon, a maid helped him sit up against the head of the bed, while another brought over a basin of water to wash his face. Brian had never experienced such thorough and intimate service, and being surrounded by young maids made him feel somewhat awkward.

Fortunately, this discomfort did not last long. When the Fourth Prince entered the room, everyone bowed.

Brian's heart surged with a burning sensation; he had so many questions he wanted to ask. But when he opened his mouth, he didn't know what to say first. However, Roland nodded and said, "I am already aware of your deeds, Brian. You are truly a hero."

As soon as the word "hero" was spoken, Brian felt his eyes sting, and his voice choked up, "No... Your Highness, my friends are the real..."



Roland patted his shoulder in comfort.



Just as Nightingale had predicted, after Scarface was dragged to the torture chamber, he spilled everything he knew without even waiting for the warden to lay a hand on him.



The mastermind behind this team was not his royal brother or sister, but the Elk family from Longsong Stronghold. The Elk Count had contacted his distant relative, Hillis Mead, which is to say, Scarface, and through bribery and division, had taken control over most of the patrol members. In addition, he had also sent an expert to replace one of the team as insurance, in case anything unexpected happened during the operation. Their goal was not to assassinate him, but to burn the pure grain, to force him to obediently return to the stronghold.



This conspiracy resulted in the death of an innocent—Greyhound. He tried to stop the criminal attempt of Scarface and his group and was stabbed to death by the patrol members. The team member who was replaced by the 'snake' disappeared without a trace, probably realizing the plan had been exposed when he found out that the castle hadn't caught fire and Scarface hadn't returned on time, and fled directly.



Once Brian's emotions had stabilized, Roland spoke, "Your friend Greyhound, he will be given a funeral that befits his status. His family will also be properly taken care of, and they won't have to worry about food anymore."



"Thank you, Your Highness," Brian took a deep breath, "May I ask... is Scarface dead too?"



"He is still alive."



The patrol captain closed his eyes in pain; he would rather not have been rescued if it meant dragging the other down to hell with him. But now, this hope had become slim... Without a doubt, Scarface was guilty, but a noble's crimes could be atoned for with money. As long as his uncle was willing to protect him, Scarface was very likely to avoid death. In fact, he might not even see the inside of a prison.



Roland naturally guessed his thoughts, "Hillis Mead, also known as Scarface in your words, is a member of the Longsong Stronghold Elk family. The head of the family is called Locken Mead, an earl enfeoffed by Duke Lion, and also his distant uncle..." At this point, he paused slightly, "But none of these will affect the final verdict. Scarface has been sentenced to hanging, to be carried out in three days. If you are well enough by then, you might want to see it for yourself."



Brian's eyes widened in shock, "But... but Your Highness, nobles can atone for their sins with Gold royals, won't this action provoke—"



Roland waved his hand, signaling him to calm down, "Nobles? Perhaps to you, he comes from the Elk Family, and his status is worlds apart from yours. But in fact, he holds neither a noble title nor fiefdom, he's not truly a noble. Second, even if he were a noble, invading the prince's palace, attempting to burn the stored grain, disregarding the lives of more than two thousand people of Border Town, these three heinous acts together are unforgivable."



If Roland had any hesitation about Tyra's death, Scarface was utterly unforgivable. If he had succeeded, Roland's foundation in Border Town would have been destroyed in one fell swoop, with no chance of recovery, which was far more detestable than a direct assassination attempt on himself.



As for whether this reaction would anger Longsong Stronghold, who cares? Since they were unwilling to do business properly and chose to deal a heavy blow to Border Town, Roland certainly couldn't back down. This incident also served as a warning to Roland—that the political struggles of this world were not like those he was familiar with from his past, mostly confined to under-the-table dealings, but rather more inclined to flipping the table, much more primal and bloody.



"Get some good rest, you've lost too much blood, there's no need to leave the castle. I've arranged for someone else to take over the patrol duties, and after the Evil Months are over, I will hold a knighting ceremony for you."



"Your Highness," upon hearing the latter part, Brian looked incredulously at the prince, "You mean..."



"Yes, you will become my knight, Sir Brian," Roland replied with a smile.



...

"Ready—Thrust!"



Tanner gritted his teeth and thrust the long wooden pole in his hands with the same force and at roughly the same angle as before.

This was the one hundredth thrust he had made.

A numb soreness traveled through his arms, and Tanner felt like he couldn't go on any longer. He had thought the same thing when he reached the fiftieth thrust, but a week's worth of training had conditioned him to reflexively obey the command. To be honest, even he was surprised that he had managed to hold on until now.



"Everyone—take a break!"

After Iron Axe shouted the order, a collective sigh of relief swept through the area. Tanner also breathed a sigh of relief, put down the spear shaft, and plopped down onto the ground.



By now, he had finally understood that the militia he was a part of was not a belly unit responsible for running errands for the guards or knights. After a week of bizarre training, their drills had gradually started to take shape. For example, now they were standing on the town wall, following the hunter's commands to thrust and retract the spears—though these spears were substituted with wooden sticks, Tanner could quickly imagine the role he was meant to play.



The logistics team would never do such drills, which also meant that they would be confronting the demonic beasts head-on atop the town walls. Just the thought of it was terrifying enough, and Tanner had originally planned to sneak away. But for some reason, seeing his fellow trainees around him, thinking about the hearty meals three times a day and the considerable pay, he just couldn't bring himself to make that decision.
