## Knight
When Brian woke up, the first thing he saw was a gray ceiling. 

The sunlight pouring in from the window was a bit dazzling. He closed his eyes slightly, then opened them again, but the scene in front of him remained unchanged. 

Not a dream, he thought, I... am I still alive? He tried to move his body, but found that he could only wiggle his fingers, as if all his strength had been drained out of him.

Then he heard someone shout, "He's awake, go inform His Highness quickly."

His Highness? Brian felt like there was a lump of paste stuffed in his brain, his thoughts were much slower than usual. Right, how did I pass out? Seems like I was pierced in the chest by a venomous snake, on the verge of death, when a woman who looked like a ghost suddenly appeared and defeated all the enemies in an unbelievable manner...

Soon, a maid helped him sit up and lean against the head of the bed. Another one brought a basin of water to help him wash his face. Brian had clearly never experienced such meticulous personal care, especially by young maids, which made him a bit at a loss.

Fortunately, this awkwardness didn't last long. When the Fourth Prince entered the room, everyone bowed. 

Brian felt a surge of heat in his heart. He had so many questions to ask, but when he opened his mouth, he didn't know where to start. It was Roland who nodded and said, "I have already heard of your deeds, Brian, you are a true hero."

Upon hearing the word "hero", Brian's eyes suddenly became sour and his voice choked up, "No... Your Highness, my friend is the real..."



Roland patted his shoulder for comfort. 

Just as Nightingale had predicted, Scarface spilled everything he knew like beans from a bamboo tube after being hauled into the torture chamber, before the jailer even had a chance to lay a hand on him. 

The mastermind behind this operation was not his royal brother or sister, but the Moose Family from Longsong Stronghold. Count Moose contacted his distant relative, Hillis Medde, also known as Scarface, and with the promise of benefits and manipulation, he gained control over most of the patrol members. In addition, he sent an expert to replace one of the members as insurance in case anything went wrong during the operation. Their goal was not to assassinate Roland, but to burn down the pure grain and force him to retreat back to the stronghold. 

Their plot resulted in the death of an innocent person - Greyhound. He attempted to stop Scarface's criminal endeavors and was stabbed to death by the patrol members. The member who was replaced by the viper disappeared and probably fled when he realized the plan had been exposed after finding out the castle had not been set on fire and Scarface hadn’t returned on time. 

Once Brian had calmed down, Roland said, "Your friend Greyhound will receive a funeral fit for his status. His family will be properly taken care of and they won't have to worry about food in the future." 

"Thank you, Your Highness," Brian took a deep breath, "Is Scarface...dead?" 

"Not yet." 

The patrol captain closed his eyes in agony. He would rather have not been rescued if it meant dragging Scarface down to hell with him. But now that hope seemed distant...Scarface was undoubtedly guilty, but a noble's crimes could be diminished with money. If his uncle was willing to protect him, Scarface had a good chance of surviving, maybe even without going to jail. 

Roland could guess his thoughts, "Hillis Medde, or Scarface as you call him, is a member of the Moose Family from Longsong Stronghold. The family head is called Locke Medde, a count bestowed by Duke Ryan, and is his distant uncle..." he paused slightly, "But none of this will affect the final verdict. Scarface has been sentenced to hang, the execution will take place in three days. If you recover in time, you might want to see it."



Brian's eyes widened abruptly, "But...but Your Highness, nobles can redeem their sins with Gold royals, wouldn't this incite ——"

Roland waved his hand, signaling him to calm down, "Nobles? Maybe for you, coming from the Elk family, his status is vastly different from yours. But in fact, he has neither a title nor a fief, he is not a noble at all. Secondly, even if he was a noble, invading the prince's palace, attempting to burn the stored grain, disregarding the life and death of over 2,000 people in Border Town, these three crimes combined are unforgivable."

If one could say that Roland had some hesitation about Tyra's death, Scarface belonged to the completely unforgivable category. If he had succeeded, his foundation in Border Town would have been destroyed in an instant, never having a chance to turn over, which is far worse than directly assassinating himself.

As for whether this reaction would anger Longsong Stronghold, who cares? Since the other side was unwilling to do business with him properly and chose to harm Border Town, he certainly couldn't back down. This incident also gave Roland a warning — the political struggle in this world is not like what he was used to, mostly focused on underhanded tactics, but more inclined to flip the table, much more primal and bloody.

"Rest well, you've lost too much blood, don't leave the castle. I've already arranged for others to take over the patrol team's duties. After the Evil Months are over, I will hold a knighting ceremony for you."

"Your Highness," hearing the last sentence, Brian looked at the prince in disbelief, "You mean......"

"Yes, you will become my knight, Mr. Brian." Roland replied with a smile.

...

"Prepare — stab!"



Van'er gritted his teeth and thrust out the long wooden pole in his hand with the same force as before, the angle roughly the same. This was the hundredth time he had done so. A numb sensation spread through his arm, Van'er felt he couldn't go on, although he had thought the same at the fiftieth time, a week's worth of training and conditioned reflex still made him obey the command. To be honest, even he was surprised he lasted this long.



"All - Rest!"



As Iron Axe shouted the command, a collective sigh of relief echoed around them. Van'er also breathed a sigh of relief, put down his pole, and plopped down to sit on the ground.



By now, he finally understood that the militia he belonged to was not a weak unit responsible for running errands for the guards or knights. After a week of strange training, their practice exercises gradually began to look more like the real thing. For example, standing on the city wall and thrusting and retracting their long spears according to the hunter's commands - although these spears were replaced by wooden poles, Van'er could quickly associate the role he was playing.



The logistics team would never do such exercises, which also meant that they would be confronting the demonic beasts head-on on the city wall. The thought alone was terrifying, Van'er originally planned to sneak away, but for some reason, seeing his fellow trainees, thinking of the rich meals every day and the generous salary, he couldn't make up his mind to do so.
