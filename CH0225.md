## Avenger
In fact, there was more than one such rat. Iron Axe watched emotionlessly as the captured man was brought before him. "You are already the third person to jump ship and flee. The refugees also said you did not come from the Eastern Region. Do you have any last words you wish to confess?"



The two people who had been caught before had two fingers cut off with a short sword, and they immediately confessed everything about their origins and purposes. Of course, their bodies had already been thrown into the canal—Iron Axe was never a merciful man. His experiences in the struggles at Iron Sand City taught him that the best way to deal with these sneaky probes was to sever every overreaching hand. However, to his surprise, this fellow kneeling on the ground with his hands tied behind his back looked quite healthy, not at all like he was stricken with disease.



Could he be a death warrior sent by some power?



"I am not your enemy," he said, causing Iron Axe to slightly startle, "My name is Hill Fawx, Theo knows my name!"



...



At that time, Theo had not yet left the dock area. Summoned by Iron Axe's men, he glanced at Hill and said with a sneer, "This man is a subordinate of Black Hammer."



"He's not your man?" Iron Axe asked.



"He has nothing to do with me, just a rookie rat."



"You deceived Black Hammer, and you also deceived Skeleton Finger," Hill suddenly spoke up, "You are not working for Timothy, but for His Highness Roland Wimbledon of the Western Region!"



"He knows too much," Theo made a throat-slitting gesture towards Iron Axe. "The best place for this man is at the bottom of the canal."



He continued to speak on his own: "I heard all the content that mercenary was propagating. We can cooperate! I am willing to serve Prince Roland!"



"The Prince does not need the loyalty of rats," Iron Axe drew his sword.



"I am not a rat, I am... a freeman of King's City, I am an enemy of Timothy!" Hill shouted loudly.



"Wait," Theo called out to Iron Axe, walking up to him. The latter looked up, unafraid to meet the gaze of the bodyguard, his eyes seemingly ablaze with something.



So that's it... This is the answer I've been unable to figure out since the first time I saw him, Theo thought. His eyes were filled with hatred, so intense that even though he tried to hide it, he couldn't fully mask the fury.



"Speak, why do you wish to serve the Prince?"



"I do indeed live in the Northern District and occasionally go to the Underground Pipers to drink, but I am not here because I gambled away my fortune, and my wife did not run off with someone else..." Hill said through gritted teeth, "She was killed by Timothy!"



The story was not complicated, and Theo quickly understood the ins and outs of it.



He and his wife were originally members of the "Dove and Top Hat" Circus, often performing in the inner city of King's City. The circus was small, with only seven people, but the atmosphere was very harmonious. His wife, being the only woman in the group, was pursued by everyone. In the end, Hill Fox won the victory and captured her heart. Life after marriage was very sweet, and before long, they would be able to save enough to buy a house in the inner city. However, all of this was destroyed by Timothy's witch-hunting campaign. Under the leadership of Lanley, the patrol team, like a pack of mad dogs, wantonly arrested suspects, and his wife was one of the unfortunate ones to be mistakenly captured.



Hill Fox originally thought that as long as he paid a ransom, he would be able to get his wife released, or at least be able to visit her in jail. The prison warden took the ransom but did not release her, nor did he agree to Hill's request to visit her, reassuring him that she would naturally be released once it was confirmed that she was not a witch. Unexpectedly, the situation took a sharp turn for the worse. When he was notified to collect someone from the prison, what he saw was a body covered in wounds.



Hill Fox angrily demanded justice from Lanley, but in the end, the warden, the head jailer, and the guards were only sentenced to ten lashes and a fine of twenty-five Silver Royals, while he himself received a compensation of three Gold Royals. Hill Fox could not accept such a verdict at all. He even sought out the highest-ranking officer of the patrol team, Sir Weimar of the "Steelheart Knights," but this was still to no avail. The knight told him that Lanley was a trusted follower of Timothy Wimbledon, and those new members of the patrol team were also his henchmen. At the same time, the witch hunt was the will of His Majesty, and even the Minister of Justice, Barov, would not say a word for him.



Thus, Hill Fox decided to take revenge on the new king, and to his surprise, this decision was supported by all his fellow performers in the circus. However, a group of actors with no combat skills, wealth, or followers seeking revenge was an almost unattainable goal. All Hill Fox could think of was to collect information on Timothy and provide it to his enemies, such as Queen Grace of Clearwater. They each joined different underground organizations to lie low and gather any clues related to the new king.



He secretly monitored Theo's movements for this reason—if Theo wanted to expel these refugees, he should try his best to stop him. However, before he could act, the demonic plague broke out, and Theo also halted the refugee transportation. It was not until today that Hill Fox discovered that these people were on the move again. To find out what was going on, he simply disguised himself as a refugee and blended into the crowd, only to finally realize that the man Theo truly served was Roland Wimbledon, the fourth prince of Greycastle.



Without a doubt, as one eligible to compete for the throne of Greycastle, he was also a major enemy of Timothy.



Perhaps in Hill Fox's eyes, as long as the new king could be overthrown, even serving the devil was worth the cost.



"The last question, when you mingled with the crowd to gather information, didn't you think about the possibility of being infected yourself?" Theo asked with interest, "I don't think a person with a goal of revenge would take his own life so lightly."



"I have an antidote," Hill Fox hinted with a pout of his lips, "It's in the pocket of my underwear, bought for me by my circus comrades from the black market, spending almost all their savings."



Theo reached out to touch it and pulled out a transparent little bottle the thickness of a forefinger, which seemed to be filled with a section of blue liquid. He handed the bottle to Iron Axe, "The Holy Medicine of the Church... I think His Highness would be interested in this."



"This man..." as Iron Axe took the bottle, he asked, "What do you think?"



"Um," Theo touched his chin. If it were any other time, without any way to verify the truth of his words, he would choose the safest course of action—sending him on his way. However, the camp just happened to have someone who could accurately determine if he was lying, "I want to invite Miss Nightingale to verify this."



...



In the evening, Theo returned to The Underground Hand.



Black Hammer's spirits were clearly not very good; the recent spread of the demonic plague had reduced the tavern's business to rock bottom, and the infection of the silver rings and clay pots only increased his unease.



Hill acted as if nothing had happened, sitting across from Theo with his usual slight restraint.



The personal guard smiled slightly and tossed a small bag of Gold Royals in front of Black Hammer, "No need to be so downcast, I have some good news to tell you, there's more business coming."



Black Hammer counted the coins and put them in his chest, speaking listlessly, "I'm not taking any more business. With the demonic plague rampant, who dares to wander outside? The money we earn isn't even enough to buy Holy Medicine for everyone. Do you know how expensive a bottle of medicine is on the black market now? At least twenty-five Gold Royals!"



"What a coincidence," Theo chuckled, "the business I was about to mention also happens to involve selling medicine," he paused, "...a specific remedy for the demonic plague."
