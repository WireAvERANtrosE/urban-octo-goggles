## Avenger
In fact, there was more than one such rat. Iron Axe looked emotionless at the person who was caught, "You're already the third person to jump ship and flee. The refugees also say you didn't come from the Eastern Region. Do you have any last words to confess?"



The two people who were caught before immediately confessed everything about their origins and purposes after having two of their fingers cut off with a short sword. Of course, their bodies had already been thrown into the canal—Iron Axe was never a soft-hearted person. His experience in the struggles of Ironsand City taught him that the best way to deal with these kinds of sneaky probes was to chop off each overreaching hand. However, what surprised him was that this guy, whose hands were tied behind his back and was kneeling on the ground, looked very healthy and didn't seem to be sick at all.



Could it be an assassin sent by some power?



"I am not your enemy," the first words he spoke took Iron Axe aback, "My name is Hill Fawkes, Tilly knows my name!"



...

Tilly had not left the dock area yet, and after being called over by Iron Axe's subordinate, she glanced at Hill and said with a sneer, "This man is a subordinate of Black Hammer."



"He's not your man?" Iron Axe asked.



"He has nothing to do with me. Just a rookie rat," Tilly said.



"You deceived Black Hammer as well as the Skeleton Finger," Hill suddenly spoke up, "You're not working for Timothy, but serving the Prince of the Western Territory, His Highness Roland Wimbledon!"



"He knows too much," Tassa made a throat-slitting gesture to Iron Axe, "The best place for this man is at the bottom of the canal."

He continued to speak for himself: "I heard everything that mercenary was promoting; we can collaborate! I am willing to serve Prince Roland!"

"His Highness does not need the loyalty of rats," Iron Axe drew his sword.

"I am not a rat, I am... a freeman of the King's City, an enemy of Timothy!" Hill shouted loudly.

"Wait," Tassa stopped Iron Axe, walked up to him, and the latter raised his head without fear to meet the gaze of the guard, his eyes seeming to burn with something.

So that's it... This was the answer that Tassa hadn't understood when he first met him. His eyes were filled with hatred, a hatred so intense that it couldn't be completely concealed by his attempt to hide it, even then.

"Let's hear it, the reason you want to serve His Highness."

"I do indeed live in the Northern District, and I occasionally go to the Underground Flute for drinks, but I am not here because I gambled away all my assets, and my wife did not run off with someone else..." Hill said through clenched teeth, "She was killed by Timothy!"

The story was not complicated, and Tassa quickly understood the whole situation.



He and his wife were originally members of the "Dove and Top Hat" acrobatic troupe, often performing in the inner city area of the capital. The troupe was small, with only seven people, but the atmosphere was very harmonious. As the only woman in the troupe, his wife was pursued by everyone unanimously. In the end, Hill won the victory and captured her heart. Life after marriage was very sweet, and it wouldn't be long before they could save enough to buy a house in the inner city. But all of this was destroyed by Timothy's witch-hunting campaign. Under Lanley's leadership, the patrol team, like a pack of mad dogs, recklessly captured suspects, and his wife was one of the unfortunate ones wrongfully captured.



Hill Fawkes originally thought that as long as he paid the ransom, he could get his wife released, or at least visit her in jail. The warden took the ransom but did not release her, nor did he agree to Hill's request to visit the cell, instead reassuring him that she would naturally be released after it was confirmed that she was not a witch. To his horror, when he was notified to collect her from the prison, he was presented with a body covered in wounds.



Hill angrily demanded justice from Lanley, but in the end, the warden, the head jailer, and the guards were only sentenced to ten lashes and a fine of twenty-five Silver royals, while he himself received a compensation of three Gold royals. Hill could not accept such a verdict, and he even sought out the highest official of the patrol team, Sir Weimar, the "Steel-heart Knight," but to no avail. The knight told him that Lanley was Timothy Wimbledon's confidant, and those new members of the patrol team were also his henchmen. At the same time, witch hunting was His Majesty's will, and even the Minister of Justice, Patro, would not say a word for him.



Therefore, Hill was determined to take revenge on the new king, and to his surprise, this decision was supported by all his comrades in the troupe. However, a group of actors without combat prowess, wealth, or followers had almost no chance of seeking revenge. The only thing Hill could think of was to collect information on Timothy and provide it to his enemies, such as Queen Grace of Clearwater. They joined various underworld organizations to lie low and collect any clues related to the new king.



He secretly monitored the movements of Tassa for this reason—if Timothy wanted to expel these refugees, he should try to stop him as much as possible. However, before he could act, the demonic plague broke out, and Tassa also stopped transporting the refugees. Until today, Hill discovered that these people were on the move again. To find out the truth, he simply disguised himself as a refugee and blended into the crowd, only to discover that the person Tassa truly served was Roland Wimbledon, the fourth prince of Greycastle.



Without a doubt, as someone eligible to compete for the throne of Greycastle, he was also a great enemy of Timothy.



Perhaps in Hill's eyes, as long as he could bring down the new king, he would be willing to work for the devil.



"The last question, when you mingled into the crowd to gather information, didn't you ever consider the possibility of being infected?" Tassa asked with interest. "I don't think someone with a goal of revenge would take their life so lightly."



"I have the antidote," Hill pursed his lips to indicate, "right in the pocket of my underwear, bought for me by my comrades in the troupe, who spent almost all their family's wealth on the black market."



Tassa reached out his hand to touch something, then pulled out a transparent small bottle as thick as a finger, which seemed to be filled with a segment of blue liquid. He handed the bottle to Iron Axe, "The Holy Medicine of the Church... I think His Highness would be interested in this."



"This person..." Iron Axe asked as he took the bottle, "What do you think?"



"Um," Tassa stroked his chin. If it were any other time, without any way to verify the truth of his words, he would choose the safest approach—directly sending him off. However, it just so happened that there was someone in the camp who could accurately determine whether he was lying, "I would like to ask Miss Nightingale to verify this."



...

As evening approached, Tassa returned to the Underground Hand.



Black Hammer's spirits were clearly not too well; the recent spread of the demonic plague had brought the business of the tavern to a freezing point, and the infection of the silver rings and pottery only added to his unrest.



Hill sat opposite Tassa as if nothing had happened, with her usual slight restraint.



The personal guard smiled slightly and tossed a small bag of Gold royals in front of Black Hammer, "No need to be so down, I have some good news for you, there's more business coming."



Black Hammer counted the coins, then put them in his pocket, and said listlessly, "I'm not taking any business. With the demonic plague rampant, who dares to wander outside? The money we make isn't even enough to buy Holy Medicine for everyone. Do you know how expensive a bottle of medicine can sell for in the black market now? At least twenty-five Gold royals!"



"What a coincidence," Tassa smiled, "The business I want to discuss also happens to be about selling medicine," he paused, "…A specific remedy for the demonic plague."
