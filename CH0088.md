## Twilight of Winter (Part 2)
"Don't be so anxious, it hasn't come over yet," Roland sighed as he looked at the eager Lightning.

Heaven knows why she was so interested in challenging demonic beasts; she was clearly not the fighting type, yet she had none of the fear that ordinary people should have when facing demonic beasts. "Use the same method as we did with the first one, don't overdo it. You are just luring the demonic beast, drawing its attention to you. Keep your altitude! It can't fly, but it's still quite threatening when it jumps!"



"I got it, I got it," Lightning replied confidently, "I figured out everything about it when the first one came. Don't worry, it won't even touch the hem of my clothes."



As they spoke, the mixed-breed demonic beast had already approached the city wall, crossing over a barrier zone and leaping fiercely towards an unguarded section, flipping onto the top of the wall. However, this time, no militia members paid it any attention; they stayed in their own defensive sections, waiting for the next stabbing command from the hunter observers.



"So, special operations against the mixed-breed demonic beast begin now!" Roland said in a deep voice.



Lightning, who had already flown out, stopped and looked back at Roland.



"What's wrong?"



"That phrase of yours..." Lightning thought for a moment, then shook her head, "It's a bit strange. Anyway, I'm off."



Watching the young girl's figure swiftly receding into the distance, Roland chuckled awkwardly and asked Anna and Nightingale behind him, "Did you also think it was strange?"



"Alright..." Both of them nodded in unison.



Alright... it seems that even in another world, cheesy lines are still cheesy, "Then you should go as well, and be careful."



"Your Highness, you too." Nightingale said with a bow, then she took Anna's hand and entered the Mist.



Roland stood with his hands clasped behind his back, facing the wind, trying his best to strike the pose that a big boss should have. He knew that many people would sneak a glance back at him during the lulls in the battle, so despite his numb feet, he remained standing at the highest point of the city wall, making sure he was visible to everyone—showing that the prince was with them at all times. Since he couldn't join the battle himself, he could at least inspire people in this way.



This demonic beast attack had exceeded the intensity of any previous assault. According to Iron Axe, in past Evil Months, only one or two mixed breeds would appear, but counting now, this year Border Town had already encountered four mixed breed demonic beasts. The duration was also exceptionally long, with the beasts continuously emerging from the Silent Forest in batches of dozens, ceaselessly charging towards the city walls.



Fortunately, the production of flintlock guns had greatly increased in the past month, and now a hundred-man gun squad had been fully armed. Otherwise, it would have been impossible to maintain such a high killing speed. If they were using crossbows, they would probably be struggling just to draw the strings by now. In a war of attrition, the small physical exertion required by firearms became increasingly apparent. Of course, the sharp increase in the consumption of gunpowder was enough to give Roland a headache, and he was already considering dismantling the more than twenty bags of explosives in the warehouse to retrieve the gunpowder for the gun squad.



On the other side, Lightning had already flown over the head of the mixed breed demonic beast. She took a stone out of her pocket and threw it at the beast. The stone hit the creature's head precisely, and the sudden attack caused it to stagger backward, only then realizing that the assault had come from the air.



Lightning provocatively lowered her altitude, flew past it, and skimmed towards the center of the town. Although the mixed breed demonic beast had a certain level of thinking ability, the little girl in front of it was clearly deemed non-threatening. It immediately pounced forward, spreading its wings, and glided nearly a hundred meters in just a few leaps. Lightning immediately pulled herself up, made a turn in the air, flew over a few bungalows, and turned into another street.



In this way, after several twists and turns, she lured the enemy to the central square of the town, which was also the agreed attack site between her and Nightingale. Since the lion-headed, winged mixed breed had a very sensitive sense of smell, even Nightingale in the Mist could be detected, so before Nightingale and Anna launched their attack, she had to do her best to keep the demonic beast's attention.



Lightning performed marvelously. The hybrid demonic beast was now visibly enraged, its increasing ferocity masking the little reason it had. It opened its mouth wide and leapt into the air several times, but Lightning, unburdened by any weight, was far more agile than the monster. She darted up and down, toying with it, rendering each of its jumps futile.



Nightingale had also reached the square from another direction—unlike Lightning, once she entered the Mist, she completely ignored the houses and fences on her path, advancing in a straight line. Anna's flame had a range of only ten steps (5 meters), so approaching from behind the tail was necessary to decrease the likelihood of the demonic beast noticing her.



There had been some complications when dealing with the first hybrid, but by now Nightingale had fully familiarized herself with Anna's method of attack. When she was still thirty steps away from the beast, she accelerated to her limit; the ground seemed to shrink beneath her, allowing her to cover the remaining distance in almost one step. By the time Anna came to her senses, the monster's tail was nearly brushing against her face.



"Now!" Nightingale shouted.



The black and white world around Anna receded like the tide, and in the blink of an eye, she was back in the familiar town square. Green fire quietly appeared at her fingertips, then grew into a massive cage of flames that enveloped the demonic beast's head.



Nightingale quickly retreated as the intense heat wave that followed caused her to feel a burning sensation.



In the face of temperatures that could melt steel, the demonic beast didn't even have the chance to struggle before it was transformed into a fireball and collapsed with a thunderous crash.



"It seems they've taken care of it," Wendy, who had taken Nightingale's place as a temporary guard, said as she watched the rise of the green flames in the distance, pouting slightly. "It looks like I wasn't much help..."



"If I could, I would wish for none of you to have to enter the battlefield," Roland replied, maintaining his hands-behind-back stance, trying to sound nonchalant. Despite his words, he was well aware that had the witches not joined the battle line to assist today, the militia would have surely descended into chaos against the hybrid demonic beasts capable of leaping over the city walls.



Even Nana had come under the city wall, where under the protection of Baron Titus, she rapidly treated those warriors who had been injured by mischance. This was the first time Roland publicly revealed the power of witches in front of all the militia members, and the result greatly pleased him. Nana, known as the 'Healing Angel' among the troops, had clearly taken the reputation of the witch group to a new height. After Anna and Nightingale had joined forces to kill the first demonic hybrid on the city wall, there was even a moment when cheers arose from the crowd.



Of course, he was aware that not everyone would be indifferent to this; such a situation was already quite remarkable. With a preliminary consensus established among the militia, his subsequent plans could be implemented much more conveniently.



All of a sudden, the gunfire on the city walls became sparse, and Roland noticed that the demonic beasts had begun to retreat from the walls. They were actually retreating? He could hardly believe his eyes. Just then, a beam of light penetrated the thick clouds and fell upon the ground, followed by a second, then a third... Soon, the gloomy sky was riddled with countless beams of light, each merging into the others, becoming dazzling and indescribable. The land suddenly brightened.



"The day the sun rises once again marks the end of the Evil Months."



There was a brief calm on the city wall, followed by a wave of cheering that swept across the defensive line. Gradually, the townspeople also came out of their houses and joined in the shouting. They were jubilant for the long-missed sunshine, for having safely endured the winter, and for their prince. All the voices eventually converged into a torrent, echoing through the entire border town!
