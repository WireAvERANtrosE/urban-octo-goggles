## Negotiation
Roland was dragged out of bed by Nightingale. Upon hearing that Nana Pine's father had come to see him, he was initially shocked, but quickly realized this was a rare opportunity. If he wanted to keep the young girl to help fight against the Evil Months, he had to find a reason for the Pine family to stay in Border Town for the winter. 

Initially, this was a tricky matter. The fourth prince's reputation had plummeted among the nobility, and his tense relationship with the stronghold only made things worse. The nobles whose estates were located in the eastern district of the fortress were unlikely to stay in the small town. From the very beginning, Roland had never considered cooperating with the nobility. They might be good at fighting for power and profit, but they were not suitable for fighting side by side.

He quickly dressed and washed up, then went to the reception room. Titus Pine, who had been left waiting for a long time by the personal guards, was already fuming with anger. Upon seeing the prince, he immediately stood up, "Your Highness, where is my daughter?"

This was Roland's first time meeting Nana's father. He was a burly man, not very tall, his face surrounded by a rugged beard. His outfit consisting of a belted cotton jacket and large pocketed trousers made him look more like a hunter than a noble. 

"She's fine, Mr. Pine—"

"Why would your guards let her in but keep me waiting outside?" Titus interrupted forcefully, "I need an explanation, Your Highness! Please bring my daughter to see me!"

What was going on? Roland was taken aback. He had imagined that Titus would either humbly beg him to conceal the news of his daughter becoming a witch or straightforwardly ask him to solve this problem. But he hadn't expected the forceful, completely impolite Pine.

As for why the guards let Nana in, it was entirely due to his own instructions. She came to see Anna every couple of days, and the guards were familiar with her.

After a moment's consideration, Roland summoned a maid and asked her to bring Nana over.

No matter how rude the other party was, he was still Nana's father. It was better to let the two meet first and then discuss further. If he showed any intention of handing the little girl over to the church or abandoning her, he could take action later.

Nana came out with Anna.

The moment Titus Pine saw his daughter, the impatience in his eyes immediately disappeared. He opened his arms and shouted to Nana, "Come to Daddy."

But the little girl just hid behind Anna, poking out half of her head, "Are you going to sell me to the church?"

"Cough...What are you talking about, silly girl, the church doesn't take fools like you, come home with me."

This reaction left Roland somewhat puzzled. According to Nightingale, Nana had been seen using her magic by her father and had fled to the castle in panic to find Anna, with her father furiously pursuing her all the way here.

But now, it seemed that the look in Titus's eyes when he looked at his daughter was only concern and adoration, not at all like the common hatred for witches.

"Did I get something wrong?" 
Roland hesitated for a moment, then decided to speak openly, "Mr. Pine, your daughter is a witch, I presume you already know this."

"What are you talking about, Your Highness, I don't understand." Titus stomped, stepping forward to grab Nana's hand but was blocked by Anna.

"Father, I have become a witch... I'm sorry," Nana said in a low voice. 

Titus finally started to panic, "Stop talking nonsense! What witch, did Karl teach you that? I knew I shouldn't have let you go to the academy, the church's teachings are all nonsense!" 

Hearing this, Roland suddenly understood something. Perhaps all the actions Titus had taken to cover up for Nana were due to a misunderstanding about him? 

So, before he had seen his daughter, he was so anxious.

"Anna," he winked at the witch, who nodded. Facing Titus, who tried to walk past her to pull Nana away, Anna extended her right hand. Flames spurted from her palm, shooting over his head.

Titus's eyes widened, he stepped back in panic, Nana also clung to Anna's arm in fear, "Sister Anna, don't!"

"Your Highness, this is--!"
"As you can see, she is also a witch, just like your daughter," Roland spread his hands, "The reason why Nana can freely enter and exit the castle is not as you think. Can we talk properly now?"
It was only then that Titus seemed to wake up from his dream, uttering two "ahs", "Your Highness, I..."
"Sit down and talk," Roland pointed to the table, "Have a cup of tea first."
Indeed, he sighed in his heart, my reputation is so bad, so bad that even children are not spared. Roland now fully understood the other party's initial rude behavior. A father who cares about his daughter, seeing his daughter run into the lord's castle, and the guards at the gate acting as if it was commonplace, what does this imply?
If the person involved was himself, he would probably have the heart to tear down the castle bare-handed.
As for the constant denial that his daughter is a witch, the intention is even more obvious—Titus was worried that the prince would threaten him with the rhetoric that "Nana has fallen and needs to be purified", while he himself, didn't care at all whether his beloved daughter was a witch or not.
Titus hesitated for a long time, but in the end he just plopped down, picked up the tea cup and gulped it down, wiped his mouth, and looked somewhat embarrassed, "Sorry, I was rude. May I ask when you knew my daughter had become, uh... a witch?"
"Before winter. The first to discover her awakening was not me, but her teacher, Karl Barton. Because of his friendship with Anna, he entrusted Nana to me, hoping I could protect her," Roland explained in detail, "And in the past month and a half, she would come to the castle to practice her ability whenever she had free time. By the way, your daughter's ability is healing."

"Is that so..." Titus scratched his head, "I was wondering why that cat could suddenly run and jump."
"Cat?"
"Cough, it's actually nothing. When I was coming home, I saw this child holding a cat that was hit by a carriage at the entrance, I was planning to scare her from behind, but she ran when she saw me, and the cat did the same, even though its leg was obviously broken," he glanced at Nana and Anna, "Are you friends?"
Before Anna could respond, Nana's head was already nodding rapidly.
Titus's expression softened a few degrees.
Seeing this, Roland asked, "You don't seem to believe that witches are evil beings seduced by the devil."
"My daughter is certainly not an evil being!" He declared firmly, "No matter what she has become, there is no doubt about that!"
He was completely different from Anna's father, Roland couldn't help but sigh. He now understood why Nana was always carefree and always had a smile on her face. Such a family was like a warm cradle for a child.
"I don't think so either, Mr. Pine," the prince said bluntly, "Your daughter's ability is of great significance to the injured. I hope she can stay in Border Town and help me fight against the Evil Months."

Titus hesitated, "Your Highness, please forgive me for refusing. When the Months of Demons descend, this place will become extremely dangerous, I cannot leave her in the town."

The fiefdom of Titus Pine did not belong to the jurisdiction of Border Town, therefore, even if he was a prince, he could not directly command him. However, Roland thought, as long as he was willing to sit down and talk, there was no fear of not persuading him.
