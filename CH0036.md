## Negotiation
Roland was dragged out of bed by Nightingale.

After learning that Nana Pine's father had come to look for him, he was initially startled, but he quickly realized that this was a rare opportunity—if he wanted the little girl to stay and help fight against the Evil Months, he had to find a reason for the Pine family to stay in Border Town for the winter.

This was originally a very tricky matter, as the reputation and prestige of the fourth prince had plummeted to the bottom among the nobles. Furthermore, with the strained relations with the stronghold, it was unlikely that these nobles, whose estates were all in the eastern district of the stronghold, would stay in the small town. Roland had never considered cooperating with the nobles from the start; they might be adept at fighting for power and profit but were not suitable for fighting side by side in battle.

He quickly got dressed, washed up simply, and went to the parlor.

Titus Pine, who had been left waiting in the room by the guards for a long time, was fuming with anger. Upon seeing the prince, he immediately stood up, "Your Highness, where is my daughter?"

This was Roland's first time seeing Nana's father. He was burly and not tall, with a ring of stubble on his face that made him look extremely rugged. His attire, with a waistcoat and large pockets on skin-tight pants, made him look more like a hunter than a noble.

"She is fine, Mr. Pine—"

"Why did your guards let her in directly but stopped me at the door?" Titus interjected forcefully, "I need an explanation, Your Highness! Please bring my daughter out to see me!"

What kind of rhythm was this? Roland was taken aback. In the scene he had envisioned, the other party would have learned that his daughter had unfortunately become a witch and would either humbly beg him to conceal the news or simply let him handle the problem. But he had not expected this aggressive approach from Pine, who completely disregarded noble etiquette.



As for why the guards let Nana in, it was entirely due to his own instructions. She came to find Anna every other day, and the guards were familiar with her.

After pondering for a moment, Roland summoned a maid and had her bring Nana over.

Regardless of how rude the other party was, he was still Nana's father, and it was better to let the two meet before discussing further. If he showed the slightest intention of handing the little girl over to the Church or abandoning her, there would still be time to take measures.

Nana came out with Anna.

The moment he saw his daughter, the impatience in Titus Pine's eyes vanished. He opened his arms and called out to Nana, "Come to Daddy."

But the little girl just hid behind Anna, revealing half of her head, "Will you sell me to the Church?"

"Cough... What are you talking about, silly child? The Church wouldn't want a fool like you. Come home with me."

This reaction puzzled Roland. According to Nightingale, Nana was seen by her father using her magic and had fled to the castle in panic to find Anna, with her father chasing after her in a murderous rage.

But now, the look in Titus's eyes when he saw his daughter was only one of care and indulgence, nothing like the common hatred for witches.



Did I misunderstand something?



Roland hesitated for a moment, then decided to lay things out in the open. "Mr. Pine, your daughter is a witch, I'm sure you've realized that by now."



"What are you talking about, Your Highness? I don't understand," Titus stomped his foot, stepping forward to try and grab Nana's hand, but Anna moved to the side and blocked him.



"Father, I've become a witch... I'm sorry," Nana said softly.



Titus finally became a bit anxious. "Nonsense! What witch? It must be that Karl fellow's teachings, I knew I shouldn't have let you go to his academy, all that church nonsense is bullshit!"



Hearing this, Roland suddenly understood something—it seemed that the man's actions, trying to cover up for Nana in every possible way, were because he had misunderstood him?



That's why he had been so anxious and restless before seeing his daughter.



"Anna," he winked at the witch, who nodded in response. As Titus tried to bypass her to pull Nana away, Anna extended her right hand. Flames burst from her palm, skimming over his head.



Titus's eyes widened, and he stumbled backward in panic, while Nana also clung to Anna's arm in fright, "Sister Anna, no!"



"Your Highness, this is—!" 



"As you can see, she is also a witch, just like your daughter," Roland spread his hands, "The reason Nana can freely enter and leave the castle is not what you think. Can we have a proper talk now?"



It was only then that Titus seemed to wake up from a dream, uttering "Ah" twice, "Your Highness, I..."



"Sit down and talk," Roland pointed to the table, "Have a cup of tea first."



Just as I thought, he sighed internally, is my reputation really that bad, so bad that even children are not spared? Roland now fully understood the other party's initial impolite behavior; a father concerned about his daughter would see her running into the lord's castle, while the guards act as if it's nothing unusual—what does that imply?



If it were himself, he might have had the urge to tear down the castle with his bare hands.



As for the persistent denial that his daughter was a witch, the intention was even more obvious—Titus was worried that the prince would threaten him with the argument that "Nana has fallen and needs to be purified," whereas he himself didn't care at all whether his precious daughter was a witch.



Titus hesitated for a long time, but finally sat down with a plop, picked up the teacup, gulped it down, wiped his mouth, and looked somewhat embarrassed, "I apologize, it was rude of me. May I ask when you found out my daughter became a, uh... witch?"



"Before winter began. The first to discover her awakening was not me, but her teacher, Karl Barton. Because of his friendship with Anna, he entrusted Nana to me, hoping I could give her protection," Roland explained in detail, "And for the past one and a half months, she has been coming to the castle to practice her abilities whenever she has the time. By the way, your daughter's ability is healing."



"Is that so..." Titus scratched his head. "I was wondering how that cat suddenly started running and jumping."



"Cat?"



"Cough cough, it's nothing much. I was on my way home when I saw this child sitting at the doorstep holding a cat that had been hit by a carriage. I was planning to sneak up behind her to give her a scare, but when she saw me, she ran off, and so did the cat, even though it clearly had a broken leg," he glanced at Nana and Anna, "Are you friends?"



Anna had yet to express her stance, but Nana's head was already nodding vigorously.



Titus's expression softened a bit.



Seeing this, Roland asked, "You don't seem to think of witches as evil beings seduced by the devil."



"My daughter is certainly not an evil being!" he declared emphatically. "No matter what she has become, there's no doubt about that!"



He was so different from Anna's father, Roland couldn't help but reflect; he now understood why Nana always seemed carefree, with a constant smile on her face. Such a family was like a warm cradle for a child.



"I don't think so either, Mr. Pine," the prince said bluntly. "Your daughter's ability is of extraordinary significance to the injured. I hope she can stay in Border Town, to assist me in combating the Evil Months."



Titus hesitated, "Your Highness, please forgive my refusal, but when the Evil Months come, this place will become very dangerous, and I cannot leave her in the town."



Titus Pine's fief was not under the jurisdiction of Border Town, so even as a prince, Roland could not directly command him. However, as long as he was willing to sit down and talk, Roland thought, there would be no fear of not being able to persuade him.
