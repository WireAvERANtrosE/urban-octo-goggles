## The Border Town Defense Battle (Part 1)
As the enemy appeared in the distance, Tanner saw those fully armed knights, riding tall horses, clad in shining armor, slowly approaching the town. Usually, a single knight in the town was a figure of authority, and now nearly a hundred of them appeared at once, a sight that made him gasp.



Tanner felt the sweat in his palms again, just like when he first faced the demonic beasts on the city walls. But this time, he was facing his own kind—the noble coalition from Longsong Stronghold.



No, he spat, casting his thoughts aside. His own kind? When had those nobles ever considered him one of their own? He thought with self-mockery. They had come to seize Border Town and bring the Northern Slope Mine back under the control of the stronghold. What's more, they were planning to drive His Highness the Prince out of the Western Territory, something that the First Army could not accept at all.



His Highness had made it very clear in the pre-war speech yesterday. Timothy Wimbledon, His Highness' brother, had used plots and schemes to usurp the throne, causing the death of the old King Wimbledon III. Tanner didn't usually have much opinion about the affairs between the royal family and the nobility—who cared which king was in charge? But for the Duke of Lion to take advantage of the situation and try to take away His Highness' territory was too much.



Just think, what was Border Town like before His Highness arrived? The previous lord seemed to be an earl, rarely seen, and would always come with his guards when buying furs, often forcibly buying good goods from hunters at low prices. He was the first to flee when the Evil Months came, and when the townspeople suffered in the slums of the stronghold, he never inquired.



Now, under the governance of His Highness the Prince, Border Town was getting better and better, changes that everyone could see. Tanner thought, the more the miners produced, the more they earned. After His Highness introduced that black machine into the Northern Slope Mine, the extra output still counted towards the miners' credit. Whether it was building walls or crushing stones in the mines, the people's compensation was always paid on time. This winter, not a single person starved or froze to death.



Of course, the biggest change was the militia—no, the current First Army. With them guarding the town, no one had to huddle in the cold wooden shacks of the stronghold during winter, begging those important figures for a morsel of food. If His Highness the Prince were no longer there, would the Duke still allow the First Army to exist?



Tanner took a deep breath and wiped the sweat from his hands onto his clothes. Of course, they wouldn't allow it. The nobles of the stronghold didn't care about the lives of the townspeople, which was exactly what His Highness had said: Only an army composed of the people will be willing to fight for the people.



He looked up to the left side of the sky, where a small black dot was circling. At a casual glance, one might think it was just a large-headed bird. That was the firing command for the artillery team—Lightning. She used the cover of the trees on both sides of the road, observing the enemy from a high vantage point. When she flew back, Tanner also noticed that as long as she didn't voluntarily go to the open area, those looking up from below could only see the branches on both sides, making it difficult to spot the witch scouting from above.



Lightning had once flown close to the front line in a quarter of an hour, flashing the green ribbon.

That meant the enemy had entered the one-thousand-meter range for preparatory firing. Tanner was still not clear how far exactly "one thousand meters" was, but upon seeing the green signal, he subconsciously gave the commands to load and adjust the firing angle according to the regulations of the comprehensive drill.

The four artillery teams quickly completed these actions; the angle of the gun barrels was adjusted to the third notch, and both gunpowder and solid shot had been loaded into the bore.

He had thought that having stood on the city walls and confronted the demonic beasts meant he was experienced, but Tanner realized today that he was still far behind Iron Axe and Brian. When the troops were arrayed this afternoon, his heart rate had been hard to stabilize. Yet these two, leading their respective groups into firing positions, not only looked calm, but he could even detect a hint of eagerness in Brian's shouting. Up to now, he himself had still not regained his composure, even the Rodney brothers seemed to be performing better than him. This made Tanner feel somewhat dejected.

He licked his dry lips, looking again for Lightning's position.

At that moment, the enemy's advance suddenly slowed down considerably.

"What are they doing?" Rodney asked.

"I'm not sure," Moe said, his eyes widened as he looked around, "It seems like they're adjusting their formation? Their ranks seem a bit disordered."

"They're waiting for the troops behind them," Jop's voice trembled slightly, "The knights surely wouldn't operate alone, there must be a large force following them."



"You know all this?" Nelson curled his lips in disdain.

"I've seen it! A knight lord would at least bring two followers, and a dozen serfs to carry their grain and fodder," he counted on his fingers, "Look, a stronghold duke, he has at least a hundred knights under his command, right? Just those who can fight on horseback are at least three hundred. Plus the counts and viscounts in his domain... even more! And then there are the mercenaries, they do the bloodiest work, killing without even blinking an eye! And we have only three hundred men in total."



Less than three hundred, Tanner corrected in his mind. The gun squad had only a bit more than two hundred seventy men armed, which according to His Highness was due to insufficient production capacity. Now those without guns had been assigned to the artillery team, moving ammunition for the four cannons. However, seeing others performing worse than him made him feel a bit better.



"It's the mercenaries, they are coming!" Jop whispered loudly.



Tanner looked up to see a motley crew gradually taking over the front of the battlefield. They were neither on horseback nor in formation, but rather gathering in twos and threes toward the center. The knights spread out to the sides, as if to make room for the mercenaries. Compared to half an hour ago, the duke's allied forces had gotten much closer.



At that moment, a knight dashed out from the allied forces, heading swiftly towards Border Town. Tanner's heart tightened, and he almost shouted the firing command.



What's he up to? He looked up, still no sign of Lightning, and the rider was getting closer, waving a white flag.



"He's an envoy sent by the duke," Jop muttered, "Probably here to persuade us to surrender."



"That's none of our business," Rodney squatted behind the cannon, aligning his sight with the barrel's centerline. "Squad leader, the cannon needs adjusting, most of the knights have left the center."



During the live-fire exercises before, they had been repeatedly taught that the attack range of the cannon was right along the straight line in front of the muzzle. Therefore, to hit the target, it was necessary to make the target overlap with the centerline of the barrel. All five men slightly rotated the gun carriage together until they brought the vanguard knight troops of the allied forces back into the direction the cannon was pointing.



The envoy who had come alone was immediately taken into custody behind the defense line by Lord Carter. However, Tanner knew that the Duke's move was just a waste of time, as His Highness the Prince would never agree to surrender.



Suddenly, Lightning accelerated towards the town's defensive line, her arms waving, with the yellow ribbon in her hand fluttering in the wind.



—The yellow signal indicated that the enemy had entered within an 800-meter range. Within this distance, the cannon's solid shot had a chance of hitting the target. As long as the artillery captain did not signal to cease fire, each artillery crew was free to fire at will.



The crew members also noticed this signal, all of them turning their gaze towards Tanner, who nodded, took a deep breath, and commanded, "Fire!"
