## Border Town Defense Battle (Part 1)
When the enemy appeared in the distance, Vanner saw the fully armed knights, riding high horses and clad in shining armor, slowly approaching the town. Normally, the presence of a single knight in the town was a lofty existence, but now, nearly a hundred of them appeared all at once, a sight that made him gasp in shock.



Vanner felt his palms sweating again, just like when he first faced the demonic beasts standing on the city walls. But this time, he was facing his own kind—the noble coalition from Longsong Stronghold.



No, he spat out, casting his thoughts aside. His own kind? When had those nobles ever considered him one of them? He thought with self-derision. They had come to seize Border Town, to bring the North Slope Mine back under the stronghold's control. What was more, they even planned to drive His Highness, the prince, out of the Western Territory. This was something that the entire First Army could not accept.



His Highness had made it very clear in his speech before the battle yesterday. Timothy Wimbledon, His Highness's brother, had used schemes and plots to seize the throne, leading to the death of the old King Wimbledon III. Normally, Vanner didn’t care much about these royal and noble affairs—whoever became the king didn't really matter, did it? But for Duke Ryan to take this opportunity to seize His Highness's territory was going too far.



Just think about it. What was Border Town like before His Highness arrived? The former lord seemed to be an earl, rarely seen around, always accompanied by his personal guards when buying furs, often forcing hunters to sell their good catches at low prices. He was the first to flee when the Evil Months came, and he never inquired about the suffering of the townspeople in the stronghold's slums.



Now, under the governance of His Highness, Border Town had only gotten better, and these changes were visible to all. Vanner thought about how the miners were getting paid more for producing more. After His Highness introduced that black machine into the North Slope Mine, the extra output was still credited to the miners. Whether it was building the city wall or crushing stones in the mines, the villagers were paid on time. This winter, not a single person starved or froze to death.



Of course, the biggest change was the militia—no, the now First Army. With them guarding the town, everyone no longer had to curl up in the cold wooden shacks of the stronghold during winter, begging the nobles for a bite to eat. If His Highness was no longer there, would the Duke still allow the First Army to exist?



Vanner took a deep breath and wiped his sweaty hands on his clothes. Of course, they would not allow it. The nobles of the stronghold did not care about the life and death of the townspeople. That was exactly what His Highness had said: only an army made up of the people would be willing to fight for the people.



He looked up at the sky to the left, where a small black dot circled in the distance. At a casual glance, one might think it was just a large-headed bird. That was the artillery team's firing commander—Lightning. She used the trees on both sides of the road as cover, observing the enemy's movements from a high vantage point. When she flew back, Vanner also noticed that as long as she didn't actively go to open ground, people looking up would only see the branches on both sides, making it very difficult to detect the witch scouting from the sky.



Lightning had once flown to a position closer to the front in a quarter of an hour, showing off a green ribbon.

That signaled that the enemy had entered the thousand-meter range for preliminary firing. Vanner was still unclear about how far exactly "a thousand meters" was as mentioned by His Highness, but seeing the green signal, he subconsciously shouted the commands to load and adjust the firing angle according to the standards of the comprehensive drills.

The four artillery crews quickly completed this set of actions, adjusting the firing angle of the cannons to the third notch, with gunpowder and solid cannonballs already loaded into the chambers.

He had thought that standing on the city walls and confronting the demonic beasts would count as being experienced, but it was only today that Vanner realized he was still far behind Iron Axe and Brian. His heartbeat had been hard to settle down since the formation in the afternoon. Yet these two, leading their groups into firing positions, not only appeared calm, but he could even detect a hint of eagerness in Brian's shouting. Until now, he still hadn't regained his composure, even the Rodney brothers seemed to be performing better than him, which was somewhat disheartening.

He licked his dry lips and searched for Lightning's position again.

It was at this moment that the enemy's advance suddenly slowed down a lot.

"What are they doing?" Rodney asked.

"I'm not sure," Cat's Claw squinted, peering out, "It seems like they're adjusting their formation? Their ranks look a bit disordered."

"They are waiting for the troops behind," Pine said with a tremor in his voice, "The knight lord would not fight alone, there must be a large number of troops following them."



"Do you know all this?" Nelson curled his lip.



"I've seen it! A knight lord brings at least two followers, with over a dozen serfs to carry their food and fodder," he counted on his fingers, "Look, a duke in charge of a fortress would have at least a hundred knights, right? Just those who can fight on horseback, that's at least three hundred. Plus the counts and viscounts in his domain... even more! And the mercenaries, they live by the sword, killing without blinking an eye! We have only three hundred in total."



Less than three hundred, Vanner corrected in his mind. The gun squad was equipped with just over two hundred seventy weapons, due to which His Highness called a shortage of production capacity. Those without muskets were now assigned to the artillery team, carrying ammunition for the four cannons. However, seeing others perform worse than himself made him feel a bit better.



"Those are the mercenaries, they're coming!" Citrus whispered urgently.



Vanner looked up and saw a group of oddly dressed fellows gradually taking over the front of the battlefield. They weren't on horseback, nor were they in formation, but instead gathered in the center in twos and threes. The knights spread out to the sides, seemingly making room for the mercenaries. Compared to half an hour ago, the Duke's allied forces were much closer.



At that moment, a knight sped out from the allied forces, heading quickly towards Border Town. Vanner's heart tightened, almost shouting the order to fire.



What is this about? He looked up, still not seeing Lightning, while the other side was getting closer, waving a white flag.



"He's an envoy sent by the duke," Citrus muttered, "Probably here to offer surrender terms."



"That's not our concern," Rodney crouched behind the cannon, aligning his sight along the barrel's centerline, "Squad Leader, the cannon needs to be adjusted, most of the knights have left the center of the field."



During the previous live ammunition drills, they had been repeatedly taught that the firing range of the cannon was directly in front of the muzzle in a straight line, so to hit the target, they had to align the target with the central axis of the cannon barrel. The five-man crew adjusted the gun carriage slightly until they once again had the vanguard of the allied knights within the direction of the cannon's aim.



The lone messenger was immediately taken into custody by Lord Carter behind the defensive line, but Vanner knew that the Duke's actions were merely a waste of time, as His Highness would never agree to surrender.



Suddenly, Lightning accelerated towards the town's defenses, her arms waving, with the yellow ribbon in her hand fluttering in the wind.



—The yellow signal indicated that the enemy had entered within an eight hundred meter range, a distance at which the cannon's solid shot had a chance of hitting the target. As long as the artillery captain did not signal to cease fire, each gun crew could fire at will.



The crew members also noticed the signal, and they all turned their gaze to Vanner, who nodded, took a deep breath, and commanded, "Fire!"
