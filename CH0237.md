## Invitation
Returning to the office, Roland immediately began the design work for the new machinery.



During the days when the First Army and the witches went to the King's City, he was far from idle; on the contrary, Roland felt busier than before. Even without Nightingale by his side, his alone time with Anna was scant. Apart from settling the boats of refugees, he also had Anna work with Lucia to test the composition of smelting products and build new smelters.



Whether it was iron or steel smelting in the past, it was purely based on experience and feeling, with no knowledge of the exact components of the resulting materials. Now, with Lucia's help, Roland finally had a method to accurately determine the composition of metal ingots. Leveraging her ability to decompose materials, he could obtain detailed data necessary for smelting by repeated comparisons, such as the stirring time after melting, the precise amount of charcoal to add, whether to mix in limestone or other additives to remove sulfur and phosphorus, or to blend in other metal materials to obtain alloys, and so on...



Based on these data, Roland could then establish standardized processes for the smelting industry, producing iron ingots or steel of the same quality in multiple productions, and gradually dispelling the fog of uncertainty in material science.



The new smelter was built for this purpose.



It was a rectangular furnace, four meters long and two meters tall, with a sloping bottom towards one end. The thick outer shell was made of cast iron, covered with clay bricks on the inside, along with Sorya's 'earth' coating, which had excellent heat resistance. The lowest end featured a movable gate, pulled by a steam engine. Considering the high-end heating methods such as oxygen blowing and electric arc, none of which were feasible, the furnace was simply designed without any combustion devices—it relied entirely on Anna's Blackfire to smelt the molten steel. After adding the raw materials in the tested proportions and completing the smelting, the molten steel would be directly discharged from the gate at the tail end.



This furnace could produce about fifty tons of molten steel at a time, and Anna could complete the smelting in just a quarter of an hour. Including the time for feeding materials and discharging steel, it took only about half an hour, and the output was basically enough to meet the current production of firearms and cannons. The smelting model of the town now was that the cluster of blast furnaces and vertical furnaces produced a large amount of pig iron, which could be used for everyday ironware and steam engine manufacturing, and could also be further smelted in iron furnaces to produce wrought iron or steel.

The design drawings that Roland was currently sketching were for a set of production equipment for bullet stamping—with a stable and reliable source of steel, the machining and assembly of stamping machinery no longer posed a hardware challenge. The successful trial production of mercury fulminate made the mass production of new-style bullets urgent. While Anna's Blackfire cutting was efficient and precise, it would still take a long time for one person to complete the entire process. If the stamping machine assembly line was put into production, more than thirty ordinary people could operate it after training, producing at least ten thousand bullets a day, and soldiers would no longer need to manually reload ammunition.



After dinner, I drew for a long time until the midnight bell rang from outside the window. Only then did the complete set of sketches begin to take shape. Of course, this is just the most preliminary concept design; some details I'm not sure whether they are feasible or not and will require testing before they can be finalized.



Normally, Roland would already be yawning incessantly by now, but today he was in high spirits and not the least bit sleepy.



He gathered the dozen or so draft papers, took out the parchment that came with Princess Tilly's letter from the drawer, and spread it out on the table. He finally reached the long-awaited step—selecting the visiting witches.



The list roughly outlined the abilities of over sixty support-type witches. From what Maggie had said, the total number of witches on Sleeping Island should be between two hundred and three hundred. Obviously, Tilly had not listed the abilities of all the support witches on the table. This was also in line with the actions of a leader—extending a hand of friendship without laying all her cards on the table. The fact that the other party could do this was enough to express the sincerity of wanting to form an alliance. Roland changed to a new candle and focused on reviewing the abilities of the witches in the appendix.



It must be said, this was a very difficult decision to make. After multiple comparisons, he finally selected a list of five visitors.



Then Roland spread out a piece of parchment and began writing a reply.



"Dear sister, I am delighted to see your letter."



"I am very excited and reassured by the decision you've made. With your assistance, I am now more confident in holding off the church's attack."



"The trust and support of the witches that I have been able to obtain is also due to this—on the entire continent of Greycastle, only Border Town has completely erased the influence of the church. The locals not only accept the witches but even fight alongside them, from resisting the demonic beasts to confronting the church. My subjects and the witches have formed an inseparable whole. Now, all over the town, you can see them participating in construction. The curious steam engine you mentioned was also realized with the help of witches. This is a good sign, and what I need to do is to promote this situation throughout the entire Western Region, until the entire kingdom."



"For this purpose, I must destroy the entire Church, dispel the notion that witches are evil, and rescue all people from their folly and ignorance. It is a lengthy process, and I need more of your assistance."



"As to what has made me come to this decision, and what has made me stop being indifferent to everything as I was in the past, those are trivial details that can be discussed at leisure when the opportunity arises. Given the limited space on paper, I will not elaborate further."



"Regarding the witches' visit next month, I am very much looking forward to it. Please have no worries about their safety, as I have planned a direct route to Border Town that completely avoids the eyes and ears of the Church, without the need to use any port. The only risk lies in the voyage, but I think with Maggie leading the way, the possibility of the ships getting lost is exceedingly slim. I will attach the specific route to a map and send it to Sleeping Island along with Maggie."



"After these witches arrive in Border Town, they will naturally be able to participate in the foundational knowledge courses—what is called the knowledge that facilitates the evolution of witch abilities. I am more inclined to believe that it is the deepened understanding of the world that has led to their transformation, whether it is in regard to nature, magic, or their own selves. Undoubtedly, with each additional witch whose abilities evolve, we gain a better chance of victory against the Church, and on this point, my views are entirely in agreement with yours."



"Lastly, I have listed the names of the five selected witches below, hoping to see them soon."



"Terrain Sculptor—Lotus."



"Status Sustainer—Candle."



"Brewer—Evelyn."



"Beast Tamer—Honey."



"And the Eye of Truth—Sylvie."

"Then, I wish you all the best. Your brother, Roland Wimbledon."
