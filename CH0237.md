## Invitation
Returning to his office, Roland immediately began the drawing work for the new machinery.



During the days when the First Army and the witches headed to the King's City, he was far from idle; on the contrary, Roland felt that he was even busier than usual. Even without Nightingale by his side, the time he spent alone with Anna was scarce. In addition to arranging for the refugees who arrived by boat, he had Anna and Lucia test the composition of the smelting products and build new smelting furnaces.



In the past, both iron and steel smelting relied solely on experience and feeling, with no knowledge of the actual composition of the resulting product. Now, with Lucia's help, Roland finally had a precise method to determine the composition of metal ingots. Utilizing the ability to decompose materials, he could obtain detailed data for smelting by repeated comparison, such as stirring time after melting, the specific amount of charcoal to be added, and whether to mix in limestone or other additives to remove sulfur and phosphorus, or to mix in other metal materials to obtain alloys, and so on...



Based on these data, Roland could establish standardized smelting processes to produce iron ingots or steel of the same quality in multiple productions, while also gradually dispelling the fog of material science.



The new type of smelting furnace was built for this purpose.



It was a four-meter-long, two-meter-high square furnace with a sloping bottom toward one end. The thick exterior was cast iron, with an inner layer covered with clay bricks, as well as a coating of Soria's "Mud," which had excellent heat resistance. At the lower end, there was a movable gate, pulled by a steam engine. Considering those sophisticated heating methods, such as oxygen blowing and electric arc, none of which were feasible, the furnace was simply not equipped with any combustion device—it relied entirely on Anna's Blackfire to smelt the molten steel. After adding raw materials and completing the smelting according to the tested proportions, the molten steel would be directly discharged through the tailgate.



The furnace could produce about fifty tons of molten steel at a time, and Anna could complete the melting in just a quarter of an hour. Including the time for feeding and tapping, it took only about half an hour, and the output was basically enough to meet the current production of firearms and cannons. The smelting model of the town now was that the blast furnaces and shaft furnaces of the furnace cluster were responsible for producing a large amount of pig iron, which could be used for daily ironware and steam engine manufacturing, and could also be further smelted in iron furnaces to produce wrought iron or steel.

The design that Roland was currently drawing was a set of production equipment for bullet stamping—with a stable and reliable source of steel, the machining and assembly of stamping machinery no longer posed a hardware challenge, and the successful trial production of mercury fulminate made the mass production of new bullets urgent. Although Anna's Blackfire cutting was efficient and accurate, it would still take a long time for one person to complete the full set of processes. If the stamping machine production line was put into operation, more than thirty ordinary people could operate it after training, producing at least tens of thousands of bullets a day, and soldiers would no longer need to manually reload ammunition.



After dinner, he continued drawing for a long time, until the midnight bells rang outside the window. Only then did the full set of sketches start to take shape. Of course, this was just the initial concept design; some details he wasn't sure would work, and they would need to be tested before they could be finalized.



Usually, Roland would have been yawning endlessly by now, but today he was in high spirits and not the least bit sleepy.



After organizing the dozen or so draft papers, he took out the sheepskin parchment attached in Princess Tilly's letter from the drawer and spread it out on the table. He had finally reached the long-awaited step—selecting the visiting witches.



The list detailed the abilities of about sixty support-type witches. According to Maggie, the total number of witches on Sleeping Island should be around two to three hundred. Clearly, Tilly had not included the abilities of all the support witches on the list. This was consistent with the approach of a leader—extending a hand of friendship, rather than laying all her cards on the table. The fact that the other party had done this much was sufficient to express the sincerity of wanting to form an alliance. Roland changed the candle and concentrated on examining the appendix for the witches' abilities.



It had to be said that this was a very difficult decision to make, and after much comparison, he finally selected the names of five visitors.



Then, Roland spread out a piece of sheepskin parchment and began writing a reply.



"Dear sister, I am delighted to see your letter."



"I am greatly encouraged and reassured by the decision you have made. With your assistance, I am more confident in our ability to hold off the Church's attacks."



"The trust and support I have received from the witches also lies in this—across the entire continent of Greycastle, only Border Town has completely eradicated the Church's influence. The natives not only accept the witches, but even fight alongside them, from resisting demonic beasts to confronting the Church. My subjects and the witches have formed an inseparable whole. Now, the town is filled with their presence, contributing to its construction. The steam engine that piqued your curiosity was also realized with the help of the witches. This is a positive sign, and what I intend to do is to promote this situation throughout the entire Western Region, until it encompasses the whole kingdom."



"For this, I must destroy the entire Church, turn the claim that witches are evil to dust, and rescue all people from folly and ignorance. This is a lengthy process, and I need more of your assistance."



"As for what made me make this decision, what made me stop being indifferent to everything as before, I can explain these trivial matters in detail when there's a chance. There's limited space on paper, so I won't elaborate further."



"I am very much looking forward to the witches' visit next month. Please don't worry about their safety; I have planned a direct route to Border Town for them, which completely avoids the eyes and ears of the Church and does not require the use of any port. The only risk is during navigation, but I think with Maggie leading the way, the likelihood of the ships getting lost is slim to none. I will include a map detailing the route, which will be sent to Sleeping Island along with Maggie."



"After these witches arrive at Border Town, they will naturally participate in the basic knowledge classes—the so-called knowledge that promotes the evolution of a witch's abilities. I am more inclined to think that a deeper understanding of the world leads to their transformation: this includes understanding of nature, magic, and themselves. Without a doubt, for every witch whose abilities evolve, we gain a better chance in our fight against the Church, and on this point, my view is completely aligned with yours."



"Lastly, I have listed the names of the five selected witches below, hoping to see them soon."



"Terrain Sculpting—Lotus."



"Status Preservation—Candle."



"Brewer—Evelyn."



"Beast Tamer—Honey."



"as well as the Eye of True Sight—Sylvie."

"Then, I wish you all the best. Your brother, Roland Wimbledon."
