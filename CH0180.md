## Population Census
Roland recently immersed himself in a pleasant mood.

Even when sitting alone in the office, he would hum a tune or two from time to time, while reminiscing about the good times in the hot air balloon basket.

Anna's appearance as she closed her eyes and sought a kiss was simply too adorable, and just thinking about it made him unable to resist curling the corners of his mouth. What was more important was the meaning behind her words, which had undoubtedly revealed her fervent emotions.

All he could do at that moment was to respond to her even more passionately.

So much so that when they landed, Roland felt a faint pain in his lips.

Was it because the kiss had been too long and she had trouble breathing, causing her to use her teeth in her panic?

Regardless, it was a sensation he hadn't experienced in a long time.

When life was approaching a quarter of its span, all those techniques gleaned from TV shows, movies, novels, and comics finally had a chance to be put to use, and the object of his actions was the beautiful and captivating Miss Anna. Roland felt that he had finally taken the first step of a winner in life.

Taking a satisfied breath, he reached his hand into the drawer, wanting to chew on some snacks to soothe his joy, only to come up empty-handed—the beef jerky had clearly been put there just yesterday.



Roland turned his head to glance at Nightingale, who was lying by the window. She whistled casually, feigning an indifferent appreciation of the scenery. He had deliberately replaced the dried fish with beef jerky to prevent Nightingale from sneaking some, but it seemed she was not averse to beef jerky either?



Just then, footsteps sounded outside the door.



"Your Highness, Sir Barov requests an audience."



"Let him in."



Nightingale didn't disappear as she usually did but instead pulled down her hood and returned to the recliner by the wall to sit down.



The Minister Assistant pushed the door open and entered, pausing briefly in surprise at the sight of another person in the office, but he quickly regained his composure.



"Your Highness, this month's population census has been compiled," he said, handing over a scroll of parchment.



"That was quick?"



"With the citizen registration files, it's much easier to conduct the census now," the Minister Assistant said with a smile, "Your earlier decision was truly a stroke of wisdom."



Uh, now they have even started to flatter... Roland spread out the scroll, which clearly categorized the population of Border Town according to their different occupations. Compared to the reports that didn't even have paragraphs when he first arrived, Barov's capabilities had indeed greatly improved.



The first line, which also had the largest number of people, was the serfs, totaling three thousand six hundred and twenty-eight people (including families). Below that was a note: The number of serfs engaged in farming was one thousand five hundred.



"Your Highness, isn't the number of people engaged in farming a bit too small?" Barov pointed to the first item and said, "According to Sonny of the Ministry of Agriculture's estimate, in order to stop importing food for the town, we would need to double the current farmland and manpower to meet Border Town's food needs."



Roland had some impression of the name Sonny; he should be a knight from the Wolfheart family. The one thousand five hundred people engaged in farming were the initial batch of serfs sent here, and the subsequent groups had been reassigned by Roland to the mines or Karl's construction team—they had also been given the same assurance that after working for a certain period of time, they could be promoted to freemen.



"I don't intend to achieve food self-sufficiency this year. Currently, there is still a lot of wheat stored in the castle's warehouse, enough to last two or three months. Moreover, the wheat that was newly planted this year is also quite different."



"Different?" Barov was taken aback.



"Uh-huh, you'll know when the time comes," Roland smiled. That was the improved Golden No. 1 wheat, with a per plant yield at least three times higher than ordinary wheat. Come harvest time, it will certainly surprise everyone. This was also the reason he did not want to put too many people into agriculture. With Leaf's magically-modified crops, in the future, only a few farmers would be needed to feed the majority of the subjects, thus saving valuable human resources for industrial development and urban construction.



He continued to read on.



The second line on the parchment listed construction personnel, with a complicated array of notes below, including stonemasons, tilers, plasterers, carpenters, laborers, and so on. The total number was over one thousand one hundred people, most of whom were serfs serving as laborers. It was also because of the addition of this new workforce that Border Town was able to quickly build a batch of residential areas and factories—modularizing, mass-producing, and systematizing construction were important means to speed up the progress. Although in Roland's eyes, this speed was still not enough, for the locals, it was already considered shockingly unconventional.



The third row is for the mining personnel.

Similar to the construction industry, the number of local residents in Border Town has decreased to twenty-five, mainly responsible for operating steam engines, mine registration, and management. The remaining one thousand six hundred are outsiders, including the mercenaries captured during the battle at Longsong Stronghold and the serfs sent subsequently.



"Several brawls have occurred in the mining area recently," Barov said, "mainly conflicts between mercenaries and serfs. This is a hidden danger, Your Highness. There are too many of them, and once a riot starts, the twenty-five managers alone cannot control it. I suggest that the First Army take responsibility for assisting in the oversight."



"Hmm..." Roland pondered for a moment, "Let's do that. We are currently short-handed and unable to form a police force. I will talk to Iron Axe about it; a musket team of about fifty people should be enough."



"Police... what is that?"



"You can think of it as a patrol team, but with a much larger jurisdiction. They are basically in charge of maintaining internal security." In this era, there was no distinction between internal and external violence, so having the military take over public security would not become a dark chapter in his history. Before dealing with the Church, this huge enemy, he did not intend to divert manpower to build a second apparatus for violence.



Ranked fourth is the First Army of Border Town.



After the end of the battle at the Stronghold, the First Army's reputation spread throughout the Western Territory—three hundred men defeated a fifteen hundred strong duke's coalition army with minimal casualties, causing the nobles of the Stronghold to lose their courage to resist. After rewarding the meritorious, Roland expanded the First Army to double its size, increasing it to six hundred men. The recruitment notice had just been issued when the town square was filled with eager applicants. Roland, still adhering to the principle that the people's army should be composed of the people, selected three hundred individuals with decent qualifications and no criminal records from the original residents to join the First Army.



The rest are various technical personnel.



For instance, in the smelting and firing industries, there has been a substantial increase in the number of people over the past month, growing from the initial twenty-some individuals to around four hundred. Thanks to the "Furnace Expert" Lucia, the North Slope kiln cluster can now not only produce red bricks but also manufacture cement and glass. At the same time, three blast furnaces are being constructed, and before long, the ore piled in the yard can go through an initial melting in these blast furnaces, be cast into ingots, and then be transported to where they are needed.



As for education, chemistry, industry, and animal husbandry, all combined still account for less than fifty people. Therefore, purely from a demographic standpoint, Border Town still has a long road ahead. However, the fact that a small town originally composed mainly of hunters and miners has transformed to this extent in half a year can be described as a complete overhaul.



Today, hunters have all but disappeared, with hunting shifting from a survival necessity to a hobby. Excluding those who have joined the First Army or the smelting industry, there are still nearly a thousand people in the town who are unemployed. Once the literacy component of the universal education program is complete, Roland has decided to pull all these citizens into the factories, marking the start of industrial production.
