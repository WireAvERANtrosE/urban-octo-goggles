## Population Census
Roland has recently been immersed in a pleasant mood.

Even when sitting alone in his office, he would hum a tune or two from time to time, while reminiscing about the wonderful times in the hot air balloon basket.

The way Anna closed her eyes and asked for a kiss was just too adorable, and the mere thought of it could make him involuntarily grin. Moreover, the most important thing was the meaning behind her words, which had undoubtedly revealed her passionate feelings.

The only thing he could do at that moment was to respond to her with even more fervor.

So much so that when they landed, Roland felt a faint pain in his lips.

Perhaps it was the overly prolonged kiss that made her breathing difficult, and in her panic, she had used her teeth?

Regardless, it was a sensation he hadn't experienced in a long time.

When one's life approaches a quarter of a century, those skills learned from TV, movies, novels, and comics finally have a place to be put to use, and the fact that his partner was the stunningly beautiful Miss Anna made Roland feel as though he had finally taken the first step of a winner in life.

Satisfied, he took a deep breath, reached into his drawer for some snacks to soothe his joy, only to find it empty—the beef jerky had just been placed there yesterday.



Roland turned his head to glance at Nightingale, who was lying by the window. She whistled nonchalantly, pretending to be engrossed in the scenery. He had deliberately switched the dried fish for beef jerky to prevent Nightingale from snatching it, but it turned out she was just as eager for the beef jerky?



Just then, footsteps sounded outside the door.



"Your Highness, Sir Barov requests an audience."



"Let him in."



Nightingale did not vanish as she usually did but instead pulled down her hood and returned to her lounge chair by the wall.



The Minister's assistant entered the office and paused briefly upon seeing someone else there, but quickly regained his composure.



"Your Highness, the population census for this month has been compiled," he said, handing over a scroll of parchment.



"So soon?"



"With the citizen registration records, it's much easier to do the census now," the Minister's assistant said with a smile. "Your earlier decision was truly wise."



"Hmm, now they even start to flatter me..." Roland unfolded the scroll, which clearly categorized the population of Border Town by occupation. Compared to the reports that didn't even separate paragraphs when he first arrived, Barov’s ability had indeed greatly improved.



The first line, which also had the highest number of people, was serfs, totaling three thousand six hundred and twenty-eight people (including family members). There was a note below: The serfs engaged in farming numbered one thousand five hundred.



"Your Highness, isn't the population engaged in farming a bit too small?" Barov pointed to the first item and said, "According to the estimate by the Ministry of Agriculture's Sini Eri, in order to make the town no longer import food, we probably need to double the farmland and manpower to meet the food needs of Border Town."



Roland had some impression of the name Sini; he must be a knight from the Swift Wolf family. The one thousand five hundred people engaged in farming were the initial batch of serfs sent over, and the subsequent batches had been reassigned by Roland to the mines or Karl's construction team—they had also been given the same promise that as long as they worked for a certain period, they could be promoted to freemen.



"I don't intend to achieve self-sufficiency in food this year. There is still a lot of wheat stored in the castle's warehouse, enough for two or three months of consumption. Moreover, the wheat that was newly planted this year is also quite different."



"Different?" Barov was stunned.



"Yes, you'll see." Roland smiled. That was Leaf's improved Golden One wheat, with a yield at least three times higher than ordinary wheat per plant. When the harvest came, it would surely surprise everyone. This was also the reason he did not want to employ too many people in agriculture. With Leaf's magically modified crops, in the future, only a few farmers would be needed to feed most of the people, thus saving valuable human resources for industrial development and urban construction.



He continued to look down.



The second line on the parchment was construction personnel, with a very detailed list of notes below, including stone masons, tile masons, plasterers, carpenters, laborers, and so on. The total number was over one thousand one hundred people, the vast majority of whom were serfs serving as laborers. It was precisely because of the addition of this new workforce that Border Town could quickly build batches of residential areas and factories—standardizing, mass-producing, and systematizing construction was an important means to accelerate the progress. Although in Roland's eyes, the speed was still not enough, for the locals, it was already considered shockingly unconventional.



The third row is for the mining personnel.

Similar to the construction industry above, the number of local residents in Border Town has dropped to twenty-five, mainly responsible for operating the steam engine, mine registration, and management. The remaining one thousand six hundred are outsiders, including the mercenaries captured during the Battle of Longsong Stronghold and the serfs sent subsequently.

"Several brawls have occurred in the mining area recently," Barov said, "mainly conflicts between the mercenaries and the serfs. This is a hidden danger, Your Highness. There are too many of them, and once they start causing trouble, the twenty-five managers alone cannot control the situation. I suggest that the First Army be responsible for assisting in the guard duty."

"Hmm..." Roland pondered for a moment, "Let's do it that way. We are currently short on manpower and cannot afford to establish a police force. I will speak to Iron Axe; a musket team of about fifty people should be sufficient."

"Police... what is that?"

"You can think of it as a patrol team, but with a much broader jurisdiction. They are basically responsible for all internal security." In this era, there is no distinction between internal and external violence, so having the military take care of public order would not be considered a dark history for oneself. Before dealing with the Church, a massive enemy, he did not plan to divert manpower to build a second violent apparatus.

Ranked fourth is the First Army of Border Town.

After the end of the Stronghold Battle, the First Army's reputation spread throughout the Western Territory—a mere three hundred men defeated the Duke's allied forces of one thousand five hundred, with minimal casualties, causing the stronghold nobles to lose the courage to resist. Following the rewards for their achievements, Roland doubled the size of the First Army to six hundred men. And with the recruitment notice just sent out, eager townspeople filled the entire square. Roland still followed the principle that the people's army should be composed of the people, selecting three hundred locals with decent qualities and no criminal records to join the First Army.

The rest are various technical personnel.



For example, in the smelting and firing industries, the number of people has greatly increased in the past month, from the initial twenty or so to around four hundred. Thanks to the "Kiln Expert" Lucia, the North Slope Kiln Complex can not only produce red bricks but also burn cement and glass. At the same time, three blast furnaces are being set up. Soon after, the ore placed in the stockyard can first go through the blast furnaces for initial smelting, then the ingots can be transported to where they are needed.



As for education, chemistry, industry, and animal husbandry, these combined still account for less than fifty people. Therefore, from a demographic standpoint, Border Town still has a long way to go. However, the fact that a small town, which was originally composed mainly of hunters and miners, could change so much in half a year, can already be considered a groundbreaking transformation.



Nowadays, hunters have all but disappeared, with hunting changing from a survival necessity to a hobby. Excluding those who have joined the First Army or the smelting industry, there are still nearly a thousand people in the town who are unemployed. Once the literacy part of the general education is completed, Roland has decided to pull all these residents into the factories and start the prelude to industrial production.
