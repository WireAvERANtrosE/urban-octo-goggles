## Assassination (Part 2)
The Faceless One felt a chill run through her body. How could this be possible?

She swallowed and whispered, "What joke is this, I am Volt!"

It couldn't be such a coincidence that the other party happened to know her. With so many mercenaries in the camp, could she really remember every single person's name?

Unexpectedly, a cold laugh followed. "Is that so? I never knew that men could also accumulate magic power. Either you are a witch with ulterior motives infiltrating our camp, or you are an extremely rare male witch. But whichever answer it is, it's definitely not the 'Volt' you claim to be. Among the soldiers of the First Army, there isn't a freak like you."



This person... can see the power of evil? Afra's heart sank to the bottom, she knew why she had been discovered. There were more than four witches in the camp, and the woman behind her was also a witch, one with an ability similar to the Eye of Truth. The Church's sacred book of magic power had records of such an ability—it was one of the hundreds of derivative abilities and did not conflict with the main ability.

She hadn't noticed anyone approaching, so... was the other party's main ability to conceal their presence?

"Kneel down now, hands behind your back, and I might spare your life," she ordered, "Do as I say!"

The mercenaries were still fighting on the outskirts and did not notice what was happening in the central clearing, but the four witches by the bonfire had sensed something unusual and turned their gazes over, "What's wrong, Nightingale? What happened?"

This was the last chance, Afra realized. She excelled in assassination, not direct combat, especially without wearing the Divine Stone of Judgement. She was not at an advantage against witches with all sorts of strange abilities. It didn't matter if the witch who could fly escaped, but the witch who could heal the demonic plague had to die here, or else she would pose a serious threat to the Church's plans.



Of course, there was another possibility, that after killing the enemy, she herself would not be able to escape. Thinking of this, her heart couldn't help but tighten, but soon it turned into acceptance—The Church had resisted the devils from hell with all its might in order to unify the four kingdoms, sacrificing many excellent warriors. If she could contribute to this goal, it would be something to be proud of.

She believed that Heather would not forget herself, and her name would likewise be in the future scriptures.

"Don't come over yet," the witch called Nightingale shouted from behind, "There's—"

In that instant, she suddenly made her move, turning and striking with her elbow on the opponent's arm, while ducking her head to avoid the weapon—no one could be fully focused while speaking, hence the saying about holding one's breath and concentrating. This was what the training officer had repeatedly taught her. On the contrary, to escape or attack the unsuspecting, taking advantage of when the other party was speaking was best.

The mechanism hidden in her sleeve was also triggered immediately, a white powder spraying out towards the back—this alchemical powder would release a lot of steam upon contact with water, and if it entered the eyes or mouth, it could instantly incapacitate the opponent. Even if by chance they did not inhale the powder, it would still throw them into disarray for a while.

Next, Afra lunged towards the four witches by the campfire, a blonde woman instantly flying up, while the oldest-looking witch fearlessly shielded the other two. She drew out a sharp, thin dagger, stabbing directly towards the leader—since the three who could not escape were all going to die by her hand, there was no need to differentiate who first.

The moment the dagger pierced the body of her opponent, Afra saw an incredible scene.

A white figure appeared at her front side, the eyes beneath the hood flashing with angry light, where there had clearly been nothing before.

Was it... Nightingale from behind?



That close-range powder eruption, why did it have no effect on her at all? The Faceless almost couldn't believe his own eyes, only to see her raise her hands towards him, the silvery weapon spouting a burst of flame, her body was forcefully pushed hard, and she immediately lost her balance, falling backward to the ground. No, there are still... two people to deal with, Afla tried to stand up, drawing her short sword to stab at the next witch, but even lifting her arm became extremely difficult, her consciousness quickly blurring.



What a pity... A final thought flashed through her mind.



...



After firing the gun, Nightingale remained in place, watching the soldier who was hit in the chest fall, his body starting to twist and shrink, slowly changing back into the appearance of an unfamiliar woman.



—This was the first time she had personally killed a witch.



It wasn't until Lily's anxious cries rang out that Nightingale came back to her senses.



Suppressing the tumultuous emotions in her heart, she put away her gun and ran back to Wendy's side.



"Where are you hurt?"



"It's nothing, I don't feel any pain," Wendy waved her hand to signal everyone not to panic, "It probably didn't penetrate."



"Did the protective suit work?"

"I think it did." She unbuttoned her chest, revealing a slender short sword hanging on the side of her clothes. As the coat opened, the short sword slid out of the hole and fell to the ground without a trace of blood on its tip. Only the outer layer of fabric on the protective suit was punctured with a small hole, while the soft inner layer remained intact.



"You... you really scared me to death," Lily let out a long breath, her legs went weak, and she sat down on the ground, "Don't rush up to block the sword for me! I don't need you to do that for me—I, I, I..."



"It's okay," Wendy patted her head. "See? I'm fine, aren't I?"



Lily drooped her head and buried it in the other's chest, mumbling a muffled acknowledgment.



"I was also taken aback, just focusing on blocking and forgetting to use my own ability," Wendy shook her head. "If I had conjured up a strong wind, she probably wouldn't have been able to stab me."



"It's because you seldom fight with others, it's normal not to react in time." Nightingale consoled.



"Thank goodness for the protective suit," Echo said with a look of relief. "Otherwise, it would have been dangerous this time."



Before we set off, Prince Roland provided each witch with a specially made vest and requested that they never take it off. It was quite light to wear, though it looked a bit thick, seemingly made up of many layers—His Highness mentioned that each layer of silk was coated with Soraya's sky paint, highly flexible and difficult to be penetrated by sharp objects, providing excellent defense against swords and crossbows. Without it to block that stab, Wendy might have had trouble holding on until Nana's healing.



Lightning slowly descended beside the slain witch. "Why did she attack us? Aren't we... the same kind?"



Nightingale stared at the lifeless woman, unable to speak for a long time... The other's eyes were closed, her blue hair scattered on the ground, her expression peaceful, as if she hadn't felt much pain. However, she could never forget that when the other had lunged at Wendy, there was not a hint of hesitation in her eyes, only determination and conviction. It was as if she wasn't committing murder, but rather carrying out her lifelong beliefs. Perhaps in her heart, such an action was the most correct thing to do.



"No," Nightingale sighed softly, "she is not one of us... just a tragic person, that's all."
