## Assassination (Part 2)
The Faceless One felt a chill run through her body, how could this be possible?

She swallowed and spoke in a lower voice, "What joke is this, I am Vort."

It couldn't be such a coincidence that the other party happened to know her, there were so many mercenaries in the camp, could she really remember everyone's name?

Unexpectedly, a cold laugh followed from behind, "Really? I never knew that men could also gather magic power. Either you're a witch with ulterior motives who sneaked into the camp, or an extremely rare male witch. But no matter which answer, it's not the 'Vort' you claim to be. Among the soldiers of the First Army, there is no such freak like you."

This person... can see the power of evil demons? Agatha's heart had already sunk to the bottom, she knew why she had been discovered. There were more than four witches in the camp, and the woman behind her was also a witch, possessing an ability similar to the Eye of Truth. In the Holy Book of Magic Power of the Church, such an ability was recorded—it was one of hundreds of derivative abilities and did not conflict with the main ability.

She had not noticed anyone approaching, so... was the other's main ability to hide their form?

"Kneel down now, hands behind your back, and I can spare your life," she commanded, "Do as I say!"

The mercenaries were still fighting on the perimeter and had not noticed what was happening in the central clearing, but the four witches by the bonfire had sensed the abnormal situation and cast their gazes over, "What's the matter, Nightingale, what happened?"

This was her last chance, Agatha realized. She was skilled at assassination, not frontal combat, especially when not wearing the God's Punishment Stone, she did not have an advantage against witches with various strange abilities. The witch who could fly was not a concern if she ran away, but the witch who could heal the demonic plague had to die here, otherwise, she would pose a serious threat to the Church's plans.



Of course, there was another possibility—that after killing the enemy, she herself would not be able to escape. Thinking of this, her heart involuntarily tightened, but it quickly turned into resignation. The Church had exhausted all its efforts to resist the devils from hell in order to unify the four kingdoms, sacrificing many excellent warriors. If she could contribute to this cause, it would be something to be proud of.



She believed that Heather would not forget her and that her name would likewise be in the future scriptures.



"Don't come over yet," the witch known as Nightingale behind her shouted, "there's—"



In that instant, she suddenly made her move, turning around and elbowing her opponent's arm while ducking her head to avoid getting stabbed—nobody could focus entirely while speaking, which is why there was the saying about holding one's breath and concentrating. This was something the training officer had repeatedly taught her. On the contrary, if one wanted to break free or attack unexpectedly, the best time was when the opponent was speaking.



The mechanism hidden in her sleeve was also triggered at the first opportunity, spraying a white powder backward—this alchemical powder would release a large amount of steam when it met water, and if it entered the eyes or mouth, it could instantly incapacitate the opponent. Even if by chance they didn't inhale the powder, it would still be enough to throw them into disarray.



Next, Afra pounced towards the four witches by the bonfire. A blonde witch instantly took flight, while the oldest-looking witch desperately stood in front of the other two. She drew out a sharp, thin dagger and stabbed directly towards the leader—since the three who could not escape were all going to die by her hand, there was no need to distinguish who was first.



The moment the dagger pierced the body of her opponent, Afra saw an unbelievable sight.



A white figure appeared at her side, and the eyes under the hood sparkled with angry light, where previously there had been nothing.



Was it... the Nightingale behind her?



That close-range powder eruption, why did it have no effect on her at all? The Faceless almost couldn't believe his eyes, only to see her raising her hands towards him, the silvery weapon shooting out a burst of flame, her body forcefully pushed hard, suddenly losing balance and falling backwards onto the ground. No good, there are still... two more to deal with, Afra tried to stand up, drawing her short sword to stab at the next witch, but found that even lifting her hand had become extremely difficult, her consciousness quickly blurring.



What a pity... was the last thought that flashed through her mind.



...



After firing her gun, Nightingale remained in place, watching the soldier who had been hit in the chest fall down, his body beginning to twist and shrink, slowly changing back into the appearance of an unfamiliar woman.



—This was the first time she had personally killed a witch.



It wasn't until Lily's anxious calling broke out that Nightingale came back to her senses.



Suppressing the surging emotions inside her, she put away her gun and ran back to Wendy's side.



"Where are you hurt?"



"I'm fine, I don't feel any pain at all," Wendy waved her hand, signaling everyone not to panic, "It probably didn't stab in."



"Did the protective suit work?"

"I think it should have." She undid the buttons on her chest, and a slender short sword hung on one side of her clothes. As the jacket opened up, the short sword slid out of the hole and fell to the ground, with not a single drop of blood on the tip. The protective suit only had a small hole in the outer layer of fabric, while the soft inner layer remained intact.

"You... you really scared me to death," Lily let out a long breath and weakly sat down on the ground, "Don't rush up to block a sword for me! I don't need you to do such things for me—I, I, I..."

"It's alright," Wendy patted her on the head, "I'm not hurt, am I?"

Lily hung her head and buried it in the other's chest, mumbling a muffled hum.

"I was also scared stiff, just focusing on blocking and forgetting to use my own abilities," Wendy shook her head, "If I had summoned a strong wind, she probably wouldn't have been able to stab me."

"It's because you rarely fight with people, it's normal to not react in time," Nightingale consoled.

"It's a good thing we had the protective suits," Echo said with a relieved expression, "Otherwise, it would have been dangerous this time."

Before leaving, Prince Roland had issued a special vest to every witch and requested that they never take off this piece of clothing. It was very light to wear, even though it seemed a bit thick, apparently consisting of many layers—His Highness said that each layer of silk was painted with Soraya's sky coating, which was extremely flexible and difficult to be pierced by sharp objects, providing excellent defense against swords and crossbows. Without it to block this thrust, Wendy might have had a hard time holding on until Nana's treatment.



Lightning slowly descended to the side of the witch who had been killed. "Why did she attack us? Aren't we... the same kind?"



Nightingale stared at the lifeless woman, unable to speak for a long time... The other's eyes were closed, her blue hair scattered on the ground, her expression peaceful, as if she hadn't felt much pain. However, she could never forget when the woman had pounced towards Wendy, there wasn't a hint of hesitation in her eyes, only determination and a sense of justification. It was as if she wasn't committing murder, but rather fulfilling her lifelong beliefs. Perhaps in her heart, such an action was the most correct behavior.



"No," Nightingale sighed softly, "she is not one of us... just a pitiful person, that's all."
