Since the arrival of the five witches from Sleeping Island at Border Town, Roland had been in a state of excitement. After the banquet ended, he found himself lying in bed, unable to fall asleep. Left with no choice, he got up to drink half a glass of white liquor, forcibly putting his body to sleep.



The next day, when the summer cicadas in the courtyard began their "zi ya" chirping, he was already wide awake. He got out of bed with vigor, washed up, and walked into his office—by this time, the sky was just beginning to brighten with the first light of dawn, spreading evenly through the floor-to-ceiling windows into the room.



Roland looked around and did not see the familiar figure that he was used to. On a normal day, when he pushed the door open, he would always see Nightingale lying on the chair, showing a lazy demeanor. He couldn't help but smile slightly as he sat down at the desk, took out his notebook from the drawer, and began to plan the training program for the witches.



Helping the newcomers get familiar with the environment and integrate into the group was naturally something that Wendy and Scroll would do. What he had to do was to launch a charm offensive, letting the visiting witches enjoy the unique comfortable life here. It didn't necessarily have to be a success only if they stayed in Border Town; even if they returned home, it would be excellent publicity for his domain.



When the sun had fully risen, Nightingale finally appeared in the office, "Oh? You woke up really early today. Is it true what Lily said, that you couldn't wait to see the new witches?"



"What are you talking about," Roland chuckled and placed a bag of dried fish on the table, "How did it go with the new sisters last night?"



"Sisters?" She pursed her lips, "Don't trust them too much."



"What happened?"



Nightingale hooked the bag with her finger and turned to sit back in the reclining chair, "That witch named Sylvie, half of what she says is a lie. Though it's not to the extent of harboring ill intentions, she definitely has quite a few ulterior motives."



"Mmm... I can understand that," Roland said nonchalantly, "She probably wants to see if I am the real Roland Wimbledon."

"What?" Nightingale was slightly startled.

"If someone close to you changed dramatically in personality, wouldn't you wonder if they had been replaced, or controlled by someone else?" he said with a laugh. "I guess Tilly sees me like that. In the capital, I was known for being idle, ignorant, a bully, and a coward. How could someone like that stand up to protect witches?"

In fact, any bad comment to describe the fourth prince was not an exaggeration. He even recalled an incident from his childhood: the fourth prince broke several crystal jars while playing in the palace, and to avoid punishment, he not only shifted all the blame onto Tilly Wimbledon but also staged the scene, throwing his six- or seven-year-old sister into the glass shards. With such a dark history, it's no wonder people had a deep impression of him. Now, it was perfectly normal to suspect that the brother, whose personality had changed so drastically, was no longer the same person, and anyone would want to investigate.

"Listening to you, I also really want to know," Nightingale asked curiously, "Are you really Roland Wimbledon?"

"I am and I am not," Roland spread his hands.

She was immediately dumbfounded, "Why does my ability tell me that what you're saying is true?"

"Because that's the fact." Nightingale's ability could only detect deliberate lies, and he didn't believe he was lying.

"..." She frowned and thought hard for a long time, finally placing a hand on her forehead and deciding to give up thinking, "Forget it, I'll just go and ask Anna directly later. Anyway, as long as you are the Roland I know, that's good enough."



"Of course, I've been myself from the moment I met you," Roland said with a smile.



After breakfast, the five witches from Sleeping Island were brought to the office by Wendy.



"Good morning, Your Highness," the five women bowed.



"Relax, I am not a person who is very particular about etiquette. You can address me in the same way as you address Tilly," Roland waved his hand, "For the first week, I will not arrange any work for you, mainly to familiarize yourself with the town's environment and life. You can freely visit Border Town, no one will speak ill of you or try to capture you for a bounty because you are witches—I have eradicated the Church's influence from the Western Territory, so this place is a land of freedom, just like Sleeping Island."



"I believe you all know the reasons behind magic bite, so the necessary practice should not be neglected. There are no restrictions during the daytime, just don't forget to come back for lunch, and after dinner, there will be primary education classes, including literacy and reading and writing, as well as simple mathematics and natural science. Tilly might have mentioned to you that a witch's power can be further enhanced beyond the Adult Day, so mastering this knowledge is very necessary, and those interested can join the town's witches for classes."



"Additionally, you will receive a Gold Royal as compensation every month, as well as weekends and paid leave—if you don't understand, you can ask Wendy. In short, your daily life will be the same as in the Witch Union, Sleeping Island is a home for witches, and Border Town is the same," Roland paused, "Now, let's test your abilities first. Tilly's description in the letter was not very clear, and I would like to see for myself. It's not convenient here, let's move to a more spacious place."



"Just a moment, Your Highness, I have something to give you," Sylvie spoke up.



"What is it?"



She opened the package she was holding and placed several yellowed parchment papers and a letter on the table, "Lady Tilly found these documents in the ruins of a fjord, and she has written all her questions for you in this letter."



Roland opened the envelope with confusion. The letter was not long, and he quickly reached the end, but the content described within stirred up a huge wave in his heart.



A man-made stone island slumbering on the seabed, the unpredictable rise and fall of tides, a lookout mirror that could still operate after hundreds of years, and a stone gate built upon the cliff... It was incredible. Why would such an unfathomable relic exist in the Fjords? And Tilly's question at the end of the letter sent a chill down his spine—after scanning the parchment a few times, he found the text somewhat familiar.



"Quickly, summon Scroll," Roland instructed Nightingale.



Scroll soon hurried back to the castle from the City Hall, and when she summoned the Book of Magic, the prince couldn't help but frown.



The 'Holy Book' that Cara had brought from the relics of the eastern border forest was written in the exact same script as the documents found in the relics of the Fjords! Tilly's speculation in the letter was confirmed; these ancient relics were all crafted by the same people.



If it was the Church that built all of this, why would they abandon everything? And it was not just these magnificent structures; even the records from four hundred and fifty years ago had been completely erased. What exactly were they trying to hide?



Even the scorching summer sun could not bring a hint of warmth to Roland; he only felt a chilling coldness creeping up from the soles of his feet, sinister and bitter.



Were the stone tower that Lightning discovered in the Misty Forest and these relics related? And what about the demonic beasts, devils, and the Holy City of Taquila... What on earth happened four hundred and fifty years ago? A strong sense of unease surged in Roland's heart.
