## Mystery
Since the arrival of the five witches from Sleeping Island at Border Town, Roland had been in a state of excitement. After the banquet ended, he found himself lying in bed, unable to fall asleep. He eventually got up and drank half a glass of white liquor, forcing his body into sleep.



The next day, when the summer cicadas in the courtyard began to make their "zhi ya" chirping, he was already awake. He got out of bed energized, quickly washed up, and walked into his office—by then, the sky had just started to lighten, and the first rays of dawn were evenly spilling into the room through the floor-to-ceiling windows.



Roland looked around and did not see the familiar figure that he was used to. Usually, when he would push the door open, he could always see Nightingale lying on the chair, displaying a lazy demeanor. He couldn't help but smile slightly, sat down at the desk, took out his notebook from the drawer, and began planning the training program for the witches.



Helping the newcomers get familiar with the environment and integrate into the group would naturally be taken care of by Wendy and Scroll, but what he needed to do was to launch a charm offensive, letting the visiting witches enjoy the unique comforts of life here. It was not necessary to keep them in Border Town to consider it a success; even if they went back, it would still serve as excellent publicity for his territory.



When the sun was fully risen, Nightingale finally appeared in the office, "Oh? You're up early today. Is it really like Lily said, you can't contain your excitement for the new witches?"



"What nonsense," Roland laughed and placed a bag of dried fish on the table, "How did it go with the new sisters last night?"



"Sisters?" She pursed her lips, "Don't trust them too much."



"What happened?"



Nightingale reached out to pick up the bag, turned around, and sat back in the recliner, "That witch named Sylvie, half of what she says is a lie. Although it's not to the point of harboring malicious intentions, she definitely has quite a few tricks up her sleeve."



"Hmm... understandable," Roland said nonchalantly, "she probably wants to see if I'm really Roland Wimbledon."

"What?" Nightingale blinked in surprise.

"If your relative changed dramatically, you would also wonder if they had been replaced or controlled, right?" he said with a laugh, "I guess Tilly sees me that way. Back in the capital, I was notorious for being lazy, ignorant, and a bully, how could I possibly stand up to protect witches?"

Indeed, any terrible comment made to describe the Fourth Prince wouldn't be an exaggeration. He even found such an episode in his childhood memories: the Fourth Prince accidentally broke several crystal vases while playing in the palace. To avoid punishment, he not only pushed all the blame onto Tilly Wimbledon but also staged the scene, leaving his six or seven-year-old sister amidst the shards of glass. With such a dark history, it's no wonder that others have a deep impression of him. Now, it's only natural to suspect that a brother who has dramatically changed is no longer the same person, and anyone would want to investigate.

"Listening to you, I'm quite curious," Nightingale asked with interest, "so are you really Roland Wimbledon?"

"I am, yet I am not," Roland spread his hands.

She was immediately taken aback, "Why does my ability tell me that what you said is true?"

"Because that's the fact." Nightingale's ability could only detect deliberate lies, and he didn't believe he was lying.

"..." She frowned and pondered for a long time, finally holding her forehead, deciding to give up thinking, "Forget it, I'll just ask Anna directly later. Anyway, as long as you are the Roland I'm familiar with, that's enough for me."



"Of course, ever since I met you, I have always been myself," Roland said with a smile.



After breakfast, the five witches from Sleeping Island were brought to the office by Wendy.



"Good morning, Your Highness," the five bowed and greeted.



"Relax, I'm not someone who is particularly strict about etiquette. You can address me in the same way you address Tilly," Roland waved his hand, "For the first week, I won't arrange any work for you. The main goal is to familiarize yourselves with the town's environment and life. You are free to visit Border Town, and no one will speak ill of you or attempt to capture you for a bounty because you are witches—I have already eradicated the Church's power from the Western Territory, so this place is a land of freedom, just like Sleeping Island."



"I suppose you all know the reason behind the devouring of magic power, so necessary practice should not be neglected. There are no restrictions during the day; just don't forget to come back for lunch. After dinner, there will be elementary education classes, including literacy and reading and writing, as well as simple mathematics and natural sciences. Tilly might have mentioned to you that a witch's power can be further enhanced beyond the adult day, so it's crucial to master this knowledge. Those interested are welcome to attend classes with the town's witches."



"In addition, you will receive a monthly payment of one Gold Royal, along with weekends and paid leave—if you don't understand, you can ask Wendy. In short, your daily life will be the same as in the Witch Cooperation Association. Sleeping Island is a home for witches, and Border Town is just the same," Roland paused, "Now, let's test your abilities. Tilly's descriptions in the letter were not very clear, and I'd like to see for myself. This place isn't suitable for that, let's move to a more spacious area."



"Please wait a moment, Your Highness, I have something to give you," said Sylvie.



"What is it?"



She opened the parcel in her hand, placing several yellowed parchment papers and a letter on the table, "Lady Tilly found these documents in the ruins of a fjord, and she has written all her questions for you in this letter."



Roland opened the envelope with confusion. The letter was not long, and he quickly reached the end, but the content inside stirred a mighty wave in his heart. A man-made stone island sleeping at the bottom of the sea, the unpredictable rise and fall of tides, the watchtower that still functioned after hundreds of years, and the stone door built on the cliff... It was simply incredible. Why would there be such an unbelievable ruin in the fjord? And Tilly's question at the end sent a chill down his spine—after scanning the parchment a few times, he found the writing somewhat familiar. 



"Bring Scroll over," Roland ordered Nightingale. 



Scroll soon rushed back to the castle from the City Hall, and when she summoned the Book of Magic, the prince couldn't help but frown. 



The 'Holy Book' that Cara brought out from the relics of the Eastern Region forest, and the documents found in the ruins of the fjord, were written in exactly the same script! Tilly's speculation in the letter was confirmed; all these ancient ruins were made by the same group of people. 



If it was the Church that built all this, why would they abandon everything? And not just these grand structures, even the records from four hundred and fifty years ago had been completely erased. What exactly were they trying to hide? 



Even the summer sun at its peak couldn't bring a hint of warmth to Roland, as he felt a creeping chill rising from the soles of his feet, gloomy and cold. 



Was the stone tower that Lightning discovered in the Misty Forest also related to these ruins? And what about the demonic beasts, devils, and the Holy City of Taquila... What exactly happened four hundred and fifty years ago? A profound unease surged in Roland's heart.
