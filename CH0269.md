## First General Meeting (Part 2)
When it was the turn of the Chemical Industry Department, Kyle snorted, "Your Highness, I hope you can find the real person in charge as soon as possible. I really don't want to attend this kind of meeting a second time."

Roland rolled his eyes secretly. After becoming a leader, he found that some things had to be selectively ignored. Where could he easily find someone with expertise in both alchemy and chemistry? "Do you have any idea about the mass production of the two acids?"

"No," Kyle shrugged, "That's why I need to devote more effort and more manpower to research this project, instead of sitting here wasting time," having stayed in the town for so long, he also picked up some 'Roland-style vocabulary,' "If I really have to report, I can only say that the laboratory is short-staffed, the more people the better. Additionally, the five who joined recently are young but quite sharp, it seems that the basic education initiative you started is somewhat useful."



Hmm, the Chief Alchemist was probably the most disrespectful in his words and attitude towards himself, but considering the other's age and enthusiasm for chemical experiments, Roland didn't feel any resentment. After all, after experiencing an explosion accident and being completely healed by Nana, his first reaction was that he could conduct experiments without any concerns, and he even planned to taste different acids, which was a level of zeal that was unmatched.



"Alright... continue your research, I will have Barov find a way to fill the personnel gap."

"By the way, Your Highness," Kyle spoke again, "Is that 'Intermediate Chemistry' book of yours written yet? If I could take a look at it, maybe I could figure out the mass production of acids earlier."

"I've said it during the knighthood ceremony, as soon as the apprentices and assistants you've trained can fill the new laboratory, I will hand over the book to you," Roland spread his hands. In reality, not a single word of the book had been written yet—just the elementary chemistry had already exhausted his limited knowledge of chemistry; intermediate chemistry would probably not make up even a few pages of content even if he racked his brains.



The fourth to report was the Minister of Construction, Karl Barton.

"First of all, I would like to thank Sir Scroll," he began by nodding to Scroll in acknowledgment, "I am genuinely pleased to know that those children were able to graduate successfully."



Compared to the chief alchemist, Mr. Stonemason's social talents are worlds apart, and Scroll nodded in response, "It's what I should do."



Then Karl opened his notebook, which he carried with him, and spoke methodically, "Currently, various projects in the town are progressing steadily, the main ones being the Kingdom Main Street, Redwater Bridge, the new residential district, and the new city walls. The construction of Kingdom Main Street has reached four thousand five hundred people, half of whom come from Longsong Stronghold, and it's expected to be completed by next spring. Redwater Bridge is still undergoing the construction of underground cement wall protection, the residential district has expanded to near the old city walls, with about a thousand people working on it. As long as the supply of bricks and cement can be ensured, the task of relocating all the refugees from the Eastern Region into the town before the Evil Months should be completed."



Since Karl often reported the progress of the projects to Roland on a regular basis, he summarized this statement very briefly, for instance, he did not mention the expansion of the castle district and the construction of the Witch Building. Furthermore, after the location of the new city walls was determined and the lines were drawn, the construction was entirely carried out by Lily alone, with progress maintained at about a hundred meters per day.



"Good work," Roland nodded, the Department of Construction was the department with the largest allocation of both personnel and funding, hence the most results, "While accelerating the construction, don't forget to promote Border Town's preferential policies. These laborers from the stronghold, after a year of practice, can also be considered qualified craftsmen. You should try to keep them in town as much as possible."



"Yes, Your Highness," Karl responded.



"Next... Iron Axe."



It was Iron Axe's first time participating in such a meeting, and he seemed somewhat out of his element. He cleared his throat, "Your Highness, the military is mainly focused on two things. First, the Second Army has completed its basic training and is ready to be dispatched to the stronghold. Second, with the addition of new blood, the First Army currently has eight hundred and twenty-five people. Excluding the three hundred and fifty people in the artillery team, the rest of the soldiers have all been equipped with revolving rifles. That's all I have to report." After reporting, he gave a military salute.



"Good, let the Second Army set off tomorrow, and remember to place reliable people in the team. Training and ideological cultivation must not be interrupted in the stronghold, and report back to the town weekly," Roland instructed.



The last to speak was Barov, who took a look around at everyone before bowing leisurely to Roland, "Your Highness, since the last payment to the Margret Chamber of Commerce for transportation and the Tassa mission expenditures, the treasury of the City Hall has decreased severely. In addition to the recent bountiful harvest, the Agriculture Department still purchases grain at the normal market price, resulting in only a little over two thousand Gold royals remaining in the treasury. This is quite a dangerous threshold."



Two thousand Gold Royals... It was undoubtedly a huge sum compared to last winter, but Roland was also clear that the situation of the town had changed dramatically since then. Just the monthly payment for the salaries of over five thousand workers in the Department of Construction was a huge expense, and there were also the high salaries for the First Army, the factories, the chemical laboratory, and the City Hall, all of which required a significant amount of Gold Royals.



In other words, Border Town was now earning money quickly, but also spending it just as fast—this was still based on the situation where most materials and machinery were self-sufficient.



"I understand. However, when the Margrave caravan arrives at the beginning of next month, we'll be able to earn some income by selling steam engines," Roland responded. "Moreover, purchasing grain and transporting refugees are not part of the daily expenses, so the treasury should be able to steadily increase over the next half year. You don't need to worry too much." He paused. "Furthermore, I plan to raise everyone's salaries."



"A raise?" Barov was taken aback.



"That's right. The City Hall is no longer that small institution that could be run by a dozen people. Your workload has increased significantly, so naturally, your compensation should go up as well," the prince said with a smile. "From this month, your salary will increase to five Gold Royals per month, department heads will get two Gold Royals per month, and then apprentices and assistants will also be adjusted accordingly. Don't worry, this amount of money is not much, just around twenty or thirty Gold Royals in total."



Although five Gold Royals was not a substantial amount for the position of Chief Officer of the City Hall, Roland knew that what Barov loved more was power—currently, all of Border Town's financial revenues and expenditures were accounted for and disbursed by him, and there were no supervisory departments set up. He could easily embezzle funds and earn several hundred times his income. Yet, so far, there had been no signs of embezzlement.



Of course, apart from relying on the individual's conscience, Roland could also maintain the integrity of the department with the help of Nightingale's abilities. Under her questioning, no one could hide their misconduct.



"Additionally, there is something that everyone may already know," he continued, "I plan to officially build a city here after the Evil Months end this year. In other words, the town will be upgraded to a real city. This great city will extend west to the Barbarian Land, east to the Longsong Stronghold, south to the hilly seas, with its walls being the natural mountains and impregnable fortresses. Its area will far exceed the capital, and even any other city in the Four Kingdoms."



"So you still need to press on with your work at hand, to welcome the establishment of the new city with an even better posture," Roland paused, then said word by word, "I hope that this city, even in the midst of boundless winter, can be as warm as spring."
