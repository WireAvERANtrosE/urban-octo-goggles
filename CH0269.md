## The Inaugural General Assembly (Part 2)
When it was the turn of the Chemical Industry Department, Kyle snorted, "Your Highness, I hope you can find the real person in charge as soon as possible. I really do not wish to attend such a meeting for a second time."

Roland rolled his eyes secretly. After becoming a leader, he found that some words had to be selectively ignored. Where could one easily find a talent who was versed in both alchemy and chemistry? "Do you have any ideas about the mass production of the two acids?"

"No," Kyle shrugged, "That's why I need to devote more energy and more manpower to researching this project, instead of sitting here wasting time," he said, his words now carrying some 'Roland-style vocabulary' after having spent a long time in the town. "If I must report, I can only say that the laboratory is short-staffed, and the more people, the better. Also, the five who joined recently are quite young but all quite clever. It seems that the elementary education you've set up is somewhat useful."

Hmm, the Chief Alchemist was probably the most disrespectful in terms of his words and attitude, but considering the other party's age and his enthusiasm for chemical experiments, Roland did not harbor any resentment. After all, Kyle's first reaction after surviving an explosion and being completely healed by Nana was to carry out experiments without any fear and even intending to taste different acid solutions—his fervor was unmatched.

"Alright... continue with your research. I will have Barov figure out a way to fill the personnel gap."

"By the way, Your Highness," Kyle spoke again, "Have you finished writing that 'Intermediate Chemistry' book of yours? If you could let me have a look at it, perhaps I could figure out a method for acid production on a large scale sooner."

"I have already said during the knighthood ceremony that once the apprentices and assistants you've trained fill the new laboratory, I will hand over the book to you," Roland spread his hands. In fact, the book had not been started at all—the elementary chemistry had already exhausted his limited knowledge of chemistry, and intermediate chemistry would hardly fill a few pages even if he racked his brains.



The fourth to report was the Minister of Construction, Karl Barton.

"First, I would like to extend my thanks to Lord Scroll," he began, nodding towards Scroll, "I am truly delighted to know that the batch of children has graduated successfully."



Compared to the chief alchemist, Mr. Stonemason's talent for socializing is truly like the difference between heaven and earth. The scholar also nodded and returned the salute, saying, "This is what I should do."



Then Karl opened the notebook he carried with him and spoke methodically: "Currently, all the projects in the town are progressing steadily, with the main ones being the Kingdom Main Street, Redwater River Bridge, new residential district, and the new city wall. The construction of the Kingdom Main Street now employs four thousand five hundred people, half of whom come from the Longsong Stronghold, and it is expected to be completed by next spring. The Redwater River Bridge is still undergoing underground cement wall construction, the residential district has expanded up to the vicinity of the old city wall with about a thousand people working on it, and as long as the supply of bricks and cement can be guaranteed, we should be able to complete the established task of relocating all the refugees from the Eastern Region into the town before the Evil Months arrive."



Since Karl often reported the progress of the projects to Roland, this statement was very brief. For example, he didn't mention the expansion of the castle district and the construction of the Witch Building. Furthermore, after the new city wall's position was marked out, the entire construction was carried out by Lian alone, maintaining a daily progress of about a hundred meters.



"You've worked hard," Roland nodded. The Department of Construction was the department with the largest allocation of personnel and funds, so it had the most achievements, "While accelerating the construction, don't forget to promote the preferential policies of Border Town. These laborers from the stronghold, after a year of practice, can also be considered qualified craftsmen now. You should try your best to keep them in the town."



"Yes, Your Highness," Karl replied.



"Next... Iron Axe."



It was the first time for Iron Axe to participate in such a meeting, and he seemed somewhat uncomfortable. He cleared his throat, "Your Highness, the army is mainly concerned with two matters. First, the Second Army has completed basic training and can be dispatched to the stronghold at any time. Second, with the addition of new recruits, the First Army now has eight hundred and twenty-five people. Excluding the three hundred and fifty people in the Artillery Team, the rest of the soldiers have all been equipped with revolving rifles. That's all I have to report." After finishing his report, he gave a military salute.



"Good, let the Second Army set off tomorrow. Remember to place reliable personnel within the ranks, and do not interrupt the daily training and ideological cultivation in the stronghold. Also, report the situation to the town every week," Roland instructed.



The last to speak was Barov. He looked around at everyone before saluting Roland at a leisurely pace, "Your Highness, since the last payment to the Margrave Chamber of Commerce for transportation and the expenses for Theo's mission, the treasury of the City Hall has seen a significant decrease. Coupled with the recent bountiful harvest, the Agricultural Department has continued to purchase grain at normal market prices, resulting in a remaining balance of just over two thousand Gold Royals in the treasury, which is quite a dangerous threshold."



Two thousand Gold Royals... Compared to the previous winter, that was undoubtedly a huge sum of money, but Roland was also aware that the situation in the town had changed dramatically. Just the monthly payment for the wages of over five thousand workers in the Department of Engineering was a huge expense, and the First Army, factory, chemical laboratory, and the City Hall, which were considered high-paying at the moment, all required substantial amounts of Gold Royals.



In other words, Border Town was now earning money quickly, but also spending it just as fast—this was still based on the situation where most materials and machinery were self-sufficient.



"I understand. However, at the beginning of next month, when the Margaret Caravan arrives in town, we will be able to earn some income by selling steam engines," Roland responded, "Moreover, purchasing food and transporting refugees are not part of the regular expenses, so in the next half year, the treasury reserves should be able to steadily increase, you don't need to worry too much." He paused, "Also, I plan to raise everyone's salaries."



"A raise?" Barov was taken aback.



"That's right, the City Hall is no longer that institution that runs on just a dozen people, your workload has increased significantly, so naturally, your compensation should go up." The prince smiled, "Starting from this month, your salary will be raised to five Gold Royals per month, department heads will receive two Gold Royals per month, and then according to this ratio, apprentices and assistants will also be adjusted upwards. Rest assured, the money is not much, just around twenty to thirty Gold Royals in total."



Even though five Gold Royals were not considered a generous amount for the position of the City Hall's Supervisor, Roland knew that what Barov loved more was power—currently, all of Border Town's financial revenues and expenditures were managed and distributed by him, and there were no supervisory departments established, allowing him to pocket several hundred times the income if he so wished. And so far, there had been no signs of him embezzling public funds.



Of course, besides relying on the individual's conscience, Roland could also make use of Nightingale's abilities to maintain the integrity of the department; under her interrogation, no one could hide their misdeeds.



"Additionally, there's something that everyone might already know," he continued, "I plan to build a city here after this year's Evil Months are over. In other words, the town will be upgraded to a true city. This great city will stretch west to the Barren Lands, east to Longsong Stronghold, and south to the Chishui River and the Sea, with natural mountains and dangerous terrain as its walls, and its area will far exceed the King's City, or any city in the four major kingdoms."



"So you all still need to press on with your work at hand, to welcome the establishment of the new city in a better stance," Roland paused, then said word by word, "I hope this city, even in the boundless cold of winter, can still be as warm as spring."
